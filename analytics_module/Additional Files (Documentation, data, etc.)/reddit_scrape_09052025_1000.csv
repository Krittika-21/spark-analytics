When Bill and Melinda French Gates created the Gates Foundation in 2000, they had planned for the organization to continue its work, using their remaining fortune, for several decades after they died. But now, the billionaire Microsoft founder says he doesn’t want to wait that long to give away most of his wealth.

Gates announced on Thursday that he now plans to distribute “virtually all” of his wealth — around $200 billion, he estimates — within the next 20 years, before shuttering the foundation on December 31, 2045.

The announcement comes as President Donald Trump’s administration is working to slash funding for health, foreign aid and other public assistance programs — the types of causes the Gates Foundation supports — raising concerns about stalled progress on research and other crucial projects.

Gates wants to accelerate the foundation’s work on global health and equity initiatives and hopes the move will set a model for other billionaires, he said in a blog post published Thursday morning. The pledge builds on Gates’ track record of promoting philanthropy. He, along with ex-wife French Gates and Warren Buffett, launched the Giving Pledge in 2010 to encourage wealthy individuals to donate most of their fortunes to charitable causes either during their lifetimes or in their wills. It now has more than 240 signatories.

“People will say a lot of things about me when I die, but I am determined that ‘he died rich’ will not be one of them,” Gates, who turns 70 later this year, wrote. “There are too many urgent problems to solve for me to hold onto resources that could be used to help people.”

The Gates Foundation, one of the world’s largest philanthropies, has already given away more than $100 billion since its founding, including to develop new vaccines, diagnostic tools and treatment delivery mechanisms to fight disease around the world. Gates has increased the pace of his giving in recent years, especially following the pandemic, but Thursday’s announcement marks a dramatic acceleration in the mobilization of his wealth. The Gates Foundation called it the “largest philanthropic commitment in modern history.”

Over the next 20 years, the Gates Foundation will focus on three main goals: ending preventable deaths of moms and babies, eradicating deadly infectious diseases and lifting hundreds of millions of people around the world out of poverty.

In its announcement, the foundation raised concerns about what it described as stagnant global health trends. And in an interview with the Financial Times published Thursday, Gates accused fellow billionaire Elon Musk of “killing the world’s poorest children” because of his work at the Department of Government Efficiency cutting US international aid programs. In an event in New York on Thursday announcing the commitment, Gates said he met with Trump in February to express his concerns, in particular, about cuts to USAID.

During that event — attended by billionaire Mike Bloomberg, singer Jon Batiste and other philanthropic partners — Gates Foundation CEO Mark Suzman said the world is in a moment “where we are facing, literally, the toughest political and economic headwinds to our agenda since we were established.” He added that “much of (our) amazing progress is at risk.”

However, in his blog post Thursday, Gates expressed optimism that advancements in artificial intelligence, in combination with his giving, could increase the rate of progress.

Gates’ current net worth is $108 billion; Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index ranks him as the fifth wealthiest person in the world. Now, he said his net worth will fall 99% by 2045. The $200 billion he expects to give away through the foundation over the next 20 years will come from its existing $77 billion endowment and his personal wealth, including any earnings from ongoing business investments such as TerraPower, the nuclear power company he founded,

French Gates exited the Gates Foundation last year following the couple’s high-profile divorce in 2021. She said in 2022 that she would not give away the bulk of her wealth through the Gates Foundation.

The announcement comes weeks after Microsoft, now worth more than $3 trillion, marked 50 years since it was founded by Gates. “It feels right that I celebrate the milestone by committing to give away the resources I earned through the company,” he wrote."|"New York CNN —When Bill and Melinda French Gates created the Gates Foundation in 2000, they had planned for the organization to continue its work, using their remaining fortune, for several decades after they died.

The poor performance comes after a first quarter in the red and a disappointing full year in 2024.

Despite it still being one of the largest electric car makers in the world, Tesla’s grip on the market is weakening month after month. That’s especially true in Europe, where buyers have plenty of alternatives to Tesla’s aging lineup of battery-powered cars.

More and more people in Europe’s largest EV markets are ditching Teslas in favor of pretty much anything else, either because they want nothing to do with CEO Elon Musk’s antics or simply because they found a better car somewhere else.

Whatever the reason, the sales figures are disappointing, to say the least. In April, Tesla sales went down an astonishing 81% in Sweden—the lowest level since October 2022. In the Netherlands, Tesla sales decreased 73.8% compared to the same month last year. It’s the same story in Denmark and France, where the American automaker’s numbers fell by 67% and 59% respectively. In Portugal, the fall wasn’t as abrupt, but at 33%, it’s still nothing to write home about.

All of this is despite Tesla’s best efforts to rejuvenate its presence in Europe with the launch of the refreshed Model Y. The electric crossover has long been the company’s breadwinner, and has led the sales charts in Europe. But even with styling and under-the-skin upgrades courtesy of the facelift, the crossover has had a hard time recapturing Europeans’ attention.

In the first quarter of this year, all-electric car sales in the European Union went up by 23.9%. Despite this, Tesla’s sales in the region plummeted by 45% to just 36,167 units, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA). At the same time, Tesla’s market share went from 2.4% last year to 1.3% in the first quarter of this year.

In the enlarged market of the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the European Free Trade Association (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland), Tesla sales fell by 37.3% in the first quarter as overall EV sales went up 28%.

In the United States, the company had a softer fall, but a fall nonetheless. While total EV sales grew 11.4% in the first quarter, Tesla’s numbers went down 8.6%, according to data from Cox Automotive.

Tesla’s latest woes in Europe come hot on the heels of a disappointing year for the name that was once hailed as a pioneer in the EV space. Last year, Tesla posted its worst global delivery numbers in over two years, with a 13% drop year-over-year.

The big question now is: can Tesla come back from its sales slump? Judging from the hype surrounding the affordable Slate electric pickup, one would argue that what Tesla needs most right now is that long-delayed cheap EV. The company seems to have figured out so much, with a more affordable model potentially seeing the light of day next month. We still don't know what that car will be, though. One report said it could be a stripped-down, smaller Model Y, while Musk himself seems hell-bent on selling people a two-door, steering wheel-less robotaxi running unproven software.

The company said Thursday that the cost comprises $700 million in cash and 11 million shares of Coinbase class A common stock. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the year.

Shares of Coinbase rose more than 5%.

The acquisition positions Coinbase as an international leader in crypto derivatives by open interest and options volume, Greg Tusar, vice president of institutional product, said in a blog post – which could allow it take on big players like Binance. Coinbase operates the largest marketplace for buying and selling cryptocurrencies within the U.S., but has a smaller share of the global crypto market, where activity largely takes place on Binance.

Deribit facilitated more than $1 trillion in trading volume last year and has about $30 billion of current open interest on the platform.

""We're excited to join forces with Coinbase to power a new era in global crypto derivatives,"" Deribit CEO Luuk Strijers said in a statement. ""As the leading crypto options platform, we've built a strong, profitable business, and this acquisition will accelerate the foundation we laid while providing traders with even more opportunities across spot, futures, perpetuals, and options – all under one trusted brand. Together with Coinbase, we're set to shape the future of the global crypto derivatives market.""

Tusar also noted that Deribit has a ""consistent track record"" of generating positive adjusted EBITDA the company believes will grow as a combined entity.

""One of the things we liked most about this deal is that it's not just a game changer for our international expansion plans — it immediately diversifies our revenue and enhances profitability,"" Tusar told CNBC.

The deal comes at a time when the crypto industry is riding regulatory tailwinds from the first ever pro-crypto White House. Support of the industry has fueled crypto M&A activity in recent weeks. In March, crypto exchange Kraken agreed to acquire NinjaTrader for $1.5 billion, and last month Ripple agreed to buy prime broker Hidden Road.

By structuring the deal as a cash-and-stock transaction, Coinbase still should have bandwidth to make other acquisitions if there is an opportunity. As of Dec. 31, Coinbase had $8.5 billion in cash on its balance sheet."|"Coinbase agreed to acquire Dubai-based Deribit, a major crypto derivatives exchange, for $2.9 billion, the largest deal in the crypto industry to date.

Last year, banks quickly raised interest rates to record levels and added new monthly fees on credit cards when a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule threatened a key revenue source for the industry.

Now, they're far more reluctant to reverse those steps, even after bank trade groups succeeded in killing the CFPB rule in federal court last month.

Synchrony and Bread Financial, two of the biggest players in the business of issuing branded credit cards for the likes of Amazon , Lowe's and Wayfair , are keeping the higher rates in place, executives said in recent conference calls.

""We feel pretty comfortable that the rule has been vacated,"" Synchrony CEO Brian Doubles said on April 22. ""With that said, we don't currently have plans to roll anything back in terms of the changes that we made.""

His counterpart at Bread, CEO Ralph Andretta, echoed that sentiment, ""At this point, we're not intending to roll back those changes, and we've talked to the partners about that.""

The CEOs celebrated the end of a proposed CFPB regulation that was meant to limit what Americans would pay in credit card late fees, an effort that the industry called a misguided and unlawful example of regulatory overreach. Under previous Director Rohit Chopra, the CFPB estimated that its rule would save families $10 billion annually. Instead, it inadvertently saddled borrowers with higher rates and fees for receiving paper statements as credit card companies sought to offset the expected revenue hit.

Retail cards hit a record high average interest rate of 30.5% last year, according to a Bankrate survey, and rates have stayed close to those levels this year.

""The companies have made a windfall,"" said David Silberman, a veteran banking attorney who lectures at Yale Law School. ""They didn't think they needed this revenue before except for [the CFPB rule], and they're now keeping it, which is coming directly out of the consumer's pocket.""

Synchrony and Bread both easily topped expectations for first-quarter profit, and analysts covering the companies have raised estimates for what they will earn this year, despite concerns about a looming U.S. economic slowdown."|"Last year, banks quickly raised interest rates to record levels and added new monthly fees on credit cards when a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule threatened a key revenue source for the industry.

Saudi Arabia is deepening its investment in women's professional golf.

The Public Investment Fund, the sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia, announced on Wednesday that it will become the title partner of five events that will take place on the the Ladies European Tour.

Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

As part of this latest deal, the tour will revamp the five events, which will be collectively rebranded as the PIF Global Series. The events take place in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; Seoul, South Korea; London; Houston; and Shenzhen, China.

""PIF continues to be a catalyst for the growth of women's sports, committed to delivering long-term transformative impact by inspiring and empowering female athletes at every level,"" Alanoud Althonayan, head of events and sponsorships at PIF, said in a statement.

The revamped tournament format will feature team and individual competitions happening simultaneously.

The Saudis are also injecting additional money into the prize pools, with a collective purse of $13 million across the five events.

Alexandra Armas, CEO of the Ladies European Tour, said the partnership with PIF has helped raise the level of competition in the women's game and gives players more opportunities to succeed on the world stage.

Saudi Arabia has been aggressively investing in professional sports in recent years as part of its vision to diversify the country's economy away from oil. Despite the fact that Saudi Arabia has been slow to give Saudi women rights, those investments have included spending big money on international women's sports.

Last May, the fund signed a multi-year partnership with the WTA Tour, the women's professional tennis organization, to grow the game and improve women's benefits in the league.

And in March, PIF announced it will fully fund the tour's maternity fund, which would allow women to take up to a year of leave fully paid.

However, PIF's foray into men's golf has been more complicated.

Nearly two years ago, PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan and PIF Governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan appeared on CNBC, announcing a merger between LIV Golf and the PGA Tour. But that deal has yet to happen, despite the latest push by President Donald Trump to bring the two parties together.

EXCLUSIVE: Donald Trump has announced that the UK and the US have reached a 'comprehensive' trade agreement (the US's first of many, he says) but whether or not that deal is good for Brits remains to be seen

Britain is holding its breath as it waits on the result of trade negotiations between the UK and the US.

The UK is expected to become the first country to make a new deal with the United States following President Donald Trump’s far-reaching tariffs last month.

‌



The UK, like the rest of the world, has a base level 10% on all imports, while a number of industry-specific barriers – such as on the car industry – have also been erected.

‌



Latest reports claim a deal has been done, and an announcement is expected at 3pm today (May 8).

Last night, Trump posted on his Truth Social platform: “Big News Conference tomorrow morning at 10:00 A.M., The Oval Office, concerning a MAJOR TRADE DEAL WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF A BIG, AND HIGHLY RESPECTED, COUNTRY. THE FIRST OF MANY!!!”

But what a trade deal could include with the US remains to be seen.

It’s no secret that the UK needs the US in various ways, with a Number 10 spokesperson admitting ahead of the announcement that, “The United States is an indispensable ally for both our economic and national security”.

This then, naturally creates fear Britain could sell out its own preferences in the interest of getting a deal done.

‌



But what does a good deal look like, and what is a worst case scenario?

“The context of this is that Trump has introduced a number of new tariff over the last few months and so the UK is trying to negotiate those tariffs off, said Marley Morris of the Institute for Public Policy Research.

“So, to some extent, we’re trying to get back to where we were before.

‌



“Best case scenario is a removal of all those tariffs, steel, aluminium, cars and the universal baseline tariffs.

Chlorinated chicken has long been a sticking point (stock) (Image: Bloomberg via Getty Images )

“Going even further, trade integration. I think that’s unlikely, I think what we’ll see is steel and aluminium tariffs going out of the talks and it looks like Trump is pretty insistent on maintaining the universal baseline tariffs for everyone. So the talks are likely to focus more on the steel and car tariffs.”

‌



He then laid out what a poor outcome could look like, with things like food and online security potentially on the line.

Morris added: “Worst case scenario would be even those tariffs weren’t removed very much or only reduced slightly.

“And then of course the other question will be what is the UK offering in terms of the negotiations.

‌



“I think we’re expecting something on the digital services tax being reduced, but I think from our perspective a worst case scenario would be the UK crossing red lines.

“For instance compromising our online safety rules or our food safety standards – for instance things like chlorinated chicken or hormone-treated beef. I think that’s unlikely because the government said it has those red lines.

“But I think that’s the worst case scenario – the government compromising those things while going beyond where it originally suggested it would and didn't get much in return.

‌



Trump said the deal was comprehensive (Image: AFP via Getty Images )

“But, I think more likely, we’ll get somewhere in between. I think we’ll probably be sensible, which reduces tariffs on cars and steel and has some compromises on the UK side, for instance lowering the digital services tax.”

Presumably with these fears in mind, MPs have been calling on the government to open any deal to a vote in the commons.

‌



Daisy Cooper, the MP for St Albans, said in a statement: “Parliament must be given a vote on this US trade deal so it can be properly scrutinised.

A good trade deal with the US could bring huge benefits, but Liberal Democrats are deeply concerned that it may include measures that threaten our NHS, undermine our farmers or give tax cuts to US tech billionaires.

If the government is confident the agreement it has negotiated with Trump is in Britain’s national interest, it should not be afraid to bring it before MPs.

The Walt Disney Co. announced Wednesday that it has reached an agreement with immersive destination and experiences company Miral to bring a park and resort to Yas Island in the United Arab Emirates.

This will be Disney's seventh theme park resort and it will be fully developed and built by Miral. Disney's imagineers will lead creative design and operational oversight on the project. The entertainment giant will not be investing capital in the project, but will reap the benefits of royalties.

The development in Abu Dhabi is not part of the $60 billion that Disney has pledged to invest in its theme parks over the next decade.

""This is a thrilling moment for our company as we announce plans to build an exciting Disney theme park resort in Abu Dhabi, whose culture is rich with an appreciation of the arts and creativity,"" said Disney CEO Bob Iger, in a statement. ""As our seventh theme park destination, it will rise from this land in spectacular fashion, blending contemporary architecture with cutting edge technology to offer guests deeply immersive entertainment experiences in unique and modern ways.""

Iger, in an interview with CNBC's David Faber on Wednesday, said imagineers have already begun designing the park. He declined to specify when the company expects the park to open.

""We're not pinning down a date yet,"" he said. ""It typically takes us between 18 months and two years to design and fully develop and approximately five years to build but we're not making any commitments right now.""

The announcement came after Disney reported a top- and bottom-line beat for its fiscal second quarter, with its experiences business — including parks, cruises and resorts as well as consumer products — reporting 6% year-over-year revenue growth.

The segment represented 37% of the company's overall revenue in fiscal 2024 and nearly 60% of its operating income.

""Experiences is obviously a critical business for Disney and also an important growth platform,"" Iger said on Disney's second-quarter earnings conference call. ""Despite questions around any macroeconomic uncertainty or the impact of competition, I'm encouraged by the strength and resilience of our business as evidenced in these earnings and in the second-half bookings at Walt Disney World."""|"A new Disney theme park is coming to Abu Dhabi.

The vehicle program is in crisis.

We reported at the beginning of April that Tesla ended the first quarter of 2025 with at least 2,400 Cybertrucks in new inventory available in the US.

There’s no exact way to track Tesla’s inventory in the US, but there are ways to track Tesla’s Cybertruck listings. Sometimes, Tesla may have many vehicles with the exact same configuration at the same location and it will only publish a single listing for it.

Therefore, Tesla might have been sitting on more Cybertruck inventory.

Advertisement - scroll for more content

A month later, the number of listings in the US has skyrocketed to over 10,000 Cybertrucks, according to Tesla-Info.com:

This surge could be due to an actual net increase in Cybertruck inventory, but Tesla is also heavily discounting the trucks at varying rates, creating several different prices and, therefore, more listings.

At an average sale price of $78,000, Tesla could have almost $800 million worth of Cybertrucks.

Due to low demand, Tesla appears to have significantly slowed down Cybertruck production in recent months. Therefore, this surge is likely more about Tesla discounting the vehicles, exposing the broader US inventory, than an actual major increase in inventory due to more production.

Many of the Cybertrucks in inventory were built in 2024, so they are already at least four months old. Tesla still has ‘Foundation Series’ Cybertrucks in inventory, which it stopped producing in October 2024—more than seven months ago.

Tesla recently launched the Cybertruck RWD, but it has given up on making it with a smaller battery pack and instead removed many important features.

Electrek’s Take

This is about as bad as it gets. Over 10,000 units account for about two quarters of Tesla’s Cybertruck sales.

It already looks like Tesla has slowed Cybertruck production down to a crawl, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it pauses it soon. The hard part for Tesla is to admit defeat.

The Cybertruck RWD using the same battery pack as the AWD was already a sort of admission that Tesla found the vehicle program to be too small to be worth being produced with two battery pack sizes. The automaker did the same with Model S/X when the program’s volumes shrank following the launches of Model 3 and Model Y.

It looks like under the current circumstances, Tesla will have issues selling more than 20,000 Cybertrucks per year in the US despite having planned production for 250,000 units."|"Tesla’s Cybertruck inventory has skyrocketed to a new record high of more than 10,000 units.

The economy could face a no-win dilemma|"The Federal Reserve is holding interest rates steady as it navigates uncertainty kicked up by a president who keeps haranguing the central bank to lower them.

“‘Too Late’ Jerome Powell is a FOOL, who doesn’t have a clue,” President Donald Trump posted on his Truth Social platform Friday morning, renewing a long-running barrage of insults against the central bank chair. “Other than that, I like him very much!” he added.

The president’s public pressure campaign on the Fed comes as the central bank faces an ironic, whiplash-inducing reversal.

Just months ago, it was on the verge of a rare feat — wrestling down a historic run-up of inflation without triggering mass layoffs, known as a “soft landing” — and preparing to keep cutting borrowing costs. But Trump’s rapid upending of global trade has pushed the Fed and its leader into a difficult position, in which they feel a wait-and-see approach may be their best strategy for now.

“The Fed has been plunged into an almost impossible situation whereby its two mandates will likely move in opposite directions,” said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, referring to the Fed’s dual mission of keeping employment high and inflation low.

“But government policy — which is incredibly uncertain itself — will dictate both the timing and magnitudes of those moves,” she wrote in a note to clients Wednesday.

The concern is that an economy damaged by tariffs will force the Fed to cut interest rates to stave off job losses, at the risk of driving inflation higher. After having peaked above 9% in mid-2022, the annual inflation rate has been hovering just north of the central bank’s 2% target for nearly a year.

Powell said Wednesday that holding pat on rates allows the Fed to “wait and see” how the economy unfolds. But policymakers warned in their statement Wednesday that “the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen,” renewing concerns about “stagflation” — a situation in which job losses and price hikes both mount even as the economy lags.

“The tariff shock will reduce real GDP growth and raise prices at the same time, putting the Fed on the horns of a dilemma,” Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings, warned in a note Wednesday afternoon. “The policy move necessary to maintain full employment is the opposite of that necessary to contain inflation. Moving one policy lever to hit two conflicting targets is problematic.”

Politics are adding to the difficulty. Trump has broken long-standing norms against political influence over monetary policy by repeatedly bashing Powell, whom he appointed in 2018. The president’s fresh criticism Friday follows weeks of escalating attacks.

“CUT INTEREST RATES, JEROME, AND STOP PLAYING POLITICS!” he wrote on Truth Social on April 4. Two weeks later, he posted again, nicknaming Powell “Too Late” and saying his “termination cannot come fast enough!” In yet another post a week later, Trump called Powell a “major loser.”

Powell told reporters Wednesday that Trump’s comments had no impact.

“It really doesn’t affect either our job or the way we do it,” he said, adding that neither has he asked for a meeting with Trump nor has the president requested one. President Joe Biden reappointed Powell in 2022, and despite the recent barrage of criticism, Trump told NBC News’ Kristen Welker last week that he wouldn’t seek to remove him before his term ends in May 2026.

“Why would I do that? I get to replace the person in another short period of time,” he said.

The challenges of recent months mark the second time Powell has weighed how to handle economic fallout from Trump’s trade policies. In 2019, Trump was similarly threatening higher duties on China. Powell, who faced similar jabs from Trump through a barrage of Twitter posts at the time, wound up cutting interest rates three times to pre-emptively cushion the U.S. economy from the blow of higher duties.

Powell signaled Wednesday that this time is different. The Fed was less worried in 2019 about the inflationary impacts of lower rates, he indicated, because prices were rising more slowly at a slower pace than they are now. Core personal consumption expenditures, the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, showed prices rising at an annual rate of 2.6% in March, whereas the same measure clocked in beneath 2% for all of 2019.

“It’s not a situation where we can be pre-emptive, because we actually don’t know what the right response to the data will be until we see more data,” Powell said.

Although markets expect the Fed to cut interest rates three times by the end of the year, some analysts aren’t so sure. Bank of America researchers said Wednesday, “If our base case of a steady labor market and rising inflation is correct, we don’t see a path to cuts in 2025.”

In the meantime, Powell has avoided committing to future moves given the widespread uncertainty Trump’s tariffs have generated for corporate bosses, small-business owners and consumers alike.

“There are cases in which it would be appropriate for us to cut rates this year. There are cases in which it wouldn’t,” he told reporters Wednesday. “We just don’t know.”"|"The Federal Reserve is holding interest rates steady as it navigates uncertainty kicked up by a president who keeps haranguing the central bank to lower them.

“If the large increases in tariffs that have been announced are sustained, they’re likely to generate a rise in inflation, a slowdown in economic growth, and an increase in unemployment,” the Federal Reserve chair said on Wednesday. “The effects on inflation could be short-lived, reflecting a one-time shift in the price level.

That amount is $196 billion more than the deficit recorded during the same period last fiscal year. Revenues increased by $146 billion (or 5 percent), and outlays rose by $342 billion (or 9 percent).

The change in the deficit was influenced by the timing of outlays, which decreased the deficit during the first seven months of fiscal year 2024. Outlays in fiscal year 2024 were reduced by shifts in the timing of payments that were due on October 1, 2023, a Sunday. (The payments were made that September.) If not for those shifts, the deficit so far this fiscal year would have been $123 billion more than the shortfall at this point last year. In addition, part of the deficit increase in 2025 arises from the postponement of some tax deadlines from 2023 to 2024 (described below), which boosted receipts in 2024.

In January 2025, CBO projected a deficit of $1.9 trillion for fiscal year 2025, the same as the actual deficit for fiscal year 2024.

Economic data releases and earnings

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell offered investors a consistent message on Wednesday: patience.

Time and again, the chair came back to the idea that the Fed has an ability, and an obligation, to wait and see how developments evolve on tariff policy and any economic distortions that follow.

The first distortion, as the Fed noted in its policy statement, came from export data that dragged down first quarter GDP. Powell also noted survey data reflects considerable uncertainty among businesses and households. And ongoing trade negotiations make the outlook hard to peg too.

""For the time being, we're well-positioned to wait for greater clarity before considering any adjustments to our policy stance,"" Powell said in prepared remarks Wednesday. And as the Fed chair's Q&A evolved, the theme recurred.

But what began as an insistence toward patience eventually announced itself as the outlines of a plan, in the end, not to be preemptive but reactive. Specifically, the central bank will wait and see if things get worse in the US economy. And only then will it be compelled to move.

Back in 2019, Powell noted the economy showed some signs of weakening and, with inflation running below the Fed's 2% target, the central bank cut rates three times to stave off a further slowdown. Before the pandemic rocked the global economy, the Fed and markets enjoyed what some called one of the ""easiest years ever for investors.""

In 2025, the central bank is in no such situation.

Today, inflation is running above the Fed's 2% target. The prospect of tariffs likely lifts inflation — even if temporarily — further away from that goal. Powell also acknowledged that some are making forecasts for a weakening economy, even a recession.

""My gut tells me that uncertainty about the path of the economy is extremely elevated, and that the downside risks have increased,"" Powell said during his press conference.

In its policy statement, the central bank noted that since March, ""Uncertainty about the economic outlook has increased further."" It added, ""The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen.""

Still, attentiveness does not create an ability to anticipate.

""In any case, [the current economy is] not a situation where we can be preemptive because we actually don't know what the right response to the data will be until we see more data,"" Powell said."|"The first distortion, as the Fed noted in its policy statement, came from export data that dragged down first quarter GDP.

Keir Starmer signed off the deal after a week of intensive talks by officials in Washington

The US trade deal may not be as “full and comprehensive” as Donald Trump said on Truth Social last night – but Keir Starmer looks to have secured a solid agreement for Britain.

The UK and US have agreed terms on a landmark deal which could save British jobs, The i Paper revealed earlier today.

Trade experts will now pore over the details.

The Prime Minister signed off the deal late on Wednesday after a week of intensive talks between negotiators concluded in Washington DC.

The terms were announced by the US President at 3pm UK time, and will see an end to the 25 per cent tariff on steel and cars. It is a boost to the UK auto industry, which was worth about £9bn last year.

Car export tariffs will reduce from 27.5 per cent to 10 per cent, for a quota of 100,000 UK cars, almost the total the UK exported last year, while steel tariffs will be reduced to zero.

Negotiations on reducing the US-imposed 10 per cent tariffs across all sectors are expected to be continued in the near future.

And the UK will not lower its 2 per cent digital services tax on US firms owned by billionaires like Trump aide Elon Musk – in another win for Starmer.

British farmers are likely to be pleased by the fact that there has been no UK concession on food standards imported from the US in the deal – but there may still be jitters over what the future holds.

Many American farmers use growth hormones as a standard part of their beef production, something that was banned in Britain and the EU in the 1980s.

But there will only be reciprocal arrangements on high-quality beef, The i Paper understands, and no concessions at all on sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) arrangements such as the import of chlorinated chickens.

The US said Britain has agreed to take agricultural machinery and products to put £5bn into UK markets.

The UK is also understood to have had assurances of preferential treatment on pharmaceutical exports although the US has not imposed tariffs on drugs yet.

The UK’s second-largest export to the US is pharmaceuticals, with sales reaching £6.6bn last year.

Trump said in a post on Truth Social: “This should be a very big and exciting day” for the US and UK.

He also said that the deal was “full and comprehensive,” and would “cement the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom for many years to come”.

But this isn’t a major trade deal because the US President does not have the authority to sign off on the type of free-trade agreement which India and the UK finalised earlier this week.

That power lies with Congress which would need to approve a trade agreement, which would take longer than the 90-day pause in place on Trump’s tariffs."|"The UK and US have agreed terms on a landmark deal which could save British jobs, The i Paper revealed earlier today.

In a post on Truth Social, U.S. President Donald Trump said Thursday, ""The agreement with the United Kingdom is a full and comprehensive one that will cement the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom for many years to come.""

Britain, which runs a trade deficit with the U.S., was spared the higher reciprocal tariffs when Trump announced his ""liberation day"" duties, although it was still hit with the baseline 10% levy. It is also subject to the U.S.' 25% duties on steel, aluminum and vehicles, which early reports suggest may play a key role in the deal to be announced Thursday.

The decision came after the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday held rates steady, noting that risks to both higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump agreed Thursday to cut tariffs on U.K. autos, steel and aluminum in a planned trade deal but played down the possibility of other nations getting similarly favorable terms on his import taxes, which are roiling the global economy.

Under the framework agreement, the United Kingdom is to buy more American beef and ethanol and streamline its customs process for goods from the United States. But Trump’s baseline 10% tariffs against British goods are to stay in place, and the Republican president suggested that even higher import taxes would be charged on other countries trying to reach deals with the U.S.

“That’s a low number,” Trump said of the U.K.'s 10% tariff rate, adding that other countries would face higher tariff rates in their deals because the U.S. runs trade deficits with them and “in many cases they didn’t treat us right.”

The announcement provided a political victory for U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and offered a degree of validation for Trump’s claims that his turbulent approach on trade may be able to rebalance the global economy on his preferred terms. While the deal should improve Britain’s situation relative to when Trump began imposing new tariffs, the world economy is still mired in the confusion and uncertainty unleashed by the president’s import taxes. The deal with the U.K. would be a resonant but small step toward greater clarity given that Britain represents a fraction of U.S. imports.

The U.S. president talked up the framework to reporters in the Oval Office, although the fine print remains in flux.

“In the coming weeks, we’ll have it all very conclusive,” Trump said.

The president said the agreement would lead to more beef and ethanol exports to the U.K., and streamline the processing of U.S. goods through customs. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the baseline 10% tariffs would stay in place and said an unspecified British company would be announcing the purchase of $10 billion in aircraft from Boeing.

AP AUDIO: Trump agrees to cut tariffs on UK autos, steel and aluminum in a planned trade deal with Britain AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports on the outlines of a trade deal with the United Kingdom.

Cars, steel and olive oil

U.K. officials said Trump’s auto tariffs would go from 27.5% to 10% on a quota of 100,000 vehicles and the import taxes on steel and aluminum would go from 25% to zero. Starmer said Britain would preserve its health and safety standards on food products.

The U.K. government also said it would also reduce tariffs on 2,500 U.S. products such as olive oil, wine and sports equipment, bringing down the average tariff rate 1.8%.

Starmer, speaking over the phone to Trump while reporters listened in, stressed the importance of the relationship between the two countries as the anniversary of the Allies’ World War II victory in Europe was being commemorated.

“To be able to announce this great deal, on the same day 80 years forward, almost at the same hour,” Starmer said, “I think is incredibly important and makes this truly historic.”

Starmer later spoke to workers at a Jaguar Land Rover plant and promoted the deal, which he said would protect thousands of auto jobs. He told the workers that “this is just the start,” saying “we are hammering out further details to reduce barriers to trade with the United States and across the world.”

While celebrating the planned deal, Trump talked up the U.S. economy’s future despite worrisome signs of a possible slowdown and increase in inflation that could hurt most Americans’ financial well-being and lead to layoffs.

The president said the public should buy into the stock market because the U.S. was about to go up like a “rocket ship,” even as he dismissed reports of fewer container ships docking in the U.S. and companies warning of price increases if the tariffs remain.

Trump said that fewer container ships arriving from China meant “we lose less money” from the trade deficit, even though the goods in those ships are used by U.S. manufacturers and sold by retailers in ways that can support jobs while holding down prices.

Asked about companies saying they would need to raise prices because of the tariffs, Trump said, “I think they’re saying that just to try and negotiate deals with me.” Trump suggested that he might put 100% tariffs on Mattel toys if they don’t relocate their factories to the United States.

Trump has maintained that there is “virtually” no inflation. The Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure has increased at 2.3% annually, slightly higher than the central bank’s 2% target.

The U.S. president on Thursday said that Fed Chair Jerome Powell should cut the Fed’s benchmark interest rates that are designed to manage inflation, saying that Powell was holding the Fed’s rates at current levels instead of slashing them because “he’s not in love with me.” Powell warned at a Wednesday news conference that the tariffs were creating uncertainty and the Fed could afford to wait until more data shows the impacts on the economy.

Looking for a deal since Brexit

The U.S. already runs a trade surplus with the U.K., making it a bit easier to find common ground at a time when Trump has staked his tariffs on eliminating the annual trade deficits with multiple nations he says have taken advantage of the U.S.

A British government official, insisting on anonymity to discuss the talks, said the U.K. planned to seek greater trade liberalization as negotiations continue, such that the effective tariff rate charged by the U.S. could be lower than the 10% baseline.

The official said the talks have been built on the longstanding closeness between the two nations and, when in discussions with the Trump administration, the key was to be charming and know how to say “no” nicely.

The official said Trump had invited the British government to agree to a trade deal before April 2, but the president changed his mind so that he could impose his sweeping “Liberation Day” tariffs. That statement indicates that Trump could have announced some form of Thursday’s agreement weeks earlier.

No new deals have been reached with the United States’ largest trading partners, including Canada, Mexico and China. Trump has left the highest tariffs in place on China, sparking a confrontation between the world’s two biggest economies. Washington and Beijing are sending officials to Switzerland this weekend for an initial round of trade talks.

Trump said Thursday that he “could” lower the 145% rate charged on Chinese goods if the weekend talks go well.

“Right now, you can’t get any higher,” Trump said. “It’s at 145, so we know it’s coming down.”

The U.S. and the U.K. have been aiming to strike a bilateral trade agreement since the British people voted in 2016 to leave the European Union, allowing the country to negotiate independently of the rest of the continent. Then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson touted a future deal with the U.S. as an incentive for Brexit.

Negotiations started in 2020, during Trump’s first term. But the talks made little progress under President Joe Biden, a Democrat and a critic of Brexit. Negotiations resumed after Trump returned to office in January and intensified in recent weeks.

The U.S. ran a $11.9 billion trade surplus in goods with the U.K. last year, according to the Census Bureau. The $68 billion in goods that the U.S. imported from the U.K. last year accounted for just 2% of all goods imported into the country.

The U.S. is far more important for the U.K. economy. It was Britain’s biggest trading partner last year, according to government statistics, though the bulk of Britain’s exports to the U.S. are services rather than goods.

Cue linked the dip in searches to the growing use of AI, which the company is now considering putting into Safari. The rise of web search in AI tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and Microsoft Copilot may make users less inclined to visit Google as their primary way of finding information.

Google currently pays Apple around $20 billion to make its search engine the default in Safari, and a decrease in searches could mean less money for Apple. “I’ve lost a lot of sleep thinking about it,” Cue said, when considering what Apple would do without revenue from Google Search.

In a statement published on Wednesday, Google said it continues to “see overall query growth in Search,” including on “Apple’s devices and platforms” — but it doesn’t single out Safari. “More generally, as we enhance Search with new features, people are seeing that Google Search is more useful for more of their queries — and they’re accessing it for new things and in new ways, whether from browsers or the Google app, using their voice or Google Lens,” the company said.

24|r/Economics|2025-05-08 23:11:40|https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250416889571/en/Bankruptcy-Inquiries-Hit-Pandemic-Era-Highs-Warning-of-Summer-Surge|Bankruptcy Inquiries Hit Pandemic-Era Highs, Warning of Summer Surge|"ADA, Okla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Bankruptcy inquiries surged in the first quarter to their highest level since early 2020, signaling a potential summer wave of filings, LegalShield reported today. The legal service provider's data, historically a leading indicator of bankruptcy and other consumer financial trends, suggests record consumer debt and new tariffs could push financially strained households past their breaking point.

""Bankruptcy inquiries hit the highest we've seen since early 2020, just before Americans' checkbooks were boosted by COVID checks from the government,"" said Matt Layton, LegalShield senior vice president of consumer analytics. ""When you combine record debt, rising delinquencies, and prolonged financial stress, topped by price pressures driven by tariff uncertainty, the risk of a summer surge in bankruptcy filings becomes very real.""

Historically LegalShield’s Bankruptcy Index is a leading indicator of actual bankruptcy filings by two quarters.

The bankruptcy warning signs come amid a third straight quarter of elevated consumer stress measured by LegalShield’s Consumer Stress Legal Index (CSLI), pointing to a heightened financial strain that has become a ""new normal"" for American households.

The CSLI has remained elevated since a spike in July of 2024, leveling off slightly to close Q1 2025 at 65.3, down from 67.3 at the end of 2024. The decline was driven by a significant drop in consumer finance inquiries amidst tax refund season and relatively strong employment numbers, which may be masking greater concerns as bankruptcy and foreclosure inquiries increased before tariff announcements sent the markets into turmoil.

Why it matters: The CSLI, based on over 35 million legal service requests from LegalShield members, offers a unique, real-time view into American households’ financial well-being.

Many American households may be poised for a breaking point in the first half of 2025 as they deal with new tariffs, rising prices, increased debt and sustained elevated interest rates. U.S. bankruptcy filings surged 14.2% year-over-year by the end of 2024, according to the U.S. Courts, and LegalShield data indicates filings may continue to rise.

Key Findings:

1. Bankruptcy Risk Rising Quickly

Index: 36.4 (up from 33.3 in Q4; 30.0 in Q1 2024)

Insight: Consumers are buried by record debt. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported that the share of households 90+ days late on credit cards and car loans hit a 14-year high at the end of 2024, and delinquencies are still climbing. Credit card balances hit a record high of $1.21 trillion.

2. Mortgage Pressure Intensifying

Foreclosure Index: 41.3 (up from 40.1 in Q4; 36.2 in Q1 2024)

Insight: Elevated mortgage rates and affordability constraints are stressing homeowners and freezing inventory.

3. Consumer Finance Concerns Ease—For Now

Consumer Finance Index: 97.9 (down from 108.5 in Q4; 99.7 in Q1 2024)

Insight: Tax refunds and strong job growth gave consumers a temporary cushion—but risks remain as tariff-driven price increases are expected.

4. Housing Market Signals Softness

Housing Construction Index: 114.1 (down from 118.4 in Q4; 115.3 YoY)

(down from 118.4 in Q4; 115.3 YoY) Housing Sales Index: 94.1 (down from 97.9 in Q4; slightly up from 92.3 YoY)

Insight: Higher material costs driven by tariffs and elevated mortgage rates are dampening both buyer interest and builder activity. Housing starts are a leading indicator of broader economic activity. Reduced residential construction not only limits future housing supply, putting upward pressure on home prices, but also weakens associated industries like construction materials, labor markets, and durable goods.

What is the CSLI: The CSLI tracks approximately 150,000 calls per month from everyday Americans seeking legal help, comprising a dataset of more than 35 million consumer requests since 2002. The index is built on three subindices tracking calls for legal assistance for issues related to Bankruptcy, Foreclosure and Consumer Finance, which measures inquiries regarding a variety of consumer financial concerns such as billing disputes, debt issues and loan modifications.

(All quarterly percent changes in this release are seasonally adjusted annualized rates.) This is the first decline in nonfarm business sector labor productivity since the second quarter of 2022. From the same quarter a year ago, nonfarm business sector labor productivity increased 1.4 percent in the first quarter of 2025. (See tables A1 and 2.) Unit labor costs in the nonfarm business sector increased 5.7 percent in the first quarter of 2025, reflecting a 4.8-percent increase in hourly compensation and a 0.8-percent decrease in productivity. Unit labor costs increased 1.3 percent over the last four quarters. (See tables A1 and 2.) BLS calculates unit labor costs as the ratio of hourly compensation to labor productivity. Increases in hourly compensation tend to increase unit labor costs and increases in productivity tend to reduce them. Real hourly compensation, which takes into account consumer prices, increased 1.0 percent in the first quarter of 2025, and was unchanged over the last four quarters. Labor productivity, or output per hour, is calculated by dividing an index of real output by an index of hours worked by all workers, including employees, proprietors, and unpaid family workers. During the current business cycle, starting in the fourth quarter of 2019, labor productivity has grown at an annualized rate of 1.8 percent, reflecting a 2.4-percent rate of growth in output and a 0.6-percent rate of growth in hours worked. The 1.8-percent annualized rate of productivity growth in the current business cycle thus far is higher than the 1.5-percent rate of the previous business cycle from the fourth quarter of 2007 through the fourth quarter of 2019, and is below the long-term rate of 2.1 percent since the first quarter of 1947. Manufacturing sector labor productivity increased 4.5 percent in the first quarter of 2025, as output increased 5.1 percent and hours worked increased 0.5 percent. The increase in productivity is the steepest since the second quarter of 2021, when the measure increased 5.3 percent. In the durable manufacturing sector, productivity increased 7.1 percent, reflecting a 7.9-percent increase in output and a 0.8-percent increase in hours worked. Nondurable manufacturing sector productivity increased 2.2 percent, as output increased 2.3 percent and hours worked increased 0.1 percent. Total manufacturing sector productivity increased 1.5 percent from the same quarter a year ago. (See tables A1, 3, 4, and 5.) Unit labor costs in the total manufacturing sector increased 1.6 percent in the first quarter of 2025, reflecting a 6.2-percent increase in hourly compensation and a 4.5-percent increase in productivity. Manufacturing unit labor costs increased 0.7 percent from the same quarter a year ago. (See tables A1 and 3.) Manufacturing sector labor productivity has grown at an annualized rate of 0.5 percent during the current business cycle, as output has increased 0.2 percent and hours have declined 0.3 percent. The 0.5- percent annualized rate of productivity growth in the current business cycle thus far is above the 0.1- percent rate of the previous business cycle from the fourth quarter of 2007 through the fourth quarter of 2019 and is below the long-term rate of 2.1 percent since the first quarter of 1987. The 4.5 percent increase in labor productivity in the first quarter of 2025 boosted the annualized growth rate for the current business cycle 0.2 percentage point, from 0.3 percent to 0.5 percent. The concepts, sources, and methods used for the manufacturing output series differ from those used in the business and nonfarm business output series; these output measures are not directly comparable. See the Technical Notes for a more detailed explanation. Preliminary fourth-quarter and annual 2024 measures were announced today for the nonfinancial corporate sector. Productivity increased 4.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2024, as output increased 5.4 percent and hours worked increased 0.4 percent. From the fourth quarter of 2023 to the fourth quarter of 2024, nonfinancial corporate sector productivity increased 3.7 percent. Revised measures Hours and related measures--including labor productivity and hourly compensation--for all sectors were revised to incorporate updated ratios of hours worked to hours paid by detailed industry, provided by the BLS National Compensation Survey; indexes were subject to revision back to 2018. Measures of real hourly compensation for all sectors were also subject to revision from 2020 onward due to the incorporation of the revised Consumer Price Index Retroactive Series. Fourth quarter and annual average data for 2024 were revised to incorporate regular updates of source data on output and compensation published by the Department of Commerce on March 27, 2025. Manufacturing sector output for the third and fourth quarters of 2024 reflects revisions published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System on March 18 and April 16, 2025. Table B1 presents previous and revised productivity and related measures for the business, nonfarm business, and manufacturing sectors for the fourth quarter of 2024. In the fourth quarter of 2024, nonfarm business sector productivity was revised up 0.2 percentage point to an increase of 1.7 percent, reflecting a 0.1-percentage point upward revision to output; hours worked were not revised. Nonfarm business unit labor costs were revised down 0.2 percentage point to an increase of 2.0 percent, reflecting a 0.1-percentage point downward revision to hourly compensation and the aforementioned 0.2-percentage point upward revision to labor productivity. In the manufacturing sector, productivity, output, and hours worked for the fourth quarter of 2024 were not revised. Unit labor costs were revised up 0.1 percentage point to an increase of 3.8 percent. Although many measures were not revised for the manufacturing sector, the constituent durable and nondurable manufacturing sectors saw offsetting revisions. Labor productivity was revised down 0.6 percentage point in the durable manufacturing sector and up 0.6 percentage point in the nondurable manufacturing sector. Output was revised down 0.4 percentage point in the durable manufacturing sector and up 0.5 percentage point in the nondurable manufacturing sector. Hours worked were revised up 0.1 percentage point in the durable manufacturing sector and down 0.1 percentage point in the nondurable manufacturing sector. Lastly, unit labor costs were revised up 0.7 percentage point in the durable manufacturing sector and down 0.6 percentage point in the nondurable manufacturing sector (See table B1.) The annual average rate of productivity growth in the nonfarm business sector in 2024 was revised up 0.1-percentage point to an increase of 2.8 percent; annual average productivity for the manufacturing sector was not revised. (See tables 2 and 3.) Quarterly and annual data for all sectors from 2023 forward appear in tables 1-6.

Ukraine is considering moving away from the U.S. dollar and closer to the euro as a benchmark for the hryvnia, Reuters reported on May 7, citing National Bank Governor Andrii Pyshnyi.

Threats of wide-ranging tariffs by U.S. President Donald Trump have shocked markets and drawn criticism worldwide. Meanwhile, Ukraine is moving closer to the EU as it undergoes accession negotiations with the bloc.

The ""strengthening of the EU's role in ensuring our defense capabilities, greater volatility in global markets, and the probability of global trade fragmentation,"" are all reasons Ukraine is considering the euro over the dollar, Pyshnyi said.

Some European countries that do not use the euro, including Denmark, peg their currencies to the euro using the European exchange rate mechanism as part of the EU's Economic and Monetary Union.

""This work is complex and requires high-quality, versatile preparation,"" Pyshnyi told Reuters.

On April 9, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Ukraine has fulfilled 81% of its commitments made under the Association Agreement with the European Union.

""Once again, we are demonstrating that we are able to make our way to EU membership quickly and efficiently. This year, we aim to open all six clusters in the EU accession negotiations and deepen sectoral integration,"" he said.

The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on Wednesday, just weeks after President Donald Trump intensified calls for lower borrowing costs and voiced eagerness about the potential ""termination"" of Fed Chair Jerome Powell.

In recent days, Trump has dialed back his attacks on Powell, saying he will not fire Powell before the end of the top central banker's term next year. Trump has reiterated his displeasure with the level of interest rates, however, urging the central bank to lower them.

Speaking at a press conference in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, Powell said the economy remains in ""solid shape"" but warned Trump's tariff policy could cause higher inflation and an economic slowdown.

""If the large increase in tariffs that have been announced are sustained, they're likely to generate a rise in inflation and a slowdown of economic growth,"" Powell said Wednesday.

""All of these policies are evolving, however, and their effects on the economy remain highly uncertain,"" Powell added.

When asked about Trump's call for lower rates, Powell shrugged off criticism from the president.

""It doesn’t affect our doing our job at all,"" Powell said. ""We’re always going to consider only the economic data, the outlook, the balance of risks – and that’s it.""

The move marked the Fed's second consecutive decision to maintain the current level of interest rates, repeating an approach taken in January. Before that, the Fed had cut rates at three consecutive meetings.

""For now, it does seem like a fairly clear decision for us to wait and see,"" Powell said.

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), a policymaking body at the Fed, said Wednesday that key economic indicators had improved but it cautioned of heightened economic uncertainty.

""Risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen,"" the FOMC said in a statement.

Last month, Powell raised the possibility that Trump's tariffs may cause what economists call ""stagflation,"" which is when inflation rises and the economy slows.

If the Fed raises interest rates as a means of protecting against tariff-induced inflation under such a scenario, it risks stifling borrowing and slowing the economy further. On the other hand, if the Fed lowers rates to stimulate the economy in the face of a potential slowdown, it threatens to boost spending and worsen inflation.

Still, Powell pointed to solid economic performance as a reason to take a patient approach as policymakers await the impact of tariffs.

""For the time being, we are well-positioned to wait for greater clarity,"" Powell told an audience at the Economic Club of Chicago.

Powell noted the possibility of a shift in economic conditions, saying, ""Life moves pretty fast.""

The rate decision arrives days after fresh data showed robust job growth in April.

Despite flagging consumer sentiment and market turmoil, the labor market has provided a bright spot since Trump took office. Meanwhile, inflation cooled in March, the most recent month for which data is available.

Even so, recession fears are mounting on Wall Street as Trump's tariffs threaten to upend global trade. Goldman Sachs earlier this month hiked its odds of a recession from 35% to 45%. JPMorgan pegged the probability of a recession this year at 60%.

A government report last week showed the U.S. economy shrank over the first three months of 2025, much of which took place as Trump's flurry of tariff proposals stoked uncertainty among businesses and consumers.

U.S. gross domestic product, or GDP, declined at a 0.3% annualized rate over three months ending in March, according to government data released on Wednesday. The figure marked a sharp dropoff from 2.4% annualized growth over the final three months of 2024.

The rate decision on Wednesday also marks the first adjustment of borrowing costs since Trump's closely watched ""Liberation Day"" tariff announcement on April 2, which triggered the biggest single-day stock market drop since the COVID-19 pandemic.

Days later, Trump suspended a major swathe of the tariffs, sending the market to one of its largest ever single-day increases. A simultaneous escalation of tariffs on Chinese goods kept the effective tariff rate at its highest level in more than a century, the Yale Budget Lab found.

The White House is seeking to strike trade agreements with dozens of U.S. trade partners before the 90-day suspension of so-called ""reciprocal tariffs"" expires in July.

Port officials said traffic is down nearly half at the two Southern California ports, signaling that there are fewer products now in LA from China and that there will be fewer jobs.

“We are at a point of inflection. It’s kind of dire,” Mario Cordero, port of Long Beach CEO said Monday. “What happens here is going to be an indication of what's going to occur in the supply chain. We have less vessel calls, less cargo now.”

The port of Long Beach is already reporting a huge drop in traffic this week with 34 canceled sailings from ocean carriers to Long Beach. The neighboring port of Los Angeles is also seeing 36 cancelations.

Things have not been this slow since the coronavirus pandemic, Cordero said.

“Covid gave us an insight of what happens when the cargo stops. We certainly don’t want to repeat that scenario again,” he added.

The two ports, which moved 20 million containers last year, are showing a 44% drop in docked vessels in the week of May 4 compared to last year.

“Every four containers means a job, so when we start dialing back, it means less job opportunity,” Gene Seroka, port of LA CEO, told Bloomberg News Sunday, predicting a sharp decline in dock work for employees, no more overtime or double time and potentially less than 40 hours of work a week.

“Less containers, less jobs, less business for truckers,” Cordero echoed the dire projection.

Trucker drivers in Southern California expressed their concerns in case work dries up.

“It definitely brings uncertainty for everybody because we don’t know what’s going to happen, “ a driver named Helen said. “Definitely a lot of people are going to start losing their jobs. They are going to start to be laid off.”

Fewer truck drivers and dock workers mean less business for shops and stores that support them, including Berth 55, a seafood deli, nearby.

Rafeal Arias Anaya, who works at the fish market, said he is seeing fewer truckers coming in for lunch, which leads him to worry that he, too, will be forced to cut back work.

“There’s no win situation with the kind of tariffs we are seeing,” Cordero said, alerting consumers that they will soon feel the trickled-down impact soon.

“For the consumer, we are jeopardizing having products on the shelves in the next couple of months.”

Even if the Trump administration reaches a deal with China or other foreign nations, it’s still going to take about a month to get things back on track."|"As the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach this week begin to feel the impact of tariffs imposed on foreign goods by the Trump administration, a reduction in traffic and cargo was visible at the busiest ports in the U.S. on Monday.

32|r/Economics|2025-05-08 19:05:02|https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy-summary-and-minutes/2025/may-2025|The Bank of England cuts the Bank Rate by 25 bps to 4.25%|"Based on the Committee’s evolving view of the medium-term outlook for inflation, a gradual and careful approach to the further withdrawal of monetary policy restraint remains appropriate. The Committee will continue to monitor closely the risks of inflation persistence and what the evidence may reveal about the balance between aggregate supply and demand in the economy. Monetary policy will need to continue to remain restrictive for sufficiently long until the risks to inflation returning sustainably to the 2% target in the medium term have dissipated further. The Committee will decide the appropriate degree of monetary policy restrictiveness at each meeting.

At this meeting, the Committee voted to reduce Bank Rate to 4.25%, reflecting continued progress in disinflation though with risks to inflation remaining in both directions.

Monetary policy is not on a pre-set path. The Committee will remain sensitive to heightened unpredictability in the economic environment and will continue to update its assessment of risks.

The May Report sets out two illustrative scenarios. In one scenario, there could be weaker supply and more persistence in domestic wages and prices, including from second-round effects related to the near-term increase in CPI inflation. In another scenario, inflationary pressures could ease more quickly owing to greater or longer-lasting weakness in demand relative to supply, in part reflecting uncertainties globally and domestically.

The Committee remains focused on returning CPI inflation sustainably to target in the medium term. In deciding the appropriate degree and pace of monetary policy adjustments required to achieve this, the Committee has considered a range of possibilities for how domestic inflationary pressures could evolve, as well as the broader circumstances that could necessitate varying the course of policy.

Uncertainty surrounding global trade policies has intensified since the imposition of tariffs by the United States and the measures taken in response by some of its trading partners. There has subsequently been volatility in financial markets, and market-implied policy rates have moved lower. Prospects for global growth have weakened as a result of this uncertainty and new tariff announcements, although the negative impacts on UK growth and inflation are likely to be smaller.

Progress on disinflation in domestic price and wage pressures is generally continuing. Twelve-month CPI inflation fell to 2.6% in March from 2.8% in February, close to expectations in the February Monetary Policy Report. Although indicators of pay growth remain elevated, a significant slowing is still expected over the rest of the year. Wholesale energy prices have fallen back since the February Report. Previous increases in energy prices are still likely to drive up CPI inflation from April onwards, to 3.5% for 2025 Q3. Inflation is expected to fall back thereafter. Measures of household inflation expectations have risen recently.

Underlying UK GDP growth is judged to have slowed since the middle of 2024, and the labour market has continued to loosen.

There has been substantial progress on disinflation over the past two years, as previous external shocks have receded, and as the restrictive stance of monetary policy has curbed second-round effects and stabilised longer-term inflation expectations. That progress has allowed the MPC to withdraw gradually some degree of policy restraint, while maintaining Bank Rate in restrictive territory so as to continue to squeeze out persistent inflationary pressures.

At its meeting ending on 7 May 2025, the MPC voted by a majority of 5–4 to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 4.25%. Two members preferred to reduce Bank Rate by 0.5 percentage points, to 4%. Two members preferred to maintain Bank Rate at 4.5%.

The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. The MPC adopts a medium-term and forward-looking approach to determine the monetary stance required to achieve the inflation target sustainably.

Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 7 May 2025

1: Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed: the international economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; and supply, costs and prices. The latest data on these topics were set out in the accompanying May 2025 Monetary Policy Report.

2: The Committee discussed recent global economic developments, and in particular the likely impact on the outlook for UK inflation of the various changes to trade tariffs that had recently been announced by the United States and some of its trading partners. These potential impacts were discussed in more detail in Box C of the May Report.

3: These trade policy developments were likely to reduce UK activity, and to create further risks to the downside. The impact on UK inflation was more ambiguous at this stage. The baseline expectation was that these developments would push down slightly on inflation over the forecast period. There were material risks on both sides around this judgement, however, including from: weaker global demand; the degree of diversion of exports to non-US markets; how closely the pass-through from global export prices to domestic consumer prices matched previous experience; the level of disruption to supply chains; the extent of further tariff policy announcements; and the risk of broader fragmentation of the global economy and financial system. The Committee would monitor the relevant indicators closely, and would continue to use multiple analytical approaches to evaluate the impact of these developments.

4: Financial markets had been volatile globally following the trade policy announcements in early April, as set out in the May Report. Almost all respondents to the Bank’s latest Market Participants Survey (MaPS) were expecting a 25 basis point reduction in Bank Rate at this MPC meeting, in line with market pricing. Since the MPC's previous meeting the median MaPS respondent expected 75 basis points of further Bank Rate cuts this year, although the overall distribution was now skewed towards more cuts. This was consistent with the market-implied path declining by just under 100 basis points over the rest of the year.

5: The Committee discussed the extent to which movements in UK markets had reflected international factors. International considerations had clearly been the most prominent influence during this period, although, given the US-specific nature of the tariff policy announcements, it was not surprising that the previously close relation between US and UK markets had weakened appreciably in recent weeks. MaPS respondents reported that international factors had generally pushed down on the prospects for activity and inflation, and therefore on near-term UK policy rate expectations, partly offset by the upward impact of domestic factors on inflation.

6: Monthly GDP growth in February had been much stronger than expected, at 0.5%, and Bank staff now estimated that headline GDP growth in 2025 Q1 had been 0.6%. But this news had been accounted for largely by erratic factors, for instance those that had affected output in the manufacturing sector. Bank staff estimated that underlying growth in Q1 had been around zero. Headline GDP growth was projected to slow sharply in Q2, to 0.1%, with risks to the downside, given the signal from high-frequency data. The S&P Global UK composite output PMI had fallen sharply in April, although it remained unclear how much of this decline stemmed from a potentially reversible deterioration in business sentiment.

7: The Committee discussed the extent to which developments in activity had reflected underlying demand and supply drivers, acknowledging that both were likely to have played a role. In the baseline forecast, a margin of slack was expected to continue to open up over the coming years, sufficient to remove remaining excess inflation persistence. Conditioned on the market-implied path for Bank Rate, monetary policy was expected to continue to restrain aggregate demand, while fiscal consolidation was expected to play a greater role in the latter part of the forecast. Potential productivity growth was also expected to pick up. The balance of risks around the baseline forecast for GDP growth was judged to be somewhat to the downside.

8: Twelve-month CPI inflation had fallen to 2.6% in March. The latest evidence from key indicators suggested that progress on underlying disinflation in domestic prices and wages had generally continued, supported by the restrictiveness of monetary policy.

9: The Committee discussed the outlook for a range of nominal indicators. Private sector regular pay growth was expected to slow significantly further by the end of 2025, to around 3¾%, consistent with the latest indications from the Bank’s Agents’ contacts, and from the DMP Survey. That said, survey measures of household inflation expectations had risen further in recent months, perhaps suggesting that households had become more sensitive to inflationary pressures, having recently experienced very high rates of inflation in 2022. Businesses’ medium-term CPI inflation expectations had increased slightly recently, although indicators of medium-term inflation expectations derived from financial markets had generally continued to trend downwards.

10: CPI inflation was expected to rise to a peak of 3.5% on average in 2025 Q3, in large part reflecting developments in household energy bills and, to a lesser degree, regulated prices. This projected increase in headline inflation was still expected to be temporary. The Committee recognised the risk that this projected increase in headline inflation, along with the current trajectory of household inflation expectations, might pose additional risks to persistence if non-linearities were to emerge beyond specific inflation thresholds.

The immediate policy decision

11: The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. The MPC adopts a medium-term and forward-looking approach to determine the monetary stance required to achieve the inflation target sustainably.

12: Underlying UK GDP growth was judged to have slowed since the middle of 2024, and the labour market had continued to loosen.

13: Progress on disinflation in domestic price and wage pressures had generally continued. Twelve-month CPI inflation was 2.6% in March, close to expectations in the February Monetary Policy Report. Although indicators of pay growth had remained elevated, a significant slowing was still expected over the rest of the year. Wholesale energy prices had fallen back since the February Report. Previous increases in energy prices were still likely to drive up CPI inflation from April onwards, to 3.5% on average in 2025 Q3. Inflation was expected to fall back thereafter.

14: Uncertainty surrounding global trade policies had intensified since the imposition of tariffs by the United States and the measures taken in response by some of its trading partners. There had subsequently been volatility in financial markets, and market-implied policy rates had moved lower. Prospects for global growth had weakened as a result of this uncertainty and new tariff announcements, although the negative impacts on UK growth and inflation were likely to be smaller.

15: The Committee remained focused on returning inflation sustainably to the target. In the baseline forecast set out in the May Monetary Policy Report, inflation was expected to return to around the 2% target in the medium term. Overall, the Committee judged that the risks around GDP growth in the baseline forecast were somewhat to the downside, while the risks around the CPI projection were two-sided.

16: In reaching its judgement, and against a backdrop of increased uncertainty, the Committee had been assessing a wide range of risks around the baseline forecast, from both domestic and global factors. The May Monetary Policy Report set out two illustrative scenarios from a much broader set of plausible paths the economy could take. These were intended to explore different economic mechanisms, to which members attached different weights.

17: In the first scenario, greater or longer-lasting weakness in demand relative to supply, in part reflecting uncertainties globally and domestically, might further mitigate inflationary pressures over the medium term. Underlying GDP growth had been weak, and global trade policy uncertainty had risen sharply, which was likely to weigh on household consumption and business investment. It was possible in this environment of uncertainty that precautionary saving could rise and consumption could weaken.

18: In the second scenario, greater persistence in domestic wage- and price-setting, both from additional second-round effects related to the near-term increase in headline CPI inflation and from weaker aggregate supply, might exacerbate the persistence of inflation. Underlying services consumer price inflation and indicators of wage growth had been moderating, but remained at elevated levels. There was evidence that the near-term inflation expectations of firms and households had recently become more reactive to changes in current CPI inflation than they had been pre-Covid. In addition, there were upside risks to inflation stemming from softer growth in potential productivity.

19: More broadly, there were growing risks from potential global trade arrangements. Depending on how trade policies unfolded, UK inflation could be affected by a wide range of factors such as shifts in trade patterns, supply chain disruptions in the UK and abroad, and movements in global exchange rates. It was possible that the ultimate net effect of these developments could be materially more disinflationary for the UK than in the baseline forecast, but it was also possible that the effect could be slightly inflationary in the longer term. Overall, it was too early to conclude over what period and to what degree different economic effects could materialise.

20: All members stressed that monetary policy was not on a pre-set path. The Committee would remain sensitive to heightened unpredictability in the economic environment and would continue to update its assessment of risks.

21: At this meeting, five members voted to reduce Bank Rate to 4.25%. Prior to the latest global developments, most members in this group had judged that this policy decision would be finely balanced between no change in Bank Rate and a further reduction. Although the current impact of the global trade news should not be overstated, the news was sufficient for those members to judge that a reduction in Bank Rate was warranted. This level of Bank Rate would still leave the stance of monetary policy sufficiently restrictive to bear down on inflationary pressures, were they to re-intensify. For the other members in this group, even in the absence of the latest global news, the case for a reduction in Bank Rate at this meeting had been fairly clear. Underlying domestic disinflation was progressing as expected and monetary policy restrictiveness was bearing down on activity.

22: Two members preferred a 0.5 percentage point reduction in Bank Rate at this meeting based on the outlook. The most significant contributions to the expected pickup in inflation would come from one-off tax and administered prices and past energy shocks. Incoming wage settlements had so far been close to the Agents’ annual pay survey figure for the end of 2025, and were approaching sustainable rates, while consumer spending remained weak and investment subdued. Along with domestic demand shifts and emerging slack, recent global developments in energy and trade policy pointed to potential downward risks to global growth and world export prices. In the medium term, a continued monetary policy stance that was too restrictive risked inflation deviating from the 2% target on a sustained basis and the opening up of an unduly large output gap. Given this balance of risks, a less restrictive policy path was warranted.

23: Two members preferred to hold Bank Rate at 4.5%, recognising that short-end market interest rates had already eased by around 40 basis points since the MPC’s previous meeting. For these members, the labour market was proving more resilient than expected, business surveys signalled continued inflationary pressures, and household expectations of inflation had firmed. All these indicators pointed to continued inflation persistence owing in part to structural rigidities on the supply side of the economy. Holding Bank Rate unchanged at this meeting would ensure that monetary policy remained sufficiently restrictive to weigh against stubborn inflationary pressures.

24: Based on the Committee’s evolving view of the medium-term outlook for inflation, a gradual and careful approach to the further withdrawal of monetary policy restraint remained appropriate. The Committee would continue to monitor closely the risks of inflation persistence and what the evidence may reveal about the balance between aggregate supply and demand in the economy. Monetary policy would need to continue to remain restrictive for sufficiently long until the risks to inflation returning sustainably to the 2% target in the medium term had dissipated further. The Committee would decide the appropriate degree of monetary policy restrictiveness at each meeting.

25: The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that:

Bank Rate should be reduced by 0.25 percentage points, to 4.25%.

26: Five members (Andrew Bailey, Sarah Breeden, Megan Greene, Clare Lombardelli and Dave Ramsden) voted in favour of the proposition. Four members voted against the proposition. Two members (Swati Dhingra and Alan Taylor) preferred to reduce Bank Rate by 0.5 percentage points, to 4%. Two members (Catherine L Mann and Huw Pill) preferred to leave Bank Rate unchanged, at 4.5%.

27: On 7 May, the stock of UK government bonds held for monetary policy purposes was £620 billion. The MPC had been briefed on the amended operational arrangements for gilt sales in 2025 Q2, ahead of their publication in a Market Notice on 10 April.

The US president said it was a ""great honour"" to strike an agreement with the UK and said deals with other countries would soon follow.

Posting on the Truth Social website, Mr Trump said: ""The agreement with the United Kingdom is a full and comprehensive one that will cement the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom for many years to come.

""Because of our long time history and allegiance together, it is a great honour to have the United Kingdom as our FIRST announcement. Many other deals, which are in serious stages of negotiation, to follow!""

Reports that the two countries had struck an agreement first emerged in the New York Times - and Sky News has since been told that terms had now been agreed.

Deputy political editor Sam Coates says he understands a ""heads of terms"" agreement, essentially a preliminary arrangement, has been agreed, which is a ""substantive"" step towards a full deal.

No physical UK-US trade document is expected to be signed today as a result.

While the details are yet to emerge, Sky News business correspondent Paul Kelso understands the UK has agreed to give some concessions on food and agriculture imports from the United States to secure an easing of export tariffs for the car industry.

Kelso said the ""heads of terms"" deal appears to be coming down to what the UK can secure by way of concessions on tariffs.

However, the UK has always maintained that it has ""red lines"" on lowering British food standards.

Shortly after the New York Times report emerged, the value of the British pound rose by 0.4% against the US dollar.

'Renewal for our country'

Mr Trump said ""this should be a very big and exciting day"" for the US and UK, in a post on Truth Social on Thursday, adding there would be an announcement in the Oval Office at 10am local time (3pm UK time).

Meanwhile, Sir Keir Starmer vowed to ""deliver security and renewal for our country"" ahead of an expected press conference this afternoon.

Speaking to the London defence conference, Sir Keir said: ""Talks with the US have been ongoing and you'll hear more from me about that later today.

""But make no mistake, I will always act in our national interest, for workers, businesses and families, to deliver security and renewal for our country.""

Senior Trump officials have been engaging in a flurry of meetings with trading partners since the US president announced his ""liberation day"" tariffs on both the US' geopolitical rivals and allies on 2 April.

Mr Trump imposed a 10% tariff on most countries including the UK during the announcement, along with higher ""reciprocal"" tariff rates for many trading partners.

However, those reciprocal tariffs were later suspended for 90 days.

Britain was not among the countries hit with the higher reciprocal tariffs because it imports more from the US than it exports there.

However, the UK was still impacted by a 25% tariff on all cars and all steel and aluminium imports to the US.

A UK official said on Tuesday that the two countries had made good progress on a trade deal that would likely include lower tariff quotas on steel and cars.

Mr Trump said the same day that he and top administration officials would review potential trade deals with other countries over the next two weeks to decide which ones to accept.

Last week, he said that he has ""potential"" trade deals with India, South Korea and Japan.

Asked on Sky News' Breakfast programme about the UK-EU summit on 19 May and how Sir Keir would balance relationships with the US and EU, Coates said: ""I think it is politically helpful for Keir Starmer to have got the heads of terms, the kind of main points of a US-UK trade deal, nailed down before we see what we have negotiated with the EU -- or, more importantly, Donald Trump sees what we have negotiated with the EU.""

Coates said there was ""always a danger"" that if it happened the other way around, Mr Trump would ""take umbrage"" at negotiations with the EU and ""downgrade, alter or put us further back in the queue"" when it came to a UK-US trade deal.

US and Chinese officials to discuss trade war

It comes as the US and China have been engaged in an escalating trade war since Mr Trump took office in January.

The Trump administration has raised tariffs on Chinese goods to 145% while Beijing has responded with levies of 125% in recent weeks.

US Treasury secretary Scott Bessent and US trade representative Jamieson Greer are set to meet their Chinese counterparts in Switzerland this week to discuss the trade war.

“We are also going to resurrect the American shipbuilding industry, including commercial shipbuilding and military shipbuilding,"" Trump said. “We used to make so many ships. We don’t make them anymore very much, but we’re going to make them very fast, very soon. It will have a huge impact to further enhance our national security.""

Trump announced the creation of a White House Office of Shipbuilding as part of the effort. He also proposed “special tax incentives to bring this industry home to America, where it belongs,"" but did not offer specifics. The White House has not provided additional details on the office’s scope or leadership.

China’s dominance in global shipbuilding was a focal point of Trump’s remarks. The U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) recently announced a fee of up to $1.5 million on Chinese-built vessels entering U.S. ports, citing unfair competition. Trade officials noted that the U.S. ranks 19th in global commercial ship production.

Bipartisan legislation has also been introduced to address these challenges. In December 2024, the Shipbuilding and Harbor Infrastructure for Prosperity and Security (SHIPS) for America Act, introduced by Sens. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., and Todd Young, R-Ind., along with Reps. John Garamendi, D-Calif., and Trent Kelly, R-Miss., seeks to revitalize the U.S. shipbuilding industry through federal oversight, funding, workforce development, and incentives for domestic production, which legislators say have been weakened by decades of neglect.

Trump’s announcement comes as other lawmakers also raise concerns about the state of U.S. shipbuilding. During the recent confirmation hearing for Navy Secretary nominee John Phelan, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker, R-Miss., called for reforms to address delays and budget overruns in major shipbuilding programs.

“We must stabilize shipbuilding programs, adopt commercial best practices and incentivize the shipyards to address workforce and productivity issues in a collaborative rather than combative manner,"" Wicker said. “And we can quickly inject innovation into naval procurement, particularly on unmanned ships.""

Industry leaders responded positively to Trump’s announcement. Shipbuilders Council of America president Matthew Paxton said the initiative is a step toward restoring U.S. competitiveness.

“The U.S. shipyard industry has long played a critical role in national security and remains committed to building the fleet of the future,"" Paxton said. “We applaud the creation of the White House Office of Shipbuilding and stand ready to work with the administration to restore American competitiveness and create thousands of skilled jobs.""

In a LinkedIn post, Eastern Shipbuilding Group, Inc. also voiced support.

“A strong, thriving shipbuilding sector is vital to our nation’s prosperity, national security, and energy dominance,"" the shipyard said in a statement. “By investing in American shipbuilders and restoring American leadership on the seas, the President will improve our security and create high-quality jobs that support families in Florida and communities across the country.""

Despite these measures, experts warn that the U.S. shipbuilding industry still faces challenges in workforce training, supply chain constraints, and overall manufacturing capacity. How the new White House office will address these concerns remains to be seen."|"“We are also going to resurrect the American shipbuilding industry, including commercial shipbuilding and military shipbuilding,"" Trump said.

Labor market expectations largely deteriorated in April, with households having lower expectations for both earnings growth and finding a job. Households also expect lower income growth over the next year, and their perceptions about both their current financial situation and their outlook for their financial situation one year from now deteriorated sharply. The survey was fielded from April 1 through April 30, 2025.

The main findings from the April 2025 Survey are:

Inflation

Median inflation expectations were unchanged at the one-year-ahead horizon at 3.6% and increased by 0.2 percentage point at the three-year-ahead horizon to 3.2%, the highest reading since July 2022. In contrast, median inflation expectations decreased by 0.2 percentage point at the five-year-ahead horizon to 2.7%. The survey’s measure of disagreement across respondents (the difference between the 75th and 25th percentile of inflation expectations) increased at the one- and three-year horizons and decreased slightly at the five-year horizon.

Median inflation uncertainty—or the uncertainty expressed regarding future inflation outcomes—increased at all three horizons.

Median home price growth expectations rose by 0.3 percentage point to 3.3%. This increase was broad-based across age, income, and education groups, and was largest for respondents in the West census region. This series has been moving in a narrow range between 3.0% and 3.3% since August 2023.

Year-ahead commodity price expectations increased by 0.3 percentage point for the price of gas to 3.5%, 0.8 percentage point for the cost of medical care to 8.7%, 2.4 percentage points for the cost of college to 9.1%, and 1.8 percentage points for rent to 9.0%. The year-ahead expected price of food decreased by 0.1 percentage point to 5.1%.

Labor Market

Median one-year-ahead expected earnings growth decreased by 0.3 percentage point to 2.5% in April, the lowest reading since December 2023.

Mean unemployment expectations—or the mean probability that the U.S. unemployment rate will be higher one year from now—increased by 0.1 percentage point to 44.1%, the measure’s highest reading since April 2020.

The mean perceived probability of losing one’s job in the next 12 months decreased by 0.4 percentage point to 15.3%. This decrease was most pronounced for those over the age of 60 and those with a high-school education or less. The mean probability of leaving one’s job voluntarily in the next 12 months increased by 0.2 percentage point to 18.2%. This increase was driven by respondents under the age of 40, those with a bachelor’s degree or higher, and those with household income below $50,000 per year.

The mean perceived probability of finding a job in the next three months if one’s current job was lost decreased by 1.9 percentage points to 49.2%, the lowest reading since March 2021. This decrease was most pronounced for respondents over the age of 60.

Household Finance

The median expected growth in household income decreased by 0.2 percentage point to 2.6% in April, the lowest reading since April 2021.

Median household nominal spending growth expectations increased by 0.3 percentage point to 5.2%. This increase was relatively broad-based across age and education groups.

Perceptions of credit access compared to a year ago improved in April, with the net share of households reporting it is easier versus harder to obtain credit than one year ago increasing. Expectations for future credit availability were largely unchanged.

The average perceived probability of missing a minimum debt payment over the next three months increased by 0.3 percentage point to 13.9%.

The median expected year-ahead change in taxes at current income level increased by 0.1 percentage point to 3.3% but remains well below the 12-month trailing average of 3.7%.

Median year-ahead expected growth in government debt increased by 0.2 percentage point to 4.8%, but remains near the March 2025 series low of 4.6%.

The mean perceived probability that the average interest rate on saving accounts will be higher in 12 months increased by 0.4 percentage point to 26.5%.

Perceptions about households’ current financial situations compared to a year ago deteriorated sharply in April, with the share of households reporting a worse situation rising and the share reporting a better situation declining. Similarly, year-ahead expectations about households’ financial situations deteriorated sharply.

The mean perceived probability that U.S. stock prices will be higher 12 months from now increased by 1.9 percentage points to 35.7%.



About the Survey of Consumer Expectations (SCE)



The SCE contains information about how consumers expect overall inflation and prices for food, gas, housing, and education to behave. It also provides insight into Americans’ views about job prospects and earnings growth and their expectations about future spending and access to credit. The SCE also provides measures of uncertainty regarding consumers’ outlooks. Expectations are also available by age, geography, income, education, and numeracy.

The SCE is a nationally representative, internet-based survey of a rotating panel of approximately 1,300 household heads. Respondents participate in the panel for up to 12 months, with a roughly equal number rotating in and out of the panel each month. Unlike comparable surveys based on repeated cross-sections with a different set of respondents in each wave, this panel allows us to observe the changes in expectations and behavior of the same individuals over time. For further information on the SCE, please refer to an overview of the survey methodology here, the FAQs, the interactive chart guide, and the survey questionnaire."|"Labor market expectations largely deteriorated in April, with households having lower expectations for both earnings growth and finding a job.

36|r/Economics|2025-05-08 23:01:43|https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/07/business/trade-deal-trump|"Trump will announce a ‘major trade deal’ with the UK Thursday | CNN Business"|"CNN —

President Donald Trump made a significant trade announcement Thursday with the United Kingdom, yet another sign of some possible relief from historically high tariffs that have threatened serious damage to the US and global economies.

The deal, hammered out at the 11th hour in a late-night call with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer Wednesday, is still in flux with details to be “ironed out,” Starmer said via a phone call into the Oval Office Thursday. But it marks a potential framework for other countries to get a reprieve from America’s tariffs.

Trump said the deal with the UK would be substantial.

“The agreement with the United Kingdom is a full and comprehensive one that will cement the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom for many years to come,” Trump said in a Truth Social post Thursday morning. “Because of our long time history and allegiance together, it is a great honor to have the United Kingdom as our FIRST announcement. Many other deals, which are in serious stages of negotiation, to follow!”

“This should be a very big and exciting day for the United States of America and the United Kingdom,” he said in a separate message.

However, the announcement with the UK is limited in scope, heavy on future commitments and leave in place the existing 10% universal tariffs Trump placed on virtually all goods coming into the United States during his “Liberation Day” announcement on April 2, according to a US and UK official who previewed the deal for CNN.

Trump on Thursday called it a “huge deal” but didn’t announce many aspects of the deal in the Oval Office, instead offering broad strokes. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the United Kingdom would reduce trade barriers of several agricultural products, including ethanol and beef, and machinery to the United States.

Britain will also be able to send 100,000 cars into the United States at a 10% tariff rate, reduced from the 25% autos tariffs Trump imposed on foreign cars, Lutnick announced. The UK will also join the US in imposing 25% tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum, creating a joint tariff agreement that will create a free trade zone for those metals between the two countries. Pharmaceuticals will also be exempt from tariffs between the two countries.

The countries’ officials stressed to CNN that there were still some details in flux – a point reiterated by Starmer and Peter Mandelson, the British ambassador to the United States, on Thursday. But the outlines of that announcement develop a concrete pathway to a broader trade pact.

Starmer has made the pursuit of a deal with Trump a key component of the bilateral relationship and made a point of elevating trade as key focus in his closed-door discussions with Trump during a visit to the White House in February. UK officials have expressed keen interest in a wide-ranging trade deal, but in recent weeks have taken a more targeted approach, pressing the administration on market access and options to ease Trump’s 25% auto and steel tariffs.

Financial markets cheered the news of a deal. The Dow rose nearly 400 points, or 0.9%. The broader S&P 500 was up 0.8%, and the Nasdaq was 1.1% higher. The FTSE 100 fell 0.2% after the trade news and a rate-cut announcement from the Bank of England earlier in the day Thursday.

Not a real ‘deal’

Despite the administration’s rhetoric that it is in advanced trade negotiations with more than a dozen countries, actual trade deals take significant time, often years, to hash out. They typically involve incredibly complex agreements, delving into the minutiae of various goods and non-tariff barriers. They often involve significant political considerations, as various parties seek to protect voters with special interests.

Instead, the “deal” Trump announced is more like a memorandum of understanding. That may result in lower tariffs on one particular country’s goods in the near term, but they’ll do little that amounts to a substantial economic win for quite some time.

In return for the United States easing the burden of the steel and aluminum tariffs on the United Kingdom, UK officials have proposed easing digital tax levies on large US tech companies and a concrete negotiating pathway to a more wide-ranging deal, the people said.

The announcement surprised some UK officials, who viewed recent weeks of talks as productive, but not reflective of an imminent agreement.

“This is expected to be a ‘heads of terms’ agreement which sets the broad contours of the arrangement,” JPMorgan analyst Allan Monks wrote in a note to clients Thursday. “The full details are yet to be determined bilaterally and will follow further negotiations”

JPMorgan said the scope of the deal appears limited, because US tariffs on the UK are expected to remain higher than they were before Trump’s “Liberation Day” announcement on April 2. The economic benefit to the United Kingdom will be small, Monks said.

More deals to come

This is just a single agreement. But the framework of a deal, however, provides a pathway for other countries to reach agreements with the United States that could lower their tax burdens.

Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs that went into effect April 7 and were paused for 90 days on April 9 affect dozens of countries. A hundred or so more are subject to the 10% universal tariff. The administration can’t possibly get those all done by July 8.

US officials described the rapid push towards an announcement as a reflection of Trump’s view of the UK offer as well as his long-standing regard for the “special relationship” underpinning the two close allies. He’s also quickly developed an appreciation for Starmer, one of the people said.

The broader economic and geopolitical dynamics have also been a factor in recent days, though administration officials have downplayed the extent. Trump is keenly aware that foreign leaders, business executives and, just this week, the Federal Reserve chair are all anxiously awaiting any sign of progress in the ongoing negotiations.

“The 90-day tariff pause, which is now roughly 25% over, provides little time for the typical back-and-forth trade discussions that require months if not years to craft a trade deal,” said Jacob Jensen, trade policy analyst at the American Action Forum, a center-right policy institute.

“There is a significant difference if these deals are official, written trade agreements rather than verbal commitments to buy more US products, as one has long-term economic implications and the other can be ignored down the line,” he added.

Trump said last month he would not extend the tariffs a second time — and, in fact, may act sooner to reinstate some tariffs for countries with whom his administration cannot reach an agreement, perhaps in a matter of a couple weeks.

“It will be difficult for the US trade representative to negotiate potentially 100 separate trade agreements within 90 days, meaning President Trump must soon determine whether tariffs will be reinstated or delayed further,” Jensen said.

And even if deals are ultimately completed with all countries, there’s no guarantee Trump would keep them. For example, Trump, in his first term, was instrumental in negotiating the USMCA free trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, only to abandon it in his second term, charging an on-again, off-again 25% tariff on some Mexican and Canadian goods. And by placing significant tariffs on virtually all goods coming into the United States, Trump also blew up a number of existing trade deals with allies.

Signs of de-escalation

For weeks, Trump officials have said they are talking to more than a dozen countries and are nearing a deal – and they are in advanced negotiations with India, the UK, South Korea and Japan. But Trump has frequently said he is in no rush to sign a deal, claiming that countries have been “ripping off” America for years and the high tariffs the United States has imposed will help balance trade.

Trump’s announcement of a trade deal with the UK is the second significant sign this week that the administration may be open to negotiations that would ultimately lower some tariffs on foreign nations.

On Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that he and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will both travel to Geneva, Switzerland, where they will meet their Chinese counterparts.

Although Bessent told Fox News not to expect a major trade deal from the meetings, he acknowledged it was an important step in negotiations and could de-escalate tensions that have led the United States to place at least a 145% tariff on most Chinese goods. In turn, China has placed a 125% tariff on US goods.

Trump, however, on Wednesday said he would not lower the high tariffs on China in advance of discussions, which Beijing has previously said was a pre-condition for talks.

When asked in the Oval Office whether he was open to pulling back the historically high tariffs to get China to the negotiating table, Trump replied simply with: “No.”

Nevertheless, any thaw in the trade war could be a welcome sign for businesses and consumers in both countries and around the globe.

The punishing tariffs have already damaged economies around the world — particularly America’s. The US economy went into reverse in the first quarter, its first contraction in three years, as businesses stockpiled goods in anticipation of Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs, which began in the second quarter.

Although the China-US trade standoff is by far the most aggressive, Trump has imposed large tariffs on most other countries around the world too: a 10% universal tariff on virtually all goods entering the United States, plus 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum, autos, auto parts and some goods from Mexico and Canada.

So the world will be watching Thursday’s announcement and the US-China talks this weekend with anticipation.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday said at a press conference that tariffs could do serious damage to America’s economy. But he said the trade talks the United States is holding with foreign countries could prevent the worst-case scenario.

Global economists at the International Monetary Fund, OECD and World Bank have all predicted that Trump’s trade war would have disastrous effects on the global economy, slowing growth dramatically in some countries, while reigniting inflation. Many US economists and large banks predict the United States could enter a recession this year.

“It’s so bizarre,” said Jan Valeskog, Stockholm’s vice-mayor for planning. “It’s our political priorities that count, not the ones from this embassy or any other embassies.”

In March, European officials lambasted the US after companies across the continent said they had received letters informing them that the Trump administration’s crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives also applied to foreign firms looking to do business with the US government.

The letter – described by French officials as “a form of interference” – asked recipients to complete, sign and return a form certifying that they “do not operate any programmes to promote diversity, equity and inclusion”.

The letter added: “If you do not agree to sign this document, we would appreciate it if you could provide detailed reasons, which we will forward to our legal teams.”

In Stockholm, Valeskog said he had received the letter on Tuesday. “We were really surprised, because diversity, equality and inclusion are values that we strive for and stand up for in Stockholm,” he said. “It’s very important for us.”

He presumed the letter was sent to the planning office because it was listed as a payee, given that it charges for building permits. Still, it was the first time he had heard of one of these letters being directed at a municipality or foreign government. “It’s quite unique,” he said.

After Valeskog spoke to the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter about the letter, emails and social media responses came pouring in from city residents and others across Sweden. “Thousands of people are really upset,” he said. “I guess most people are following the news about what is happening in the States. But suddenly it felt closer with these demands.”

For months – despite research showing that companies with greater gender and ethnic diversity are more likely to significantly outperform their peers – Trump’s administration has opposed efforts to ensure that people of all backgrounds, including historically marginalised groups such as women and people of colour, can gain a foothold and thrive at organisations.

Valeskog said Stockholm had no intention of complying. “Of course, we’ll not sign it, we won’t return it, we’ll do nothing about it,” he said. “So now it’s up to the embassy to decide what happens next.”

The spate of US letters comes at a delicate moment for the transatlantic relationship, which has been left rattled by threats of escalating tariffs, security concerns and the Signal leaks that laid bare the Trump administration’s disdain for Europe.

On Tuesday Valeskog called on the embassy, with whom they had traditionally had a good relationship, to withdraw the letter. Two days later, there had been no reaction. “They don’t have an ambassador, maybe that’s the reason – I don’t know,” he said.

After describing the fallout over the letter as “their headache, not ours” earlier in the week, he again stressed that the US embassy stood to lose much more if it decided to break off its relationship with the municipality. “The embassy now and then needs our building permits, of course, so it’s in their interest to have a good contact and cooperation with the city of Stockholm,” he said. “And so this is really strange.”

He said his office would continue to wait for some sort of response from the Americans. “I mean it’s quite big news, not only in Sweden but also in other countries,” he said. “So we’ll see what happens.”"|"The letter added: “If you do not agree to sign this document, we would appreciate it if you could provide detailed reasons, which we will forward to our legal teams.”In Stockholm, Valeskog said he had received the letter on Tuesday.

In an interview with Fox News, JD Vance said, ""What we can do is try to encourage these folks to de-escalate a little bit, but we’re not going to get involved in the middle of war that’s fundamentally none of our business and has nothing to do with America’s ability to control it.""

""You know, America can’t tell the Indians to lay down their arms. We can’t tell the Pakistanis to lay down their arms. And so, we’re going to continue to pursue this thing through diplomatic channels,"" Vance said.

""Our hope and our expectation is that this is not going to spiral into a broader regional war or, God forbid, a nuclear conflict. Right now, we don’t think that’s going to happen,"" Vance added.

Pakistan on Thursday escalated the tense situation by targeting civilian and military areas with a swarm of drones, missiles and intense artillery shelling. While India on May 7 targeted terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (POK) as part of Operation Sindoor. India not only intercepted the drones and missiles, but also took down Pakistani fighter jets and an Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS).

Earlier, US President Donald Trump said if he could do anything to help, ""I will be there"" and wants the escalating conflict between the two countries to ""stop"".

""Oh it's so terrible. My position is I get along with both. I know both very well and I want to see them work it out. I want to see them stop and hopefully they can stop now. They have gone tit for tat so hopefully they can stop now. I know them both, we get along with both the countries very well.

""Good relationships with both and I want to see it stop. And If I can do anything to help I will be there,"" Trump said in response to a question on the 'war' between India and Pakistan.

Trump has also said that he hopes that the hostilities will end ""very quickly"".

""It's a shame, he said, adding, ""We heard about it just as we were walking in the doors of the Oval (Office). I guess people knew something was going to happen based on a little bit of the past.""

France is ramping up its production of Hammer bombs, which Ukraine has used to take out Russian military targets.

French company Safran Electronics & Defense told Business Insider that it is increasing production of AASM Hammer bombs by more than 40% this year.

A company spokeswoman told BI that it expects to make 1,200 AASMs in 2025, up from 830 in 2024.

And the company plans on going further. The spokeswoman added that ""we plan to double this rate over the next few years, if the orders are there.""

It's unclear how many of the bombs will go to Ukraine's military. The spokesperson said she couldn't give details on that, but added, ""I can confirm that AASMs are combat-proven and used in Ukraine.""

The Hammer is an air-to-surface weapon with a guidance and propulsion kit that turns munitions into precision-guided bombs capable of deep strikes and close-air-support missions.

They have been fitted to Ukraine's older, Soviet-era jets, and footage has shown them allegedly striking Russian troops and drone hubs. Ukraine also said it used them to hit a control center in Russia.

Safran said the Hammer has a range of more than 43 miles.

Hammer bombs are a type of glide bomb, a piece of weaponry that Ukraine has increasingly adopted throughout the war, after Russia used them to devastating effect.

Glide bombs are typically older munitions that have been converted into precision-guided weapons that are hard to intercept. They're also significantly cheaper than many other types of weaponry, which means they can be easily mass-produced.

Ukraine has increasingly used glide bombs, including domestically made ones.

Safran has adapted the Hammer bombs so they could be used with Ukraine's MiG-29 and Su-25 aircraft.

It's not clear how many Hammer bombs Ukraine has received to date, but France's defense minister, Sébastien Lecornu, said in January 2024 that France would be delivering 50 to Ukraine every month.

Safran's jump in production comes as European defense companies increasingly look to boost their production, as European nations increase their aid to Ukraine and their own defense spending.

Europe's overall defense spending has soared since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022, with many countries fearful that Russia may attack elsewhere on the continent.

European leaders have warned that much more needs to be done, including countries placing larger orders and changing rules that may be preventing defense-related industries from ramping up production.

Some European defense companies have said that they need larger orders to give them the confidence to make sizable investments, like new production facilities, that would allow them to grow their output over many years."|"France is ramping up its production of Hammer bombs, which Ukraine has used to take out Russian military targets.
French company Safran Electronics & Defense told Business Insider that it is increasing production of AASM Hammer bombs by more than 40% this year.

The European Union will propose tariffs on Boeing Co. aircraft and US-made cars if talks with President Donald Trump’s administration fail to de-escalate a brewing trade conflict, according to people familiar with the deliberations.

US industrial goods face the biggest reprisals, while food and agriculture products also will be among the top categories in a new list of duties that the commission will make public on Thursday, the people said on condition of anonymity because the discussions are private. About €100 billion ($114 billion) in American exports would be hit with additional tariffs, Bloomberg reported Tuesday.

A surcharge on Boeing sales would help equalize a playing field that EU officials consider unfair to Toulouse, France-based Airbus SE, whose imports to the US are now subject to tariffs, one person said.

Slapping Boeing with tariffs also would punish America’s biggest manufacturing exporter, should the EU decide to counter the unilateral levies Trump imposed on the bloc along with dozens of other US trading partners. The simultaneous US tariff war with China already is squeezing Boeing, with Beijing telling airlines to refrain from taking delivery of its jets.

The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm that handles trade matters, has been meeting with US officials ever since Trump announced a 20% universal tariff — reduced to 10% until July — on almost all imports from the EU. He also imposed a 25% levy on cars and metals.

A spokesperson for the commission declined to comment on the plans. A Boeing spokesperson couldn’t immediately be reached.

Boeing shares fell as much as 1.3% in New York. The stock has risen 4.4% this year as the company makes progress in improving manufacturing quality.

Negotiations between the EU and US have made scant progress and the expectation is that the bulk of the American tariffs will remain in place. The EU said on Tuesday that Trump’s ongoing trade investigations will boost the amount of the bloc’s goods facing tariffs to €549 billion, or 97% of the total.

The US imported more than $52.3 billion worth of new vehicles from the EU last year, according to Commerce Department data. Much of the $11.3 billion worth of autos that the US exported to the bloc were sport utility vehicles built by German manufacturers BMW AG and Mercedes-Benz Group AG."|"Most Read from BloombergThe European Union will propose tariffs on Boeing Co. aircraft and US-made cars if talks with President Donald Trump’s administration fail to de-escalate a brewing trade conflict, according to people familiar with the deliberations.

Russia will restrict internet access across several regions, including Moscow, during its May 9 Victory Day celebrations this year, as the Kremlin imposes ever-tighter controls over its population.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Wednesday that mobile internet restrictions would be in place in several regions while foreign leaders are in Moscow for the celebrations marking the surrender of Nazi Germany in World War II.

Peskov said the restrictions are because Russia has ""dangerous neighbors.""

""These are not disruptions, but restrictions for obvious reasons,"" he said. ""We want the glorious Victory Day to be celebrated at the appropriate level.""

Russian independent media outlet Meduza reported that restrictions have already been put in place in some areas, with Moscow residents experiencing phone and internet access issues since May 5.

Victory Day celebrations are a major propaganda event for Russia's President Vladimir Putin. World leaders, including China's Xi Jinping and Brazil's Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, will attend this year's event.

Putin has also called for a three-day cease-fire with Ukraine over the Victory Day weekend, which Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has rejected, describing the offer as a ""stunt.""

In the run-up to May 9, Ukraine has intensified its drone strike campaign against Russia, hitting Moscow with consecutive nights of attacks that closed its international airports.

Russia's association of tour operators said in a statement on Wednesday that at least 350 flights were affected by the threat of drone strikes.

Zelenskyy suggested that those travelling to the country may not be safe, remarking that ""our position is very simple for all countries travelling to Russia on May 9: We cannot be held responsible for what happens on the territory of the Russian Federation.""

Cuts to internet access

In the wake of its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Russia imposed sweeping internet restrictions on its population.

As part of its ""sovereign internet"" project, and in a bid to more tightly monitor online spaces and access to information, Russia has restricted access to the global internet, as well as VPN services used to circumvent domestic controls.

Further restrictions have already been imposed in areas of Russia targeted by Ukrainian drone strikes, with Russian outlet Kommersant reporting that restrictions were put in place in the city of Rostov on April 25.

Kommersant suggested that this was related to concerns that mobile internet networks could be used to direct drone attacks.

""Russian authorities will likely continue disconnecting large areas of Russia from mobile internet networks during Ukrainian long-range strikes,"" the Washington, D.C.-based Institute for the Study of War wrote on Wednesday.

It said that it would do this ""to continue testing the Sovereign Internet system and, secondarily, prevent Russians from immediately circulating reports, imagery, and footage of the results of these Ukrainian strikes."""|"Military vehicles taking part in Russia's Victory Day parade in Moscow in 2024.

However, The Moscow Times noted that although Beijing has become Moscow's largest trading partner since the Kremlin launched its full-scale war against Ukraine, it has so far refrained from significant investment in the real sector of the Russian economy.

Statistics from the Russian Central Bank show that over the past three years, there has been no significant capital inflow from countries the Kremlin considers friendly.

On the contrary, the total volume of foreign direct investment in Russia has continued to decline, falling by US$138 billion in 2022, US$80 billion in 2023 and a further US$63 billion last year.

Since the start of the full-scale invasion, Russia has lost 57% of its foreign investment, with the total volume dropping to US$216 billion – the lowest level since 2009, according to the Russian Central Bank.

Denmark's foreign minister says he will summon the US ambassador to address a report that Washington's spy agencies have been told to focus on Greenland amid Donald Trump's threats to take over the island. ""It worries me greatly because we do not spy on friends,"" Lars Løkke Rasmussen said, responding to the report in The Wall Street Journal. According to the newspaper, US spy agencies were told to focus efforts on the semi-autonomous country's independence movement, and American goals to extract mineral resources there. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard accused the Journal of attempts to ""undermine"" President Trump ""by politicizing and leaking classified information"".

While not denying the report, she accused the newspaper of ""breaking the law and undermining our nation's security and democracy"". Rasmussen, who was attending an EU ministers meeting in Warsaw, said the report was ""somewhat disturbing"". ""We are going to call in the US acting ambassador for a discussion at the foreign ministry to see if we can confirm this information,"" Rasmussen said. ""It doesn't seem to be strongly rejected by those who speak out. That worries me."" The Danish Security and Intelligence Service (PET) declined to comment on the article, but told Danish media that it had ""naturally"" taken note of US interest in Greenland. Based on international interest in Greenland in general, the agency said, there was an increased espionage threat against it and Denmark. President Trump has repeatedly vowed to take control of Greenland, most recently telling NBC News on Sunday that he had not ruled out using military force to seize the arctic island. ""I don't say I'm going to do it, but I don't rule out anything,"" he said. ""We need Greenland very badly. Greenland is a very small amount of people, which we'll take care of, and we'll cherish them, and all of that. But we need that for international security.""

During a speech to Congress in March, Trump told US lawmakers that ""one way or the other, we're going to get it."" Danish officials also condemned a visit to Greenland by Vice-President JD Vance in March. Danish PM Mette Frederiksen said the visit to a remote US military base ""completely unacceptable pressure on Greenland, Greenlandic politicians and the Greenlandic population""."|"Denmark summons US ambassador over Greenland spying report1 day ago Share Save Max Matza BBC News Share SaveGetty ImagesDenmark's foreign minister says he will summon the US ambassador to address a report that Washington's spy agencies have been told to focus on Greenland amid Donald Trump's threats to take over the island.

Russia and China warned on Wednesday that Donald Trump’s proposed “Golden Iron Dome for America” missile defense system would destabilize global security and turn outer space into a new arena for armed confrontation.

“The recently announced large-scale ‘Golden (Iron) Dome for America’ program is deeply destabilizing,” the two sides said in a joint statement during a visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping to Moscow. The U.S. plan “explicitly provides for a significant strengthening of the arsenal for conducting combat operations in space,” it added.

White smoke emanating from the Sistine Chapel chimney today to inform the world’s 1.4 billion Catholics and everyone else that the conclave of 133 cardinals have determined a new Bishop of Rome. Who the successor to St. Peter and the progressive Pope Francis, who died at the age of 88 on April 21, is has not yet been made public.

Having said that, as cable news and the internet goes wall-to-wall white smoke, the unveiling of the newly appointed Pontiff is expected within a hour or so to appear on the balcony. At that time the world will learn what name the now elevated former cardinal has chosen for his Papacy.

In a ceremony reaching back to 1274 in its present form, a Pope is elected from the cardinals’ ranks with a required two-thirds majority. Achieving that majority is what leads to multiple ballots among the conclave. The first of what was four scheduled ballots Thursday concluded around 1:30 am PT or 10:30 am local time in Rome. With no Pope elected that round, a plume of black smoke soon afterwards blew out of from the temporary chimney erected atop the Sistine Chapel. The lack of a leader for the Holy See also meant there was no ringing of the bells of St. Peter’s Basilica this morning.

Watch on Deadline

At that point, the cardinals took a break and resumed voting about an hour later. Now the bells are ringing aloud over the cheers of tens of thousands.

Dramatic license aside, the Oscar-nominated Conclave, starring Ralph Fiennes, Stanley Tucci, Isabella Rossellini, and John Lithgow, put a spotlight over the last year on the process of selecting a new Pope. Accurately displaying the absent of smartphones and the isolation of the cardinals that is actually part of a conclave, Conclave the movie also leans into fiction with its depiction of the political maneuvering that takes place in the exercise.

Still, even with thousands of journalists awaiting the results of Thursday morning’s balloting, there is much about what went on behind locked doors with the College of Cardinals this week that will likely never be known.

Likely to be asked by Vatican watchers is what instructions the rookie cardinals, most of whom were selected by Francis over his 12-year reign, received and asked for to carry out their duties. Also, an explanation as to why Day One of voting on May 7 to fill the Papal vacancy went hours longer than anticipated will surely be near the top of the list of inquiries.

As ballots were burned, black smoke billowed out of the Vatican chimney around 9 pm local time on Wednesday indicating the cardinals had not reached the majority requirement. Unto itself, besides the late hour, that wasn’t unusual or unexpected. It took two days with four and five ballots respectively for Benedict XVI in 2005 and Francis in 2013 for a Pope to be chosen.

In 1978, the selection of Polish Cardinal Karol Wojtyła to be John Paul II went longer than that of his immediate successors and his predecessors. The future head of the Holy See’s election took eight ballots and three days. Which is a lot better than the papal conclave that followed the death of Clement IV. That conclave ran from 1268 to 1271, and only ended with the election of Gregory X after the bickering cardinals were finally refused food and exposed to the elements to get the job done.

Thankfully for all concerned, that wasn’t required this year."|"In a ceremony reaching back to 1274 in its present form, a Pope is elected from the cardinals’ ranks with a required two-thirds majority.

Trump hit Europe on April 2 with 20 percent “reciprocal” tariffs on most goods, before dialing them back a week later to the 10 percent he had imposed on most countries, as stock and bond markets panicked over the hit to U.S. growth and prices they would cause.

It however expects the Trump administration to have more flexibility on lowering the 10 percent U.S. baseline tariff, while the levies on cars, steel and aluminum are likely to stay as it pursues its “reindustrialization strategy goal,” a senior European Commission official said."|"The EU is also considering restricting exports of scrap steel and chemical products worth €4.4 billion.

This initiative aims to provide financial resources to Ukraine using the profits from frozen Russian assets.

Source: a statement by the European Commission, as reported by European Pravda

Details: The Commission emphasised that symbolically, the payment of this €1 billion coincided with the Day of Remembrance and Victory over Nazism.

In total, macro-financial assistance stands at €18.1 billion, contributing to the EU's participation in the G7 Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration initiative. This initiative is intended to provide Ukraine with around €45 billion in financial support.

These loans are to be repaid using the income generated from frozen Russian state assets in the EU. With this payment, the total amount of loans to Ukraine from the Commission under this programme in 2025 has reached €6 billion.

Ukraine’s Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal stated that these funds would be directed toward covering critically important budget expenditures and strengthening the state.

Quote from Shmyhal: ""This tranche is part of a fair and consistent approach: the aggressor must pay for the destruction they have brought to our land. We are now expecting the next step – the full confiscation of assets and the strengthening of sanctions in response to Russia's atrocities.""

Details: The statement also highlighted that the European Commission is prepared to provide advance financing as part of the EU's contribution to the ERA initiative.

Background:

In 2024, the G7 agreed to jointly provide Ukraine with a US$50 billion loan backed by Russian assets. Though formally disbursed as credit, the funds are to be repaid using interest accrued from the frozen assets.

India’s Operation Sindoor has not just avenged the deaths of the 26 people in the Pahalgam attack, but also had a far-reaching impact on the global fight against terrorism. The Indian Armed Forces’ precision strikes on Wednesday reportedly killed Abdul Rauf Azhar, the operational head of Jaish-e-Mohammad and mastermind of the IC-814 hijacking.

Azhar was involved in the kidnapping and murder of Wall Street Journal journalist Daniel Pearl in 2002. Hence, yesterday’s strikes on nine terror hubs in PoK and Pakistan delivered justice to the American-Jewish journalist.

How is Azhar connected to Pearl’s death?

Azhar’s role in orchestrating the 1999 Kandahar hijack facilitated the release of Omar Saeed Sheikh, a key Al-Qaeda operative, who kidnapped and murdered Pearl. The journalist was beheaded in 2002, an execution that shocked the world.

An investigative journalist, Pearl disappeared in Pakistan’s Karachi on January 23, 2002. He was reportedly scheduled to interview a religious leader as part of his research into Islamic extremism.

He was abducted near a cafe, where terrorists captured him and accused him of being a spy. Identifying themselves as the National Movement for the Restoration of Pakistani Sovereignty, the group demanded the release of Pakistanis imprisoned by the United States.

Is Rauf Azhar dead?

Reportedly, yes. According to a report by News18, officials have said that precision attacks carried out in Pakistan’s Punjab province killed Azhar.

“Among those reported eliminated is Abdul Rauf Azhar — operational head of Jaishe-Mohammad, mastermind of the IC-814 hijacking, and a central figure in international jihadist networks,"" the officials said.

On Tuesday, thousands of Panamanians marched in the capital in the largest protest yet against an agreement signed during last month’s visit by U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.

The U.S. embassy followed with a statement Wednesday saying that the agreement did not allow for establishing military bases in Panama. A U.S. military presence in Panama is sensitive, since people still remember the U.S. invasion in 1989 and U.S. President Donald Trump has suggested that the U.S. take back control of the Panama Canal.

“Panama’s sovereignty is not at stake, it’s not handed over, it’s not given,” Mulino said during his weekly press conference. He insisted the agreement would not lead to U.S. bases in Panama.

Later Thursday, the new U.S. ambassador to Panama, Kevin Marino Carbera, said in a news conference that “the memorandum (of understanding) is going to strengthen our cooperation against drug trafficking and protect the (Panama) canal and we know that’s the responsibility of both countries according to the (canal) treaty.”

The locations where U.S. troops and contractors will have access will always remain under the control of Panama and it can terminate the agreement with six months notice, the Panamanian government has said.

Protests during recent weeks have closed streets and drawn thousands.

Mulino said they were the result of political interests.

Moscow's friends in the bloc say it's a 'serious mistake'|"""We recognize the strategic goal of reducing energy dependence on third countries, and Slovakia is ready to work on this together with the European Union but ... this is simply economic suicide to agree that neither gas, nor nuclear, nor oil [can be imported from Russia], that everything must end just because some new Iron Curtain is being built between the Western world and perhaps Russia and other countries,"" Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico said Wednesday, in comments reported by Slovak news agency TASR and translated by Google.

Slovakia and Hungary, whose governments have maintained warm ties with Moscow despite the war in Ukraine, described the EU's latest plans as a ""serious mistake"" that would harm the region.

The EU's latest proposals have already prompted a furious response from eastern European nations which have traditionally been more reliant on cheaper energy supplies from Russia, and which repeatedly warn of higher energy prices for consumers as a result of banning such supplies.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 prompted the EU to ban most seaborne imports of Russian oil, coal and refined petroleum products , but reducing gas flows has proved more difficult. In 2024, almost 19% of the EU's gas and LNG imports still came from Russia, according to data from the European Commission , although that's down from 2021 when 45% of the region's gas came from the major oil and gas exporter.

The European Commission announced plans on Tuesday to phase out Russian gas, nuclear energy and liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports by the end of 2027, saying the move ""paves the way to ensure the EU's full energy independence from Russia.""

Russia's allies in Eastern Europe say Brussels plans to end all Russian gas and energy imports in the coming years are tantamount to ""economic suicide"" and a threat to the region's energy security and economy.

In this pool photograph distributed by Russian state agency Sputnik, Russia's President Vladimir Putin shakes hands with Slovakia's Prime Minister Robert Fico prior to their talks in Moscow on Dec. 22, 2024.

Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó said Wednesday that the EU's proposals were ""politically motivated"" and a ""serious mistake.""

""It threatens energy security, drives up prices and violates sovereignty. They want us to bear the cost of their reckless support for Ukraine and its rushed EU accession. We firmly reject this,"" the minister commented on X.

Both Hungary and Slovakia have pushed back against previous EU initiatives to cut energy ties with Moscow, instead opting to maintain supplies amid fears of mounting energy costs at home.

Both have also been vocally critical of giving more military and financial assistance to Ukraine and have previously threatened refused to back the EU's regular extensions of sanctions against Russia. Both looked to extract concessions from the bloc before approving their renewal, most recently in March.

In announcing its latest plans to distance itself from Russia, the EU said Tuesday that its ""roadmap"" to phasing out all Russian energy imports would first introduce a ban on all imports of Russian gas (both pipeline and LNG) under new contracts and existing spot contracts, which would take effect by the end of 2025, before all remaining imports are phased out by the end of 2027.

The Commission's legislative proposals, to be presented in June, will require approval from the European Parliament and a qualified majority of member states, meaning the plans cannot be vetoed by just a few countries.

""We can adopt it without unanimity,"" European Commissioner for Energy Dan Jorgensen said in a press conference Tuesday, adding, ""I hope that everybody will vote for it, obviously, but if they don't, that is also ok, that is also part of the European Union that sometimes the majority makes decisions when necessary.""

He added that the bloc was currently in an ""unacceptable situation"" in which it was dependent on a Russian state and leader, President Vladimir Putin, who had ""chosen to weaponize energy."" He added that importing Russian gas had indirectly helped to fill the Kremlin's ""war chests"" to continue its war against Ukraine.

The Commission said in its statement Tuesday that it envisaged a ""gradual and well-coordinated"" approach across bloc, with member states being asked to prepare national plans by the end of this year ""setting out how they will contribute to phasing out imports of Russian gas, nuclear energy and oil."" It's uncertain whether Slovakia and Hungary will accede to the request.

A Commission spokesperson told CNBC Wednesday that it ""will work closely with all Member States on the implementation of this plan, especially with those mostly concerned. This is why we are proposing a gradual and well-managed phaseout, which is backed by continuous efforts at diversification and better use of energy infrastructure.""

CNBC has asked the Kremlin for a response to the EU's proposals and is awaiting a reply."|"Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 prompted the EU to ban most seaborne imports of Russian oil, coal and refined petroleum products , but reducing gas flows has proved more difficult.

. Kashmir has remained a contested region between India and Pakistan since the 1947 partition of British India, with the two nations having fought three wars over the territory. The most recent conflict occurred in 1999, following nuclear tests by both countries. The artillery shortage comes amid heightened tensions following an 22 April attack in the Pahalgam area of Indian-administered Kashmir. A group called Kashmir Resistance claimed responsibility for the assault on a tourist village, resulting in 26 fatalities. The group cited dissatisfaction with the resettlement of over 85,000 outsiders in the region as their motivation. India has accused Pakistan of supporting the militants responsible, a claim Pakistan denies

Sources within Indian intelligence indicate that Pakistan’s current ammunition stockpiles would only sustain high-intensity combat operations for approximately four days.

This depletion stems from extensive exports to conflict zones, particularly Ukraine and Israel, according to ANI News and Lokhma Times.

Pakistani ammunition factories became undisclosed suppliers to Ukraine following Russia’s full-scale invasion, Indian media reports. Between February and March 2023, Pakistan shipped 42,000 122mm rockets for Grad BM-21 systems, 60,000 155mm howitzer shells, and an additional 130,000 122mm rockets to Ukraine, generating $364 million in revenue.

This ammunition transfer has reportedly left Pakistan’s key weapons systems, including M109 howitzers and Grad rocket systems, without adequate ammunition supplies.

Where does Ukraine get artillery shells?

Besides Pakistan, Ukraine receives artillery shells from the European Union, promising 2 million artillery shells by 2026, with two-thirds already delivered ahead of schedule.

These shells come from both EU domestic production and external suppliers, including South Korean and South African defense firms.

Czechia leads a significant independent multinational initiative, supplying over 1.5 million shells in 2024 and expecting to deliver 1.8 million more in 2025.

This effort, supported by around 20 countries including Canada, Norway, and Denmark, aims to address Ukraine’s ammunition shortages and has already delivered 400,000 shells this year.

Ukraine also produces a large number of artillery shells domestically, with current annual production around 2.5 million shells and plans to fully meet its artillery needs through domestic production by 2025."|"Amid potential conflict with India, Pakistan is grappling with a critical shortage of artillery ammunition due to alleged large-scale exports to Ukraine and Israel, according to Indian media outlets, citing intelligence sources.

The GVN calls on world governments to address the threat of H5N1 avian influenza by enhancing surveillance, implementing biosecurity measures, and preparing for potential human-to-human transmission.

""Understanding the current landscape of H5N1 infections is critical for effective prevention and response,"" said Sten H. Vermund, MD, PhD, chief medical officer of the GVN and dean of the USF Health College of Public Health at the University of South Florida, USA. ""The virus’ ability to infect both animals and humans, combined with recent genetic changes, underscores the importance of proactive surveillance and rapid response measures.""

The outbreak has affected nearly 1000 dairy cow herds and resulted in more than 70 human cases, including the first confirmed death in the U.S. The U.S. poultry industry is at significant risk, particularly in areas with high-density farming and where personal protective practices may be lacking. The highly pathogenic influenza virus is now circulating in all 50 states and Canada, resulting in the loss or culling of more than 168 million poultry in the U.S. since 2022. While human-to-human transmission is not documented, experts warn that virus mutations and reassortments, or combining two flu viruses, could increase transmissibility.

""Genomic surveillance is pivotal in tracking viral evolution and informing response strategies,” said Marion Koopmans, DVM, PhD, center of excellence director at the GVN and head of the department of viroscience at Erasmus Medical Center, Netherlands. “Continued investment in surveillance at the human-animal interface, and immediate sharing of unusual field observations and sequence data is essential for researchers worldwide to monitor virus dynamics effectively."" Dr. Koopmans is a U.S. and Dutch National Academy of Sciences member. She is highly regarded for her research on emerging infectious diseases and as a scientific advisor to policymakers at national and international levels.

The GVN virologists underscore the need for improved pandemic preparedness, drawing on lessons learned from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and previous outbreaks. They advocate for a multi-faceted approach to pandemic preparedness, which includes:

Enhanced Surveillance: Continuous monitoring of animals, including testing of milk and wastewater and individuals working with infected animals, to track virus evolution that may lead to human-to human transmissibility. The GVN calls for more comprehensive state-wide testing in the U.S. and internationally. Faster Genomic Data Sharing: Accelerating the release of genomic data to track virus evolution and spatial transmission, fostering collaboration among global research networks. Improved Farm Biosecurity: Using personal protective equipment (PPE) and strict farm cleaning protocols to minimize human exposure and prevent virus spread. Preparedness Plans for the Roll-Out of Tests: Advocating for self-administered diagnostic tests for farm workers, supported by healthcare access for frontline medical staff, to enhance early detection. Strengthening Public Health Infrastructure: Increased funding and support for response mechanisms, particularly in high-risk regions, to better manage outbreaks. Investment in Phenotype Prediction from Genetic Data: Invest in predicting the phenotypes of avian influenza viruses from genetic data, as key traits are difficult to predict solely from genomic sequences. Investment in Rapid Vaccine Development: Encouraging the development and rapid deployment of vaccines for humans and animals, focusing on farm workers. Preparedness Plan for the Roll-Out of Vaccines and Therapeutics: Prepositioned clinical studies to rapidly assess the properties of emerging virus strains and potential treatments. Preparedness Plan to Allow for Rapid Clinical Studies: Focus on enabling rapid clinical studies to assess key properties of new pandemic strains, evaluate new vaccines and treatments, and support modeling efforts. International Collaboration: Supporting a coordinated global response to track data, share research, and prepare for emerging viral threats to reduce community vulnerabilities and improve response strategies.

""Initiatives should focus on enhancing biosecurity measures in agricultural settings and educating the public about safe handling of poultry products and potential risks associated with contact with infected animals,"" said Peter Palese, PhD, center of excellence director at the GVN and Horace W. Goldsmith Professor of the department of microbiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Dr. Palese is a world leader in influenza research and a U.S. National Academy of Sciences member.

“Given the growing circulation of H5N1 among mammals, the GVN calls for urgent efforts to understand and interrupt transmission in cattle through herd management and potential vaccination,” said Ab Osterhaus, DVM, PhD, center of excellence director at the GVN and founding director of the Center of Infection Medicine and Zoonosis Research at the University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Germany. “Strengthening surveillance at animal-human interfaces is crucial, as current monitoring efforts are insufficient to guide effective prevention strategies.” Dr. Osterhaus is internationally regarded for his work on animal viruses, SARS, MERS, and H5N1. He is a co-founder of the global One Health Community, and a Dutch and German National Academies of Sciences member.

While some surveillance of H5N1 has been carried out, the GVN highlights the lack of comprehensive testing and monitoring to assess the virus's spread and risks to public health.

“A robust nationwide monitoring system is essential to quickly detect, and quarantine affected animals and implement preventive measures to curb further spread and human infections,” said Elyse Stachler, PhD, member of the GVN and a research scientist at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, USA. “Further, we believe it is crucial to maintain trust and stakeholder buy-in for monitoring programs, particularly from farm workers.”

""We are advocating for community-driven strategies to ensure the successful implementation of vaccines, if necessary,” said Christian Bréchot, MD, PhD, vice chair of the board of directors and president emeritus of the GVN and director of the Microbiomes Institute and senior associate dean for research in global affairs in the USF Health Morsani College of Medicine, USA. “The situation with H5N1 demands heightened vigilance and collaboration across public health sectors. Early detection and robust surveillance are critical to prevent further spread.""

""But the dots tell a story,"" immunologist Gigi Gronvall says about the two prints she framed and hung behind her desk at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.

One image shows the meticulous mapping of a London-based cholera outbreak in 1854 by British physician John Snow, whose work pinpointed the source of the sickness: a contaminated water pump in the Soho district. ""The prevailing theory at the time was that cholera spread through air,"" Gronvall says of Snow's groundbreaking work. ""But by gathering and mapping the data, Snow uncovered what we know to be true today—cholera spreads through contact with sewage and feces.""

Dots delineate a different infectious disease in the other, more complex image. There, arrows point up and down and sideways to pink, black, and blue circles, squares, and triangles, tracking viral and genetic material gathered in January 2020 from animals and stalls at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, China. A data visualization from a paper in the journal Cell (September 2024), the intricate markings reveal the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in the materials tested.

For Gronvall, a national security expert and senior scholar at the Center for Health Security, every study like this contributes to our body of scientific knowledge and reminds us, in this case, of a pandemic that led to the loss of more than 7 million people worldwide and trillions of dollars from the U.S. economy. People associate pandemics with the risks posed to human health, but they affect all aspects of society, she says. ""That's another reason we need to figure out how COVID started and what we can learn from it.""

Although the scientific community lacks consensus on whether COVID-19 originated in the Wuhan market or elsewhere, most scientists agree on another matter: We can expect more pandemics to come, owing to factors like climate change, mass migration, globalization, and human encroachment on wildlife and insect ecosystems. According to the center's director Tom Inglesby, who served in COVID-related advisory roles during the pandemic at the White House and in the Department of Health and Human Services, ""as temperatures change, people are moving around the world more rapidly than ever before … and intruding into ecosystems that used to be made up entirely of animals or insects."" This, in turn, creates opportunities for humans to get infected by new diseases and disease strains.

We can expect more pandemics to come, owing to factors like climate change, mass migration, globalization, and human encroachment on wildlife and insect ecosystems.

Another factor contributing to the likelihood of future pandemics are the concentrations of people living in megacities like Tokyo, Delhi, and Shanghai—to name three on a fast-growing list of cities with more than 10 million inhabitants. ""In some, people live incredibly close together without great sanitation, creating conditions for rapid spread, Inglesby says."" This happened last year, for instance, in the Democratic Republic of Congo's capital city Kinshasa, home to 17 million. There, a new, more contagious strain of a disease typically confined to rural areas, mpox, spread quickly. As a result, mpox now poses a threat not only to Kinshasa and the DRC but also the world, given the international flights going in and out of Kinshasa daily.

Over the past few decades, public health experts have watched infectious diseases spring up and evolve in surprising ways. That's a main reason the Center for Health Security was created in the first place, Inglesby says of the group that started in 1998 and has helped fight anthrax attacks and other bioterrorist threats, plus outbreaks of swine flu (H1N1), yellow fever, the Ebola and Zika viruses, and COVID-19.

Chances are, Inglesby says, experts won't be able to predict the next pandemic. It could be the bird flu ravaging U.S. cattle and poultry farms and infecting humans. It could be Zika or dengue fever, spread by mosquitoes, or another strain of influenza or coronavirus. ""No one really knows,"" he says. ""That's why we need to heed lessons from the past and prepare.""

Today, five years after COVID-19 spread to every continent on Earth, killed millions, and left roughly 400 million people with brain fog, breathing difficulties, and other symptoms of long COVID, Inglesby and others want to share and highlight the lessons learned to better prepare us for the next one that will inevitably occur.

Much of what they learned relates to the months leading up to the pandemic, ""a critical window of opportunity to do everything you can to contain the disease,"" Inglesby says. It involves decisions made at the executive level to combat a fast-spreading new virus, along with the timeline and manner in which officials share information and deploy countermeasures. It also involves the steps taken—or not taken—to contend with misinformation, which Gronvall, who teaches a class on the 1918 influenza virus that killed roughly 50 million, says we can count on transpiring in all pandemics.

""We'll be unpacking COVID for decades to come, with doctoral students and scholars poring over the data,"" Gronvall says. But with other pandemics on the horizon and COVID-19 continuing to mutate and cause lasting complications for people with and without chronic health conditions, experts say our country can't ignore what it learned and put its head in the sand.

Lesson 1: Prepare for the worst

On Jan. 1, 2020, epidemiologist Caitlin Rivers opened her inbox to find an email from the disease outbreak surveillance system ProMED, sent one minute before midnight.

""I have a bad feeling about this,"" the senior scholar at the Center for Health Security thought to herself, unintentionally channeling the famous Star Wars line.

The email reported a cluster of pneumonia-like cases of unknown cause in Wuhan, the sprawling capital city of central China's Hubei province, with a population of 11 million. Government officials in China hadn't yet reported the illnesses, but the low-tech email service ProMED had pieced together the news from active chatter on Weibo, a Chinese microblogging site.

Following ProMED's alert, media outlets worldwide started reporting on the strange sickness that turned out to be the novel coronavirus, COVID-19. But according to a report by the nonprofit research institution Project Information Literature, other stories dominated the U.S. news cycle, such as the Senate's impeachment trial of President Donald Trump and the tragic death of basketball star Kobe Bryant. ""Buried deeper in the news flow were reports of a mysterious flu spreading through China,"" the report reads. ""To the Americans who followed this story, this threat seemed safely distant.""

But faculty at the Center for Health Security saw clear warning signs and took swift action. In a Foreign Affairs article published on Jan. 31, 2020, Inglesby reminded the world of a tenet of public health: preparation is the key to an effective response, or, as Benjamin Franklin put it, ""By failing to prepare, you prepare to fail.""

According to Inglesby, as evidence mounted in January that the novel virus could morph into a pandemic, ""governments [worldwide] needed to act immediately by organizing for the worst-case-scenario and turning on all required systems""—a tall order that involves stockpiling diagnostic tests and protective equipment, readying hospitals and health care workers, preparing schools and teachers, and pooling resources and teams to develop a vaccine, therapeutic drugs like antivirals, and the manufacturing supply chain to produce and distribute these products in record time.

""If, for some miraculous reason, a pandemic didn't occur, then the extra work would leave us better prepared for the next one,"" Inglesby says.

Did the right people listen?

Some pockets of the federal government ""were quietly, extremely concerned and doing what they could to prepare,"" Inglesby says. But the government's main effort involved regulating travel from China, with passengers facing health screenings and potential quarantines.

More travel restrictions and bans followed, measures that experts say did little to prevent the spread of a virus already widely circulating. According to Inglesby, ""there should never have been an assumption that shutting down travel was a foolproof strategy. People were moving around the world all the time, and it was too late.""

George W. Bush ""A pandemic is a lot like a forest fire. If caught early it might be extinguished with limited damage. If allowed to smolder, undetected, it can grow to an inferno that can spread quickly beyond our ability to control it.""

In February 2020, as COVID cases multiplied, Inglesby attended a federal government meeting with health care system leaders. ""People were worried, but the meeting was more like a brainstorming session, instead of [an action plan] to start implementing specific steps to prepare hospitals and health care workers,"" he says.

Why no plan?

Pandemic preparedness had been a federal priority since 2005, when President George W. Bush devoted $7 billion to the cause. ""A pandemic is a lot like a forest fire,"" Bush told scientists at the National Institutes of Health. ""If caught early it might be extinguished with limited damage. If allowed to smolder, undetected, it can grow to an inferno that can spread quickly beyond our ability to control it.""

The Obama administration continued the work, taking an aggressive approach to the Ebola epidemic in 2014 and establishing a global health security directorate (through the White House's National Security Council), with a mission to prepare for and, if possible, prevent the next outbreak from turning into an epidemic or pandemic. The directorate [created a 69-page playbook, delineating how to guide government sectors through the complex work of fighting health threats.

In 2018, however, the Trump administration dismantled the directorate, claiming it was overstaffed and needed streamlining. Some staff members merged with other groups, while others left their positions, resulting in what the directorate's former leader Beth Cameron described as a diminished federal workforce devoted to monitoring and mitigating disease spread when COVID broke out.

""In a health security crisis, speed is essential,"" Cameron wrote in a March 13, 2020, op-ed for The Washington Post. ""When this new coronavirus emerged, there was no clear White House-led structure to oversee our response, and we lost valuable time.""

For a country as large as the U.S., creating a unit to oversee and coordinate global health security, with backing from senior government officials, is essential, experts say.

Inglesby agrees. Fighting a disease, he explains, ""involves tremendous coordination among not only government sectors but also private companies, nonprofits, and countries and organizations worldwide. It requires a structured, strategic approach.""

Lesson 2: Deliver information, not reassurance

Sometimes it makes sense to withhold information or quell fear with words of reassurance. When a friend suffers a loss, one might say, You'll get through it. Everything will be OK.

When it comes to a health threat, however, placating the public isn't the right strategy, experts say, and it's a lesson Inglesby and Rivers hope the country will take from the pandemic.

When it comes to a health threat, placating the public isn't the right strategy.

""The job of public health and political leaders should never be to overly reassure,"" Inglesby says. ""The job is to be factual and to provide maximum information to people and their families so they can make good judgments and lower their own risk of spread.""

But as Rivers explains in her recently released book, Crisis Averted: The Hidden Science of Fighting Outbreaks, senior officials downplayed the threat in the weeks before and after COVID became a pandemic. Alex Azar, the secretary of Health and Human Services at the time, announced at press briefings in late February that the risk to the American public remained low, while President Trump tweeted that the health threat had been ""inflamed ... far beyond what the facts would warrant.""

For Rivers and others monitoring the situation, ""the risk to the United States was anything but low … [yet went] unnoticed by most of the public and [was] actively denied by elected leaders,"" she says. That's why, when the U.S. declared a national emergency on March 13, the country was caught off guard.

Rivers, in Crisis Averted, stresses the importance of sharing information in a straightforward, timely manner. ""Clarity is a core tenet of public health messaging,"" she writes. Delivering bad news is difficult, and even the best health officials sometimes use ""opaque language"" and ""fuzzy jargon"" to soften the blow. The problem with these approaches, however, is that they don't ""give the listener any sense of the magnitude of the problem, or any direction about how concerned to be,"" she says.

Instead, people can more easily grasp information delivered in plain language with concrete examples, Rivers continues. This is a goal of public health messaging, but it mostly went unmet early in the pandemic.

As Inglesby explains it, ""the more we're in the mode of dismissing or downplaying the [situation] or of reassuring people, the more anxious they're going to get,"" and the more susceptible they'll be to misinformation.

Instead, people need specific information and evidence-based advice about their own circumstances. ""Some of us face higher risks than others, whether we're elderly or have an underlying condition, or we have a grandmother living with us,"" he continues. ""Everyone needs practical guidance.""

Lesson 3: Admit the unknown

""Science is slow,"" says Gigi Gronvall, sitting at her desk one morning in front of the images that remind her of the knowledge and benefits a society can reap when scientific breakthroughs occur. ""But science is far more effective than jumping to conclusions.""

During the pandemic, with schools and businesses closed and loved ones getting sick and dying, ""no one wanted to wait for information or be told what they could and couldn't do,"" she says. ""No one liked the disciplinarian,"" and public health became an easy target.

According to a study by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, 57% of leaders of local health departments surveyed nationwide became targets of harassment between March 2020 and January 2021, with droves of practitioners opting to leave their positions. ""Constrained by poor infrastructure, politics, and the backlash of the public they aimed to protect, public health officials described grappling with personal and professional disillusionment, torn between what they felt they should do and their limited ability to pursue it,"" the study reports. ""For some, the conflict was untenable.""

Why did public health become the scapegoat of a nation on lockdown?

From Inglesby's perspective, the backlash stemmed partly from an over-reliance on the CDC to make decisions beyond the scope of its expertise. ""The CDC is full of talented scientists, but as a health research agency, it wasn't set up to respond 24/7 to questions from the government and policymakers about matters of logistics and economic and societal tradeoffs, such as whether to close schools and businesses and cancel events,"" he says. ""These are political and civil-society decisions that require a collaborative effort, with people representing various interests weighing in to determine the best course of action.""

Founded in 1946 to stop the spread of malaria, the CDC serves as the nation's leading public health agency, responsible for providing scientific guidance on the spread of infectious diseases. The Atlanta-based agency is staffed with epidemiologists, virologists, and other experts in disease control and prevention, not in areas like economic growth and K-12 education. When asked, in the summer of 2020, to provide guidance on the return to school for students and teachers, the CDC submitted a report to the Trump administration indicating that the move would pose risks to a country experiencing 40,000 to 100,000 new cases of COVID every day—and to a nation with an already-overwhelmed health system.

The administration pushed back on the report, and many blamed the CDC for keeping kids out of school. According to Inglesby, however, the CDC was simply doing what it was set up to do: offering guidance on the matter, as it relates to curtailing harm done by the virus. ""It became all too easy to blame [the agency] for a decision that needed experts in additional areas to weigh in,"" he says.

The backlash on public health also stemmed from the learning curve involved in combatting a wily new virus behaving in unpredictable ways, experts say. ""We didn't have all of the answers, and new scientific evidence was emerging all the time,"" Inglesby explains. ""A study would be completed or half-completed. A new variant would be identified, and the message to the public would change.""

One example: face masks.

Early in the pandemic, scarce information existed on whether masks could stave off COVID-19, so officials didn't suggest wearing them. That changed, however, as data revealed that masks slow down the disease transmission, leading the CDC to alter its guidance. ""Some political leaders and members of the public accused the CDC of reversing positions and [lacking competence],"" Inglesby says, referring to the allegations of ""flip-flopping"" that resounded nationwide. ""What was missing from the conversation, however, is that changes are inevitable in an agency devoted to scientific research—that's the nature of what researchers do."" They gather evidence and conduct studies, shifting recommendations as they narrow in on the truth.

How public health officials present information makes a difference, experts suggest. ""The public doesn't want to hear heavily scientific explanations, just as they don't want to be told everything will be OK, without any specifics,"" Inglesby says.

Gronvall recommends an approach comparable to a police chief speaking at a press briefing. ""The key is to strike a cadence that reinforces a message along the lines of, 'This is what we know right now, and it's why we recommend X precaution. When we learn more and if the guidance changes, we'll update you right away.'""

This way, the message comes across not as a command from all-knowing experts but as an open sharing of evidence-based information for people to use—or not use—to make decisions. The choice stays with the individual, who becomes an informed partner in protecting their health and that of their loved ones.

Lesson 4: Get ahead of misinformation

Tara Sell, a senior scholar at the Center for Health Security, specializes in misinformation—and its ability to turn people away from life-saving health advice. During the pandemic, she mined social media and networking forums for misleading posts about everything from face masks and social distancing to vaccines and anti-viral treatments.

""Misinformation eroded millions of people's trust in public health,"" Sell says. ""It will take a lot of work to rebuild it.""

From her research, she discovered that misinformation stemmed in part from partisan politics. ""Whether to wear a mask, whether to get a vaccine—those choices became tied to people's political identity, which wasn't good for the public and brought consequences that continue today,"" Sell says. Since the pandemic, for example, at least 30 states have passed laws to limit public health authority, and health officials in many of those states can no longer issue mask mandates or close schools.

Tara Sell Senior scholar, Center for Health Security ""Whether to wear a mask, whether to get a vaccine—those choices became tied to people's political identity, which wasn't good for the public and brought consequences that continue today.""

Gronvall says that partisan media outlets fueled misinformation by giving airtime to anchors who contradicted health guidance and sowed doubt among viewers. On Tucker Carlson Tonight, for instance, Carlson spoke out repeatedly against vaccines, going so far as to compare President Biden's vaccination plan to the lethal and torturous medical procedures imposed by the Nazis during the Holocaust. In 2021, he referred to the vaccine as ""the greatest scandal in my lifetime, by far,"" and openly discouraged his roughly 3 million viewers from getting vaccinated.

The media's influence on health compliance during the pandemic hasn't been thoroughly studied, Gronvall says, and she worries the breeding ground for misinformation still plagues us. ""As a society, we haven't addressed the financial forces that went into dismantling public health messages and dissuading people from protecting their own interests,"" she says.

Sell agrees, adding: ""Misinformation is a predictable part of health emergencies, so much so that we'll know what to look for the next time around.""

From her research, Sell noticed striking similarities among misinformation spread during COVID and other crises. For example, tales of infertility nearly always crop up, with reports of, say, a vaccine preventing women from conceiving or delivering a healthy baby. False claims abound about health treatments that use children as guinea pigs, along with conspiracy theories about a government's ill intentions or a pharmaceutical or tech company's financial greed.

Society's most susceptible members often fall prey to the messages. ""Pregnancy and early motherhood, for instance, are vulnerable times for women,"" Sell says. ""You've got a lot of things you don't know, and so you search the internet for information and find a lively audience talking about things that speak to your situation. You get hooked.""

To share what she learned, Sell and her colleagues worked with the CDC to produce a playbook for directors of local health departments to use to identify and address misinformation. The playbook includes instruction on things like how to address rumors, frame messages, and connect with communities to build trust and partnerships.

""As health scholars, we tend to look at situations through the lens of case numbers and infection rates, but other people's values also matter,"" she says. ""We need to step out of our bubbles. We need to listen with empathy.""

The next one

During the 1918 influenza pandemic, as the deadly disease ravaged one battalion after another on the battlefields of World War I, governments went to great lengths to hide the circumstances, fearing the news would lower morale and lead enemy forces to take advantage of the depleted troops.

In the U.S., President Woodrow Wilson signed into law the Espionage Act of 1917, preventing anyone from documenting or discussing anything that would disadvantage the country's military position. The following year, Wilson passed the Sedition Act, a more stringent measure that made it illegal—and punishable by a 20-year imprisonment—for anyone to write, publish, or utter a word that might hinder the U.S. war effort. This, of course, meant keeping quiet about the strange illness killing millions on U.S. soil and across the Atlantic.

Perhaps not surprisingly, Wilson's suppression of free speech fostered a breeding ground for misinformation about a virus that became known, incorrectly, as the ""Spanish flu."" A neutral country in World War I, Spain was among the only countries reporting deaths and illnesses caused by the virus. Word spread that the virus originated there.

Studies reveal that ""the 'Spanish flu' most likely started at a military camp in Kansas,"" says Gronvall, who teaches a class on the 1918 pandemic at the Bloomberg School of Public Health.

Gronvall says her students chime in regularly with stories about COVID—and similarities between the pandemic they experienced firsthand and the one they're learning about in class. She talks to students about rising threats like H5N1, a matter that weighs heavily on those at the Center for Health Security.

At the time of this writing, H5N1, a strain of influenza spread by wild birds and highly contagious and lethal in poultry, continues to wreak havoc on the U.S. poultry and cattle industries, having infected commercial and backyard poultry flocks in all 50 states and cattle herds in at least 16, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the CDC. Seventy humans have tested positive, including veterinarians and others with no known contact with infected cows or birds, ""which suggests we're missing cases,"" Gronvall says. Mammals are also contracting the disease, with H5N1 showing up in red foxes, racoons, bobcats, and even domestic cats, among other animals.

""I'm chronically worried,"" Inglesby says about H5N1. ""There's no evidence right now that it can spread from human to human but that could change in ways that allow it to transmit efficiently between people.""

If that happens, the outcome could be disastrous. ""The lethality of H5N1 infection in a new epidemic would depend on the exact strain, but in the past, there was very high lethality in humans infected with this virus,"" Inglesby explains.

Experts say that the U.S. needs to prepare not only for H5N1 but also for the slew of other infectious diseases with epidemic or pandemic potential. ""We live in an age of pandemics and have to count on an increase in infectious disease outbreaks,"" Inglesby says. ""We have to create [the infrastructure] to develop medicines and vaccines rapidly and surveillance systems that can make quick diagnoses.""

No such pandemic response system exists right now, and it can't happen by the hands of a single country—it requires a global effort, Inglesby indicates.

Since the bird flu broke out in the U.S. in 2022, world experts have been watching what many considered a lackluster response by the Biden administration to contain the disease. Diagnostic testing for H5N1 is in short supply, and in many states, testing cattle isn't mandatory. Infected but asymptomatic cattle can go unnoticed, and farmers who fear economic or other repercussions (roughly half of U.S. farmworkers are undocumented immigrants) may be reluctant to report sick cattle and unable to seek medical care if they fall ill themselves, owing to a lack of health insurance.

""The country needs to remove barriers that get in the way of farmers reporting illness or seeking help,"" Inglesby says. In 2024, the U.S. Department of Agriculture ""implemented a financial incentive for farmers who report illnesses. That's a step in the right direction.""

Still, the number of cattle and humans with H5N1 probably far surpasses the number of cases reported, Inglesby suspects. And the coordination it will take to combat a virus that affects both humans and animals is ""much more complicated than fighting COVID because of the collaboration it takes between the USDA and CDC,"" he says.

A vaccine for the strain of H5N1 running rampant across the U.S. doesn't yet exist, though pharmaceutical companies such as Moderna and Pfizer are working on it. Roughly five million doses of an older vaccine that targets other bird flu strains exist, but those haven't been made available to farmers, who face the most risk.

""Did we learn nothing from COVID?"" Gronvall wonders.

Right now, efforts are underway to restructure, shrink, and limit the powers of the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, the CDC, and practically all government agencies, with budget freezes halting medical research and public health initiatives. ""This is incredibly worrisome for several reasons,"" Inglesby says, ""including what it's doing to public health budgets at the state level, which rely on money from the CDC.""

Gronvall says the abrupt slashes to research and public health budgets, combined with cuts to services that advance and protect human health, are arriving as our country and world face an unprecedented health threat, with more to come.

""We don't know enough about H5N1 or other viruses with epidemic or pandemic potential, and we need to learn,"" she says, gesturing to the pair of images on the wall behind her, the two emblems of acumen gained through data collected and analyzed. ""The only way is through research.""

67|r/Pandemic|2025-04-19 18:45:07|https://sph.cuny.edu/life-at-sph/news/2024/01/11/universal-coronavirus-vaccine-could-save-billions-of-dollars/|Having a universal coronavirus vaccine that targets all coronaviruses in advance of the next coronavirus pandemic can save up to 7 million hospitalizations and 2 million deaths even when it is the only intervention being implemented and its efficacy is as low as 10%.|"A new study suggests once developed, having a universal vaccine in advance of the next coronavirus epidemic/pandemic can save up to 7 million hospitalizations and 2 million deaths even when it is the only intervention being implemented and its efficacy is as low as 10%.

What if scientists had developed a universal coronavirus vaccine in the years prior to 2020 so that it was available at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic? A universal coronavirus vaccine targets parts of the virus that are common to either many or all coronaviruses, thereby offering some degree of protection against a range of strains. A new study suggests if such a vaccine were available at the start of the pandemic, it could have saved millions of lives, prevented suffering, and saved billions of dollars in direct medical and other costs until the strain-specific (i.e., SARS-CoV-2) vaccine went through the entire development, testing, and emergency use authorization process that lasted 10 months.

In the study, researchers from the Public Health Informatics, Computational and Operations Research (PHICOR) group, the CUNY Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy (CUNY SPH), and the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) show that having a universal vaccine at the start of the pandemic would have had substantial health and economic benefits under almost all scenarios tested. The study was published Jan. 11 in the Lancet’s eClinicalMedicine.

In order to determine the value of investing in developing and stockpiling a universal coronavirus vaccine, the team developed a computational model that simulated the entire U.S. population, the introduction and spread of a novel coronavirus like SARS-CoV-2 in 2020 and the resulting health (e.g., infections, hospitalizations) and economic (e.g., direct medical costs, productivity losses) outcomes. The experiments simulated what would happen if a universal coronavirus vaccine was available at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Vaccinating with a universal coronavirus vaccine as a standalone intervention (e.g., no face mask use or social distancing) was cost-saving even when its efficacy was as low as 10% and only 10% of the U.S. population received the vaccine. For example, when a universal coronavirus vaccine has 10% efficacy, vaccinating a quarter of the U.S. population within two months of the start of the pandemic averts an average of 14.6 million infections and saves over $27 billion in direct medical costs. Such low vaccine coverage at the start of the pandemic could occur if a vaccine were only made available to certain high-risk subpopulations (e.g., 65 years and older, those with weakened immune systems, frontline workers), similar to the approach when mRNA vaccines became available in December 2020.

“COVID-19 was the third major and serious coronavirus epidemic or pandemic following SARS in 2002 and MERS in 2012, thus, we should anticipate a fourth coronavirus outbreak within the next decade or so,” says Peter J. Hotez, MD, PhD, dean of Baylor’s National School of Tropical Medicine and co-director of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development. “A universal vaccine is cost-effective and cost-saving and a priority for advancement.”

A universal coronavirus vaccine was also shown to be highly cost-effective even if a more specific and more efficacious vaccine came to market. For example, the study shows if it takes four months or longer for a strain-specific vaccine to reach the market, using a universal vaccine was still cost cost-saving. In a scenario where a strain-specific vaccine has 90% efficacy but is unavailable for two months after the start of the pandemic, the results from the model show that vaccinating only 10% of the population with a universal vaccine that has 10% efficacy at the start of the pandemic can save over $2 billion in societal costs (e.g., direct medical costs and productivity losses from absenteeism). Given the time required to develop a strain-specific vaccine during a pandemic to match circulating strains of the virus, this highlights the importance of having a universal vaccine readily available as a stopgap.

“Our study shows the importance of giving as many people as possible in a population at least some degree of immune protection as soon as possible,” explains Bruce Y. Lee, MD, MBA, executive director of PHICOR and professor at CUNY SPH. “Having a universal vaccine developed, stockpiled, and ready to go in the event of a pandemic could be a game-changer even if a more specific vaccine could be developed three to four months later.”

Generally, results from the model found that a universal vaccine would end up saving money if the cost to get a person vaccinated (e.g., cost of the vaccine itself, distribution, administration, storage, research, and development) is as high as $10,390 from a societal perspective.

The two-day simulation, Exercise Polaris, tested WHO’s Global Health Emergency Corps (GHEC), a framework designed to strengthen countries’ emergency workforce, coordinate the deployment of surge teams and experts, and enhance collaboration between countries.

The exercise simulated an outbreak of a fictional virus spreading across the world.

Participating countries included Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, Denmark, Ethiopia, Germany, Iraq, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Mozambique, Nepal, Pakistan, Qatar, Somalia Uganda and Ukraine, with additional countries as observers. Each country participated through its national health emergency coordination structure and worked under real-life conditions to share information, align policies and activate their response.

Regional and global health agencies and organizations, including Africa CDC, European CDC, IFRC, IOM, UNICEF and established emergency networks such as the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, the Emergency Medical Teams initiative, Stand-by partners and the International Association of National Public Health Institutes, worked together to support country-led responses. More than 350 health emergency experts connected globally through this exercise.

“This exercise proves that when countries lead and partners connect, the world is better prepared,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “No country can face the next pandemic alone. Exercise Polaris shows that global cooperation is not only possible – it is essential.”

Throughout the simulation, countries led their own response efforts while engaging with WHO for coordination, technical guidance and emergency support. The exercise provided a rare opportunity for governments to test preparedness in a realistic environment, one where trust and mutual accountability were as critical as speed and capacity.

“The exercise sought to put into practice the procedures for inter-agency response to international health threats. Efficient coordination and interoperability processes are key to guaranteeing timely interventions in health emergencies,” said Dr Mariela Marín, Vice Minister of Health of Costa Rica, thanking the Pan American Health Organization for their support and the members of the National Risk Management System for their engagement.

“Polaris demonstrated the critical importance of cultivating trust before a crisis occurs,” said Dr Soha Albayat from Qatar. “The foundation of our collaborative efforts is significantly stronger than in years past. We've moved beyond reactive measures, and are now proactively anticipating, aligning, and coordinating our cross-border emergency response plans.”

“The Global Health Emergency Corps has evolved into a powerful platform, building on practice, trust and connection,” said Dr Mike Ryan, Executive Director of WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme. “Exercise Polaris showed what is possible when countries operate with urgency and unity supported by well-connected partners. It is a strong signal that we are collectively more ready than we were.”

At a time when multilateralism is under pressure and preparedness is often framed through a national lens, Exercise Polaris reaffirmed that health is a global issue."|"The two-day simulation, Exercise Polaris, tested WHO’s Global Health Emergency Corps (GHEC), a framework designed to strengthen countries’ emergency workforce, coordinate the deployment of surge teams and experts, and enhance collaboration between countries.

Instead, all six flu pandemics that have occurred since 1889 emerged in spring and summer months. And that got some University of Texas at Austin scientists wondering, why is that?

Based on their computational model that mimics viral spread during flu season, graduate student Spencer Fox and his colleagues found strong evidence that the late timing of flu pandemics is caused by two opposing factors: Flu spreads best under winter environmental and social conditions. However, people who are infected by one flu virus can develop temporary immune protection against other flu viruses, slowing potential pandemics. Together, this leaves a narrow window toward the end of the flu season for new pandemics to emerge.

They report their findings today in PLOS Computational Biology.

Each of the six flu pandemics since 1889 emerged in the Northern Hemisphere after the flu season (dashed lines), rather than during the peak of flu season. An average of several flu seasons is represented by a curve, with a peak in activity typically between late December and early March. Spencer J. Fox

The researchers’ model assumes that people infected with seasonal flu gain long-term immunity to seasonal flu and short-term immunity to emerging pandemic viruses. The model incorporates data on flu transmission from the 2008-2009 flu season and correctly predicted the timing of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.

Using the supercomputers at the Texas Advanced Computing Center, the scientists used their model to run thousands of simulations in which new pandemic viruses emerged at different points throughout the flu season. They found that the combination of winter conditions and cross-virus immunity indeed led to spring and summer pandemics.

“We don’t know when or where the next deadly flu pandemic will arise,” says Lauren Ancel Meyers, a professor in the Department of Integrative Biology and principal investigator of the study. “However, the typical flu season leaves a wake of immunity that prevents new viruses from spreading. Our study shows that this creates a narrow, predictable window for pandemic emergence in the spring and early summer, which can help public health agencies to detect and respond to new viral threats.”

Future research may focus on more precisely characterizing the cross-strain immunity that impedes pandemic emergence during the normal flu season. Scientists may also explore how these pandemic risk patterns manifest in the Southern Hemisphere and tropical regions.

The charges carry potential sentences of more than a decade in prison.

The fraud scheme targeted two programs meant to feed hungry children, which were funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture but administered by the state of Minnesota. The system relied on nonprofit groups called “sponsors” to be its watchdogs. They were supposed to oversee individual kitchens and feeding sites and make sure they were not inflating the number of children they served.

When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, the federal government flooded money into the program — trying to reach children who were out of school and therefore unable to rely on school lunches. The government also relaxed oversight, putting even more trust in the watchdogs.

In this case, prosecutors said, one of those watchdogs went bad.

Ms. Bock ran a sponsor nonprofit called Feeding Our Future. Prosecutors said she had conspired with dozens of people to set up 250 nonexistent feeding operations around Minnesota and used her oversight power to hide that network from the government. By law, Ms. Bock’s nonprofit got a cut of the money. Prosecutors said it had eventually totaled $18 million.

Many of the fake operations submitted invoices for implausibly large numbers of children: Mr. Said’s operation, for instance, said it had fed 6,000 a day, more than all the children in its ZIP code. In another instance, a man said he was feeding 5,000 children a night — from a location that turned out to be a second-floor apartment."|"They were supposed to oversee individual kitchens and feeding sites and make sure they were not inflating the number of children they served.

74|r/Pandemic|2025-03-21 06:05:02|https://ourworldindata.org/historical-pandemics|What were the death tolls from pandemics in history?|"What were the death tolls from pandemics in history? Pandemics have killed millions of people throughout history. How many deaths were caused by different pandemics, and how have researchers estimated their death tolls?

COVID-19 has brought the reality of pandemics to the forefront of public consciousness. But pandemics have afflicted humanity for millennia. Time and again, people faced outbreaks of diseases — including influenza, cholera, bubonic plague, smallpox, and measles — that spread far and caused death and devastation.

Our ancestors were largely powerless against these diseases and unable to evaluate their true toll on the population. Without good record-keeping of the number of cases and deaths, the impact of outbreaks was underrecognized or even forgotten. The result is that we tend to underestimate the frequency and severity of pandemics in history.

Often, we have records of epidemics occurring in some countries but lack good records from other regions despite knowing that the geographical impact of the disease would have been very wide. Additionally, we often lack knowledge about which pathogens caused outbreaks and, thus, if a historical event can be considered a pandemic or if it consisted of parallel outbreaks of different diseases.

To deal with the lack of historical records on total death tolls, modern historians, epidemiologists, and demographic researchers have used various sources and methods to estimate their death tolls — such as using data from death records, tax registers, land use, archaeological records, epidemiological modeling, and more.

In this article, I present the various methods they rely on and visualize the estimated impact of what are now considered the major pandemics in history.

What is a pandemic?

Although there is no universally accepted definition of a pandemic1, diseases called pandemics share several characteristics.

Pandemics generally refer to diseases with a vast geographic range — such as spreading across a continent or multiple continents. In addition, they tend to describe outbreaks that are rapidly growing or expanding in range, highly infectious, affecting a large number of people, and caused by novel pathogens against which there is little or no pre-existing immunity.2

How do researchers estimate the death toll of pandemics?

Researchers have estimated the death tolls of pandemics in different ways, depending on the data available.

Some death tolls have been estimated by looking at excess deaths: researchers estimate the additional number of deaths that occurred during a pandemic compared to the expected number of deaths in a typical year. This can be helpful to understand the pandemic’s overall impact, even if records from death certificates are unavailable.

For some pandemics, death tolls are estimated from the net population reduction, where researchers calculate the difference in population size before and after the pandemic. This is often used for severe events — such as the Columbian Exchange — where a significant fraction of the population died.

Some death tolls have been estimated through epidemiological modeling — based on knowledge of the transmission of the disease and its geographical spread, its fatality rate (the share of people affected who die from it), access to treatment, and other types of data.

Finally, some death tolls have been calculated only using recorded deaths (also referred to as ‘confirmed deaths’). This is the number of deaths officially reported with the disease as their cause of death. This method may vastly underestimate the number of deaths caused by the pandemic, as comprehensive historical records are lacking. Even today, cause-of-death registration is lacking in many parts of the world, which is one reason why the number of confirmed deaths from COVID-19 is much lower than the total death toll from the pandemic.

A timeline of historical pandemics

I have brought together estimates of death tolls from different pandemics in history for this article, which we have visualized in a timeline below.

The size of each circle represents one pandemic’s estimated death toll. Pandemics without a known death toll are depicted with triangles.

This overview shows us the vast impact that pandemics have had over history.

You can see that the largest pandemics — such as the Black Death — killed more than half of the population. Several pandemics have swept through the population repeatedly: in just the last two hundred years, seven major pandemics were caused by cholera, and another seven were caused by the flu.

Pandemics devastated millions and left a shadow on those who survived. The suffering they caused may once have felt inescapable.

Before the formation of germ theory, we lacked good knowledge of pathogens that caused them, how they spread, and how to protect ourselves from them. Before molecular testing to analyze pathogens’ genomes, we lacked a good understanding of how they evolved and changed over time.

Our ability to respond to pandemics has been transformed by advances in scientific understanding but truly depends on a wide range of efforts — from data collection to research and communication, public health efforts, healthcare access, and cooperation.

For example, the collection of death records allowed scientists to discover how cholera spread and how to prevent it. Coordination to address HIV/AIDS has prevented millions of deaths worldwide. Global testing for new influenza strains has helped adapt flu vaccines each year.

With better understanding, resources, and effort, much more progress can be made. The world can respond more swiftly and effectively to pandemic risks and avoid and reduce the impact of future pandemics. But without such efforts, we will continue to face major pandemics as we have experienced so far.

Dataset and sources The full dataset and sources used in the chart can be found in our spreadsheet.

In the appendix below, I review some of the major pandemics in history and their historical impact and describe how their death tolls have been estimated.

Appendix: Major pandemics in the last millennium

The Black Death

The Black Death (1346–1353 CE) — one of the earliest pandemics with a methodically estimated death toll — killed around 50–60% of Europe’s population, approximately 50 million people, in just 6 years.3

Researchers have established that many people also died elsewhere — as large outbreaks are also recognizable in historical records from Western Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa — but comprehensive estimates of the global death toll are not available.

Population censuses were not conducted then, so our understanding of the Black Death’s impact in Europe comes from historical records such as tax and rent registers, parish records, and archeological remains. However, uncertainty remains, as these records come from a limited number of European regions and are extrapolated to the rest of the continent based on demographic estimates.

Careful examination of these sources has led to historians revising estimates of the death toll upwards4 and confirmed the bacterial cause of the pandemic: Yersinia pestis (Y. pestis).5

People in the fourteenth century were unaware of this bacterium, nor did they know how it was transmitted — from rat fleas to humans — as this was long before the development of germ theory in the late nineteenth century.6

Without this knowledge, they also had little understanding of how to protect themselves, resulting in the relentless spread of the Black Death. Even after its initial wave, the pandemic continued with frequent, though smaller outbreaks until around 1690.7

Y. pestis caused diseases known as “bubonic” and “pneumonic” plague, where patients experienced fevers, chills, vomiting, and excruciating headaches, and distinctive “buboes” formed in their swollen lymph nodes — typically in the groin, thighs, armpits, or neck.

As Y. pestis spreads through the lymph nodes, it emits toxins that break down blood vessels and form clots, potentially blocking blood circulation and leading to death.8

Other bubonic plague pandemics

It is now recognized that the Black Death was not the only plague caused by Y. pestis. Genetic evidence suggests that this bacteria emerged at least 4000 years ago.9

The first known bubonic plague pandemic began in 541 CE and had recurrent outbreaks until the mid-8th century. This devastating pandemic affected the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire), the Middle East, North Africa, and the Mediterranean.

The initial and most severe outbreak, known as the “Justinianic Plague” (541–549 CE), was named after Emperor Justinian, who ruled Constantinople then.10

The third pandemic occurred between 1894 and 1940, mainly affecting Asia and Africa.

Bubonic plague is less common today due to improved sanitation and hygiene measures which reduce the density of rats and rat fleas, improved public health surveillance, and effective antibiotics, but cases have been seen even in recent years in different continents, mainly in small towns and villages.11

The Columbian Exchange

The chart shows the immense impact of the “Columbian Exchange”, with an estimated 48 million deaths.

The Columbian Exchange describes the period following Christopher Columbus’s voyage to the Americas in 1492 — during which populations, ideas, and crops, such as tomatoes, potatoes, and maize, spread between the Americas and the rest of the world.

But the Columbian Exchange also involved extensive war, conquest, slavery, and the spread of multiple deadly diseases, which led to the devastation of indigenous populations.12

Smallpox, cholera, measles, diphtheria, influenza, typhoid fever, bubonic plague, and other diseases had already killed many in Europe. But they tended to be more severe to Native Americans, who had been previously isolated from these diseases and lacked immunity to them.

The immense death toll shown on the chart is calculated as a “net population reduction” compared to the pre-1492 population size.

The Native American population was estimated to be around 54 million before Columbus’s arrival. Over the following century, around 48 million died, and the population declined to 5.6 million in 1600 — a reduction of about 90%.

Both numbers are estimated by compiling data from a range of sources, including archeological records, tribal records, censuses, epidemiological modeling, and land and crop use.13

Influenza pandemics

Influenza (flu) pandemics arise through sudden evolutionary changes in flu viruses when different strains combine to form novel flu strains14, which can be more infectious and lethal than previous ones.

Although flu has affected humanity for thousands of years15, comprehensive death tolls have only been estimated for the flu pandemics in the last 140 years.

The largest — the 1918 “Spanish flu” pandemic — has an estimated death toll of 50 to 100 million.16 This estimate is a compilation of various historical sources, including recorded death tolls and estimates of excess deaths from different regions.

You can read more about the impact of the Spanish flu pandemic in our article:

The Spanish flu: the global impact of the largest influenza pandemic in history The Spanish flu pandemic had a devastating impact on the global population.

The chart also shows the estimated impact of other significant flu pandemics: the 1889 “Russian flu” pandemic (an estimated 4 million deaths), the 1957 “Asian flu” pandemic (2 million), the 1968 “Hong Kong flu” pandemic (2 million), and the 2009 “Swine flu” pandemic (100,000 to 1.9 million deaths).17

Their death tolls have been estimated from excess mortality during pandemics compared to the years immediately before and after, using available national mortality records and extrapolation to the global population.

Cholera pandemics

As the chart shows, seven cholera pandemics have occurred in the last two centuries.18 Most are considered to have originated in the Indian subcontinent and expanded across countries and continents through war, travel, and international trade.19

Our knowledge of the total global death toll from cholera in history is limited20, but historical reports from across the world suggest an immense impact of the disease. For example, between 1865 and 1947, at least 23 million people died from cholera in India alone.21 But significant outbreaks have been recorded in many more countries.22

Cholera is particularly severe because, if left untreated, the bacteria Vibrio cholerae can cause severe dehydration and death within hours or days of the first symptoms.23

Its severity has been reduced with a range of scientific advances: the understanding that cholera spread through contaminated water and food, and thus that clean water and sanitation could prevent it; the identification of Vibrio cholerae as the cause; the development of antibiotics; and the knowledge that severe forms of the disease could be substantially reduced with simple rehydration treatment.24

Cholera continues to kill, even today. Since 1960, over 900,000 deaths have been recorded from cholera globally as part of what’s considered the “seventh cholera pandemic” — this is shown in the chart.25

When HIV/AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) was first identified in the early 1980s, it had a fatality rate of 100%, and patients had a median survival time of about one year after being diagnosed.26 It spread rapidly as the world grappled with recognizing, understanding, and responding to the growing epidemic.

HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, attacks white blood cells — which are critical for our immune function — and leaves patients vulnerable to a wide range of opportunistic infections and diseases.

Learn more on our page on HIV/AIDS:

HIV / AIDS A global epidemic and the leading cause of death in some countries.

The timeline shows the enormous and continuing impact of HIV/AIDS, which has resulted in an estimated 33 million deaths worldwide between 1981 and 2022.

Our understanding of its death toll comes from available data and statistical modeling. The estimates consider various factors, such as characteristics of the virus’s transmission, behavioral and clinical data, the availability of treatment, and recorded deaths from countries with high levels of death registration. 27

The global response to HIV/AIDS has involved international cooperation, resource allocation, and scientific advances in antiretroviral therapy, which together have transformed HIV from a fatal diagnosis to a manageable chronic condition with treatment.

In recent years, around 1.5 million deaths have been averted annually due to the effects of antiretroviral therapy — which prevents the virus from replicating and thereby reduces the severity of the disease and its spread to other individuals.

This is shown in the chart below, along with the estimated number of HIV/AIDS deaths that still occur — around 600,000 deaths annually in recent years.

The COVID-19 pandemic was caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which emerged at the end of 2019 and rapidly evolved into a global health emergency. Characterized by its highly infectious nature and severe respiratory symptoms, COVID-19 has led to widespread illness and fatalities across the world.

The timeline above shows the vast global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic — with around 27 million excess deaths between January 2020 and November 2023.28 This makes it one of the deadliest pandemics of the last century.

COVID-19’s death toll has been measured by excess mortality, which describes the number of deaths above what would have been expected based on previous years.

This method is used because the global number of confirmed deaths from COVID-19 (those where COVID-19 is listed as the cause of death) is certainly much lower than the total number of deaths from COVID-19. This is because, in many countries, testing for COVID was very limited throughout the pandemic, and cause-of-death registration was, and still is, lacking in many countries.29

Excess mortality also has the advantage of not only considering deaths directly caused by the virus but also those indirectly caused by the pandemic’s impact on healthcare systems and economies.

Learn more about excess mortality here:

Excess mortality during the Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19)

To estimate excess mortality, researchers use national mortality data from countries where data is available and statistical models — which rely on data on COVID-19 testing rates, confirmed cases and deaths, population age structure, state policies, and more — for other countries.

The estimated death toll we show for COVID-19 — 27 million deaths by November 2023 — comes from The Economist. The main reasons why I am relying on The Economist’s estimates are that they are continuously updated, and their methodology is well documented.

In contrast, while the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) have also estimated the number of excess deaths, their latest estimates were only based on the time period until the end of 2021. For this time period, all three sources provide similar estimates (18.2 million deaths were estimated by the IHME; 14.8 million deaths were estimated by the WHO; and 17.8 million deaths were estimated by The Economist).30

The chart below shows the excess mortality during COVID-19, as estimated by The Economist, along with the number of confirmed deaths. As you can see, there is wide uncertainty around the total number of excess deaths during the pandemic. However, even the lowest estimates are much higher than the number of confirmed deaths — reflecting the limited amount of testing and death registration globally during the pandemic.

Among the most challenging tasks was the development of a prioritized list detailing supplies and the essential quantities that should be stockpiled. This report aims to provide detailed example of 1 healthcare system’s approach to building a cache of supplies for the next influenza pandemic and to help identify critical gaps in knowledge that must be addressed for adequate preparedness.

In December 2005, the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), which has governance over the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States, directed its medical centers to make detailed pandemic influenza preparations. This directive was ushered in by a guidance document ( 7 ) that broadly defined the goals and expectations of individual VA medical centers and provided a framework for planning and preparedness. Steps taken by medical centers, including decisions about stockpiling items, were determined by leaders at the local level.

Numerous guidance documents call for stockpiling certain supplies that might be needed to care for influenza patients during a pandemic ( 3 – 6 ). Just-in-time supply chains and standard operating procedures may be insufficient to meet demand as the number of cases increase ( 3 – 6 ). Healthcare systems have been challenged to determine the medical supplies that should be procured. Despite publication of numerous pandemic planning recommendations, little or no guidance has been available about this topic.

Preparations for the next influenza pandemic have captured a remarkable amount of attention, effort, and fiscal funding since 2004, when the scientific and public health communities became increasingly concerned about the emergence of a novel influenza virus (H5N1) infecting humans in Eurasia ( 1 ). Many feared the occurrence of an outbreak on the scale of the 1918–19 pandemic, during which one third of the world’s population became infected and as many as 100 million persons died ( 2 )

Many items purchased for the cache had expiration dates. Although most items had multiple-year shelf lives, some shelf lives were as short as 1 year. The variability of manufacturer-ascribed expiration dates and other reasons for supply rotation led to the recognition that the cache would become a dynamic component of medical system supplies. Items would need to be inspected regularly and rotated through the storage facility on a regular basis. To meet this need, a human resource commitment of 1 full-time employee equivalent would be necessary for logistics management of the inventory. Duties of this person would include inspecting the inventory, assisting with incoming and outgoing deliveries, rotating items into the routinely used supplies of the medical system to ensure use before expiration, and prodding physical security for the inventory. This person would also be charged with developing and maintaining a plan for transportation and deployment of the inventory in the event of a pandemic. In addition, each medical facility would also be required to provide an employee to help manage the inventory and who would report to the cache in the event of a pandemic.

Storage of supplies proved to be among the most resource-intensive components of cache-building. Although initial wishes were to store a cache on the campus of each medical center, the space necessary was too large for most VA institutions to accommodate. After extensive discussion and careful analysis of options, a decision was made to store pandemic supplies in a 10,000–square foot, temperature-controlled, leased warehouse. Quoted costs for space ranged from $10 to $14 per square foot per year ($100,000–$140,000 per year for 10,000 square feet). The recommended location was near an airport to ensure efficient transport of supplies either by tractor trailer or by air cargo. A back-up emergency generator was included to maintain air-conditioning in the event of a power failure.

Purchasing items in large quantity through a prenegotiated agreement enabled a discount off retail prices. However, despite this contract, back-order delays occurred (and would be expected to occur during a pandemic) for several key items. One supplier of personal protective equipment indicated that shipment would be delayed by 6–9 months, affirming predictions of shortages of personal protective equipment. This experience underscored making purchases well in advance of the date when the items were expected to be used for patient care.

The calculated cost of purchasing all essential items for a population of 500,000 amounted to ≈$11 million. Despite efforts to prioritize the items into 3 categories, the calculated cost of category A items far exceeded the amount of funds available. The PIPC debated the best approach and recommended that the available funds be used to purchase a percentage of category A items and that future funds would be used to purchase additional category A items and decreasing percentages of category B and category C items. For example, the funds available at that time were sufficient to purchase 12.5% of category A items. Upon the availability of future funding, perhaps an additional 7.5% of category A items would be purchased along with 5% of category B items and 2.5% of category C items.

Because limited financial resources were available, the PIPC was asked to establish a prioritization scheme. Although every item on the list was considered important, each was subcategorized into purchase priority A, B, and C; A was the most important ( Table 5 ). To arrive at the category level, the following scheme was used. Category A was personal protective equipment, basic life-support items (intravenous fluids, oxygen), and first-line antimicrobial drugs. Category B was second-line antimicrobial drugs, ventilator supplies, sedatives, nebulizers and β-agonists, home care packs, and morgue packs. Category C was disposable ventilators, proton pump inhibitors, and vasopressors. Antiviral medications and vaccines were not included in this list because it was expected that the VA would acquire and maintain a centralized cache of oseltamivir, and vaccine availability and effectiveness were unknown.

We estimated the per patient–encounter needs by staff category ( Table 3 ) and the number of healthcare worker contacts per patient, per day, for each type of healthcare setting ( Table 4 ). In a similar fashion, supply needs were estimated per patient encounter (for outpatients) or per patient-day of care (for inpatients) ( Table 3 ). The ascertained supply and medication needs were combined in a spreadsheet to estimate the needs of each facility and for our network. Spreadsheet formulas enabled the needs of each facility or healthcare system to be easily modified by using the number of individually enrolled patients ( Table 5 ).

Among the gaps in knowledge regarding pandemic influenza is the mechanism of human-to-human transmission of influenza ( 10 ). The Institute of Medicine recommendation ( 10 ) to consider all transmission routes probable and consequential was accepted. Precautions against standard, contact, droplet, and airborne transmission ( 13 ) were incorporated into the plan. We assumed that sole use of disposable N95 respirators would be prohibitively expensive or otherwise not possible because of global shortages ( 14 ). Instead, we decided that staff with prolonged periods of exposure (e.g., physicians, nurses, respiratory technicians, selected housekeepers) would be issued and that just-in-time fit testing, a reusable elastomeric half-face mask with 3 sets of filters, would be used. We estimated that we would need ≈1,000 of these masks and reusable goggles for each 50,000 patients served (on the basis of the size and catchment population of one of our medium-size facilities). Disposable masks would be limited to the beginning of the pandemic and to personnel with infrequent exposure. Using these principles, we calculated the workload, supplies, and medication required to care for typical influenza patients. Accordingly, estimates were produced for the average needs of influenza patients requiring >1 types of services, including outpatient, inpatient medical ward, or ICU settings with or without mechanical ventilation.

Length-of-stay figures were needed to calculate supply needs because resource use is more accurately calculated by patient-days of care instead of number of admissions. We used some of the assumptions made by FluSurge version 2.0 as follows: average length of stay (not in ICU) of 5 days per patient, an additional 10 days for those requiring an ICU stay, and an average time receiving mechanical ventilation of 10 days.

Once the number of patients was established, we used the US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) 1918-scale pandemic model ( 11 ) ( Table 2 ) and FluSurge version 2.0 software ( 12 ) ( Table 2 ) to estimate the number of persons who would be expected to seek care, be hospitalized, admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), or be treated with mechanical ventilation ( Table 2 ). The only modification to the DHHS model was in the proportion of the population likely to contract influenza. The model calls for 40% disease incidence for children, 20% for healthy adults, and a somewhat higher incidence for elderly persons. Therefore, 25% seemed like a reasonable number for the VA, an institution that does not provide healthcare to children. We based calculations on the population likely to request care, not on the physical or personnel capacity of our facilities. It was our assertion that physical capacity would be increased and standards of healthcare would be lowered, as necessary, during a pandemic to permit serving as many people as possible. We acknowledge that alternate sites of care might become available during a pandemic. However, we viewed this possibility as too unpredictable to include in our assumption model.

Most tools estimate effect on healthcare facilities based on population size, but we were dealing with a subpopulation of veterans that may seek care at the VA facilities or at any other community resource. In addition, VA facilities may open their doors to nonveterans during a pandemic. We decided, arbitrarily, to define our universe of patients as the number of individually enrolled persons who sought care at VA facilities during the previous fiscal year. This figure enabled us to calculate system and facility needs in a standardized fashion.

PIPC members recognized that the uncertainty surrounding a pandemic would require a series of assumptions and that any assumption would include some guesswork. To minimize errors, available historical data and guidance from governmental institutions were used to estimate the effect on our healthcare system.

The PIPC agreed on a set of basic philosophical principles that guided our pandemic preparation efforts. During a pandemic, the first priority would be to provide the best possible care to patients while maximizing healthcare worker safety. Essential and relatively affordable patient care supplies and medications meant for basic life support (e.g., intravenous fluids, oxygen, and antimicrobial drugs) would be purchased first, and more expensive, technologically advanced life support (e.g., mechanical ventilation) equipment would be purchased when additional funds become available. This approach to balancing utilitarian and deontologic decision making is discussed elsewhere ( 8 , 9 ). Vaccines and antiviral drugs would not be relied upon as primary means of intervention because their availability and effectiveness during a pandemic remain uncertain ( 4 , 10 ). Although plans to acquire, store, distribute, and administer these countermeasure supplies would be made when possible and necessary, we acknowledge that these plans would not be relied upon as primary countermeasures in most pandemic scenarios.

The VISN 8 leadership appointed a multidisciplinary team to a pandemic influenza planning committee (PIPC) ( Table 1 ) that was tasked to ensure a coordinated and consistent planning and response effort across the VISN. Although the committee had many responsibilities, the focus of this report is limited to the framework developed to estimate supply needs.

The 1,400 medical facilities in the national VA healthcare system are decentralized into 23 Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs), each representing a specific region of the nation. The concepts described in this report are based on actions taken by staff in VISN 8, which includes southern Georgia, most of Florida, and all of Puerto Rico, and provides healthcare for ≈500,000 veterans. Regional network offices help integrate the activities of the medical facilities included in each VISN. Local medical center leaders are primarily responsible for the activities at each hospital and its affiliated outpatient clinics.

Discussion and Recommendations

Despite the numerous uncertainties posed by pandemic influenza, the types and quantities of essential items that should be stockpiled can be estimated by using a reasoned approach. What is offered in this report is a method to calculate the components of a stockpile by using assumptions that are drawn from previous pandemics. This method enables modification of figures, making them scalable and adaptable to any size population. By following the logic of the proposed calculations, it should be possible to modify the assumptions and other figures as needed for almost any community or healthcare system.

Perhaps the most important limitation with this method is a reliance on assumptions. No one knows what the next pandemic will bring. We believe that it is better to plan for a more severe event that will leave the system overprepared than to risk being underprepared. However, this approach may be viewed by some as unnecessary or too expensive. A stratified purchase plan, in which a fraction of essential items is purchased periodically, is recommended on the basis of availability of funds. Some may favor purchase of all items in 1 category before moving to the next category.

The formation and management of a pandemic supply cache would require considerable human and financial resources. The level of commitment may be viewed by some healthcare systems as too costly, especially in an era of economic instability and healthcare system instability likely requiring major reform. Some of the more resource-intensive components of the proposed approach, such as the storage of items in a staffed central facility, were facilitated by the large size of our healthcare system and available resources. Achieving a similar product in the private sector, where healthcare systems are typically much smaller than those in the federally managed VA, might require a partnership among multiple healthcare systems in a region.

One of the most common and widely held misconceptions we encountered was the notion that a healthcare system could be stressed to the breaking point, such that a large surge of patients could eventually render a hospital unable to function. It is our view that in reality, healthcare systems are designed to operate in a graded fashion. Although it is theoretically conceivable that a catastrophe could cause hospitals to cease functioning, it is much more likely that they will continue functioning, even under the most ominous circumstances (15–17). What will change is the standard of care that is delivered; many patients may have access to less resources than would normally be available (18,19). Stockpiling supplies should help prepare for a downgraded level of care that becomes inevitable as resources are increasingly stretched. A key message taken from our experiences was that supplies need to be ordered far in advance of a pandemic to avoid major problems with back orders and supply shortfalls.

The estimated cost of purchasing all supplies and medications needed to provide healthcare to a population of 500,000 during a wave of an influenza pandemic, including negotiated and contracted prices, was ≈$11 million, or approximately half that amount if one only considers purchasing priority A items. This amount is considerably higher than the amount estimated elsewhere (20). This difference may stem from the way we calculated our needs: we did not assume that we could reach a full capacity. Instead, we attempted to estimate the population that is likely to seek care and assumed that under the dire circumstances of a severe pandemic facilities would decrease standards of care, open alternate sites of care, and creatively care for those patients who came for treatment. We also did not assume that we would have a shortage of personnel to care for these patients. Through altered standards of care; emergency privileging and cross-training of healthcare workers, volunteers, and other persons willing and able to care for our patients, a temporary and substantially changed workforce would be expected to emerge.

Numerous gaps in knowledge were encountered. The mechanisms of human-to-human transmission of seasonal and pandemic influenza are poorly understood. Numerous articles have discussed the types of respiratory protection that should be considered and stockpiled (6,10) for healthcare workers. However, there has never been a definitive, prospective clinical trial that shows whether respirators are superior to surgical masks. Translational research funding to answer these questions should become a priority.

This report is an attempt to describe the challenges our healthcare system faced when preparing for an influenza pandemic. By no means are all the answers, or even the questions, reported here. Additional work is needed to further identify important questions and appropriate solutions. We hope these concepts will help guide the decisions of other healthcare systems as they work through this challenging task."|"Numerous guidance documents call for stockpiling certain supplies that might be needed to care for influenza patients during a pandemic ( 3 – 6 ).

Bird flu has affected dairy herds in 17 US states from North Carolina to California and has just been reported in cats. So far, it is reluctant to spread among people, although people can both get it and give it to animals.

Between 500 and 1,000 people globally are now dying every week from COVID. This winter, healthcare in much of the developed world has been hit by a combination of flu, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and COVID, leading to rising hospital admissions and deaths. We don’t have real control of any of these diseases.

In the last 60 years there have been four pandemics – a million dead from flu in 1968-69; 774 people dead from Sars-1 in 2002; 7 million dead from COVID since 2021; 280 dead from mpox since 2022.

I’m not sure we are more ready for the next pandemic.

We are not controlling the diseases we can control. There have been cases of polio in children in Gaza and in young adults in New York. This is a disease that was nearly eliminated from the world.

Children are hospitalised with measles every day in wealthy countries. Many are very ill, some are left with brain damage and some die. Measles also came close to extinction but came back as vaccination rates fell.

Cotton Mather (a Puritan cleric) and Lady Mary Wortley Montagu introduced smallpox variolation (an early, crude form of vaccination) to the west in 1721.

The practice attracted controversy because of its danger and the immorality of deliberately infecting people. Anti-vaccination arguments have continued to run ahead of the evidence of benefit ever since. Partly as a result, we have not yet controlled measles or polio.

There are vaccine side-effects, but these are much rarer and much less serious than those from the diseases. Vaccine safety is closely monitored and for good reasons – vaccines are given to people who are not ill.

Other simple measures were described by US Supreme Court justice Samuel Alito in 2020 as “previously unimaginable restrictions on individual liberty”.

There were cases during the peak of the COVID pandemic, where people who wore masks in public were harassed. Lockdowns and other restrictions on mobility were much more intrusive, but there is clear evidence that both worked and people and economies benefited as a result.

Public health measures did control Sars-1, mainly because governments, public health teams and doctors got on top of it very quickly. They used the same approaches that have been used to control other severe outbreaks, including strong restrictions on movement.

Neither mpox nor COVID was controlled. In both cases, global responses were late, underfunded and slow and became the target of political attacks. In the case of mpox, it was initially thought, wrongly, only to affect gay men, and hence of limited significance to others. As a result, not enough was done to halt its spread early in the outbreak.

Many unscrupulous people took advantage of the COVID pandemic, selling useless remedies for the condition, such as bleach, hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin.

There were also campaigns promoting conspiracy theories about the origin of the virus, such as suggesting a deliberate release of an engineered virus, the purposes of the public health measures and the effects of the vaccine.

This made it very hard to deliver serious public health messages and interventions, especially to marginalised groups such as immigrants, poorer people or people with literacy challenges.

Experts are planning for pandemic bird flu, which may happen, but I fear that the next big one will be a virus we have yet to meet. It is critical that we have flexible plans to deal with something besides flu. Unfortunately, a combination of war and toxic politics is reducing our ability to develop and deliver these plans.

To deliver anything effectively, we need to strengthen global public health, including the World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which are both under severe threat to their future funding, as the US shrinks and rearranges its own agencies, and with Argentina’s plans to leave WHO.

Grounds for hope

There are grounds for hope. One remarkable outcome of the COVID pandemic was the vaccines. Most people in public health and vaccine studies thought it would be three years, at best, before a vaccine became available. It will be crucial to maintain the research base and the tools for fairer mass production of new vaccines for whatever happens next.

Two innovative UK studies – Recover and React – also showed a way forward for future pandemics. Recover provided a frame for doing quick drug trials on sick people, including finding that a cheap, safe medicine called dexamethasone worked to treat severe COVID, and provides a model for future clinical care for new infections.

React monitored the spread of the disease and its effects on UK communities. We need to maintain this capacity for smart, focused and timely innovation so we can quickly respond to whatever nature throws at us.

Most of all, we need politicians who will lead by example, giving clear messages about vaccines and other public health measures. We need a global understanding that if I have an infectious disease, that puts you and your family or country at risk. The virus does not care where you were born, what you believe in, or your political views.

In brief, we have the tools, the skills and the people to respond effectively to another pandemic. The outcomes of COVID and mpox were poor. Unless we improve delivery and leadership, we will fail to control the next pandemic too.

If we look at ourselves as a virus sees us, nothing more than tools for making more viruses, perhaps we can learn a bit of humility and get ready, together, for the next one."|"There were cases during the peak of the COVID pandemic, where people who wore masks in public were harassed.

Since then, things have gotten better, with new vaccines, therapies and a greater understanding of how the virus is spread. While COVID is still with us, we now regard it as a manageable disease. But as the current avian flu outbreak reminds us, the risk for a new pandemic is always present. UC Davis Health Chief of Infectious Diseases Stuart Cohen shares what lessons COVID has taught us that will help us better respond next time.

Surveillance and sharing information

As COVID recedes in our collective worries, we in the scientific and medical communities know that there inevitably will be another pandemic someday. According to the Center for Global Development, the annual likelihood of a pandemic is 2–3%, which means a 47–57% probability of another deadly pandemic in the next 25 years. Luckily, COVID taught us some lessons that — if we heed them — will help us deal with the next pandemic.

First, COVID pointed out the importance of early identification and warning systems. In late 2019, people involved in pandemic preparedness knew something was lurking in Asia and were worried. Chances are that the next pandemic will also be a zoonotic disease — that is, something that jumps from animals to humans.

Since I started working in Infectious Diseases in 1981, we’ve seen HIV/AIDS, Ebola, SARS, MERS, the H1N1 flu and now COVID-19, all of which were zoonotic in origin. Except for HIV, they’re all transmitted via the airborne or droplet route, so they spread from person to person more easily.

We need surveillance systems that can identify these species jumps at an early stage and warn people that a potential health threat is coming.

Cooperation between veterinarians and physicians who work in human medicine is extremely important. That’s something we do well at UC Davis. Between our School of Veterinary Medicine and our School of Medicine, we have a highly collaborative, cohesive group working on pandemic preparedness.

Combating the next pandemic will be a team sport. It will take the combined efforts of the medical and science communities and the public to save lives and deal with the pandemic that comes next. — Stuart Cohen, chief of infectious diseases

Developing tests quickly

Second, thanks to COVID, we also know the importance of speedily developing diagnostic tests — and making them quickly and widely available. During the early days of COVID-19, we were behind the eight ball because the test rollout was so slow. Once we got tests into laboratories the turnaround time for a result was slow and we didn’t have enough spare tests to do surveillance to figure out how far the disease had spread. That’s an area that must improve before the next pandemic hits.

This means more and better collaboration between academia and the diagnostics companies. More government funding would also be helpful for development of technology that is easily adaptable to identification of a new pathogen.

Read about how UC Davis developed its own COVID test in 19 days.

Treatment and prevention

Third, we will need to quickly develop treatments and prevention strategies. When AIDS first appeared in the early 1980s, we went almost two years before we knew what caused the disease, another year and a half until there was a diagnostic test, and decades until effective treatments and preventive drugs were developed.

Science is much faster now. With COVID, we saw how the mRNA platforms enabled industry to develop vaccines. Those platforms are adaptable and flexible and will be key in dealing with the next pandemic. Drug development also occurred at an expeditious pace, initially focused on treating the sickest patients but later for those who were not as severely ill but had the risk of progressing.

‘A team sport’

Finally, to fight the next pandemic, we will have to enlist and engage the public. If there’s one thing COVID taught us, it’s that everyone needs to be part of the solution. Misinformation and mistrust made fighting COVID more difficult than it needed to be.

The scientific community definitely made some missteps during COVID. With a new disease, you can’t know everything about it. We in the science world have to be transparent about what we know and what we are still learning. Transparency helps increase scientists’ credibility and keeps people engaged.

Knowledge is power. During the pandemic, I participated in livestreamed public town halls with Olivia Kasirye, the public health officer for Sacramento County. Members of the public got to ask questions — and they were good questions. People came up to me afterward and said they really appreciated the information we brought to them.

Combating the next pandemic will be a team sport. It will take the combined efforts of the medical and science communities and the public to save lives and deal with the pandemic that comes next.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Most of the 80,000 federal workers responsible for researching diseases, inspecting food and administering Medicare and Medicaid under the auspices of the Health and Human Services Department were emailed an offer to leave their job for as much as a $25,000 payment as part of President Donald Trump’s government cuts.

Workers cannot start opting in until Monday and have until 5 p.m. on Friday to submit a response for the so-called voluntary separation offer. The email was sent to staff across the department, which includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, and the National Institutes of Health as well as the Food and Drug Administration, both in Maryland.

The mass email went out to a “broad population of HHS employees,” landing in their inboxes days before agency heads are due to offer plans for shrinking their workforces. HHS is one of the government’s costliest federal agencies, with an annual budget of about $1.7 trillion that is mostly spent on health care coverage for millions of people enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid.

The agency oversees health insurance for roughly half the country through Medicare for older adults and Medicaid for disabled and poor Americans.

There was no immediate comment Sunday from HHS.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump’s health secretary, has hinted at plans at deep cuts to the staff. Last year, he promised to immediately clear out 600 employees at the NIH, the nation’s biomedical research arm. He has not gone that far, but in an interview last month shortly after being sworn in last month, Kennedy said he wanted to remove some workers from the public health agencies.

“I have a list in my head,” Kennedy said of potential firings at the agency. He said some workers “made really bad decisions” on nutrition guidelines.

The Trump administration, with the help of billionaire Elon Musk, has been trying to push out federal workers in an effort to cut costs. In January, most federal employees received a deferred resignation offer that came with eight months of pay. Thousands of probationary employees, too, have been fired across federal agencies, including at HHS.

The latest move to reduce the number of federal health workers comes as the the CDC is assisting with a deadly measles outbreak in West Texas and New Mexico and as lawmakers are debating deep cuts to Medicaid in the federal budget.

Monitoring efforts can either target a specific pathogen or a priority list of pathogens, such as those identified by the World Health Organization R&D Blueprint, or search for new pathogens using untargeted metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing11,27. Each of these strategies can be incorporated into our framework following model adjustment. In this study, we focus on the example of detecting SARS-CoV-2 variants using reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction, with positive samples undergoing whole-genome sequencing to identify specific variants.

We start our analysis by considering a baseline aircraft WWSN with 20 sentinel sites. To achieve sufficient regional coverage, we selected the three busiest international airports from each of the six World Health Organization regions and added two additional sites in South America and Oceania. The locations are shown, by airport markers, in Fig. 1 and are reported in Supplementary Table 6. We show in Supplementary Fig. 14 that selection of less busy airports generally delays disease detection, because larger international hubs offer broader coverage and more frequent flight connections, enabling faster detection.

The efficiency of the WWSN depends on the pathogen’s intrinsic characteristics, its detectability and the fraction of aircraft tested at sentinel sites. Here we consider a SARS-CoV-2-like respiratory infection with a wastewater detectability period consistent with reported values in the literature6,28,29. We map an individual’s disease history to a susceptible–latent–detectable–recovered (SLDR) compartmental structure, as shown in Fig. 1a. Susceptible (S) individuals can become infected through exposure to infectious individuals. Latent (L) individuals have been exposed but are not yet transmitting the pathogen and remain undetectable in the wastewater. Detectable (D) individuals include both infectious (I) individuals who can transmit the pathogen and postinfectious (P) individuals who no longer infect others but are still detectable through wastewater. Finally, recovered (R) individuals are no longer detectable and cannot be reinfected (Methods and Supplementary Information 1).

Each traveling detectable individual arriving at a sentinel on an international flight is detected with probability p det . The detection rate, p det , combines the fraction of sampled aircraft, the probability an individual uses the lavatory during a flight and the probability that a detectable individual is shedding sufficient virus to lead to a detection. Because current detectability estimates for SARS-CoV-2 in aircraft wastewater vary considerably10,12,19, our analysis varies p det from 4 to 32%. This variation in probability accounts for different estimates of detectability in the wastewater and different fractions of flights tested (Methods includes a detailed discussion). While sampling of individual aircraft independently maximizes detection accuracy, testing combined wastewater at a consolidation point, such as an airport triturator, may be more cost effective. Thus we assume pooled sampling, in which multiple detectable individuals traveling through the same sentinel on the same day result in a single detection, producing binary detection time series as shown in Fig. 1a. It is worth noting that most of these assumptions can be adjusted to accommodate alternative detection schemes, sampling cadences and sentinel site locations.

Baseline WWSN performance

A key metric for evaluating the effectiveness of a WWSN is the time to first detection of an emerging pathogen. This metric measures the number of days from an outbreak onset to the first detection at any sentinel. We simulate an epidemic seeded in one subpopulation with ten latent and ten infectious individuals. The time to first detection depends on the WWSN configuration, outbreak origin, pathogen traits, p det and stochastic variations in travel and detection events.

In Fig. 1b, we show the full probability distribution for the time to first detection for four different origins: Geneva (Switzerland), São Paulo (Brazil), Kotabaru (Indonesia) and Kalemie (Democratic Republic of the Congo). The time to first detection varies widely, from a mean of 14.2 days (90% PI, 4–22) for Geneva to 66.5 days (90% PI, 53–76) for Kalemie, where PI is central prediction interval (5th–95th percentiles). For assessment of WWSN performance globally, we calculate the mean time to first detection, T fd , for each of the >3,200 subpopulations in the model (Fig. 1c). A notable aspect is the important spatial variability of T fd based on the epidemic’s origin. For certain locations in Central Africa, T fd is in the order of 100 days, while for many places in Europe, 15–25 days is more typical. While Fig. 2 shows that detection of epidemics emerging from some continents takes, on average, more time than for others, we also note an important heterogeneity within continents (Extended Data Table 1). For instance, in Africa, the 90% PI of T fd ranges from 23 to 71 days. Zooming in at the level of statistical subregions, as defined by the United Nations geoscheme (Supplementary Fig. 6), we still find broad distributions of T fd for all subregions. Middle Africa, for instance, is very dispersed, with 90% PI ranging from 28.2 to 84.5 days. This result indicates that, across regions and scales, there exist blind spots where detection of epidemics would take much longer if they were the source. Blind spots in the WWSN are partly due to low per-capita travel volume, as shown by the strong inverse correlation between international travel volume and T fd (Supplementary Fig. 8). However, in some cases, detection at sentinel sites relies on importations from secondary outbreak locations with community transmission. This indirect path to reaching a sentinel further increases detection time from specific locations.

Fig. 2: Heterogeneity of T fd within geographical regions. We aggregate T fd obtained from Fig. 1 over continents (South America, n = 297; Africa, n = 338; Asia, n = 867; North America, n = 854; Europe, n = 596; Oceania, n = 292). Boxplots show the median (center line), interquartile range (box), 90% central PI (whiskers, 5th–95th percentile) and outliers outside the interval (black dots). Numerical values for some statistics of T fd are reported in Extended Data Table 1. Source data Full size image

In Figs. 1 and 2, we assume that p det in the WWSN is 16% and is uniform across all 20 sentinels. This probability of detection amounts to sampling from about 50% of international inbound flights, depending on the estimates for lavatory use and detectable shedding in fecal matter (Methods). In Supplementary Fig. 4, we report additional results for p det as low as 4%, thus assuming a fraction of flights sampled in the range 12–25%. The aforementioned heterogeneity of T fd persists across the full range of p det .

While our analysis focuses on T fd for situational awareness, the effectiveness of an outbreak response also depends on both outbreak size and the number of infections already dispersed internationally, along with their potential for cryptic transmission. To address these factors, we provide in Fig. 3 modeling estimates of both the number of infectious individuals at the source and the number of internationally dispersed infections at the time of first detection by the global WWSN (Supplementary Information 3). In Fig. 3a,b, it is evident that a longer T fd is strongly associated with a larger outbreak in the country of origin (Pearson’s r = 0.906, two-sided P = 1.4 × 10−6). It is worth noting that our analysis assumes unmitigated scenarios until detection, although large outbreaks would probably be identified earlier at the source, triggering mitigation policies. Interestingly, the number of international introductions at the time of first detection remains relatively stable, typically within the range of a few dozen infected individuals (Fig. 3c,d). This quantity does not exhibit a statistically significant association with T fd (Pearson’s r = 0.289, two-sided P = 0.277). Regardless of the outbreak’s origin, the WWSN detects the pathogen after a similar number of infections have spread internationally. This suggests that a global WWSN would provide early situational awareness for international public health responses, despite variability in detection time and local outbreak size.

Effects of pathogen characteristics on the WWSN

Although the model is designed to accommodate any specific pathogen and its shedding mechanisms, it is important to note that the natural history of a disease, particularly its key characteristic times and \(\mathcal{R}_0\), considerably impacts T fd . In Fig. 4a, we show how the global distribution of T fd , aggregated over all locations, changes with variation in \(\mathcal{R}_0\), generation time (T gen ) and surveillance p det . A higher \(\mathcal{R}_0\) and shorter T gen lead to shorter T fd , and vice versa; the lower the probability of detection, the longer is T fd , although with limited impact. This can be explained by the exponential growth of epidemics in their early stages. The WWSN will typically start detecting cases when there is a sufficient number of detectable individuals (D) traveling through it; this number is approximately \(D\propto {2}^{{T}_{{\rm{fd}}}/{T}_{2}}\), where T 2 is the doubling time of the epidemic (here measured in days). Adjusting either \(\mathcal{R}_0\) or T gen greatly affects T fd , due to the change in T 2 . Conversely, changes in p det do not similarly impact timing. Indeed, a twofold reduction in p det implies a twofold increase in D before detection. However, this increase in D happens within the span of a single T 2 . The exponential growth also implies that the ratio T fd /T 2 should be approximately constant as T 2 of the epidemic varies. More precisely, as shown in Fig. 4b, the complete invariant quantity reads as

$${T}_{{\rm{fd}}}/{T}_{2}+{\log }_{2}{T}_{2}={\rm{constant}}.$$ (1)

The correction term log 2 T 2 is necessary to account for the stochastic nature of the detection process30 (Supplementary Information 2). In Fig. 4c, we also show how the distributions of T fd collapse onto one another when considering the invariant quantity in equation (1). In practical terms, altering the disease characteristics effectively results in a linear transformation of T fd across all locations (Supplementary Fig. 10). Therefore, focusing on a specific parametrization does not result in any loss of generality of the results, allowing for consistent and generalizable analyses. Other aspects of disease transmission affecting T fd —overdispersion of the secondary infection distribution, length of the detectable period and seasonal change in the air travel network—have a more limited impact (Supplementary Table 4).

Fig. 4: Changing transmission dynamics predictably affects T fd . a–c, We use the same baseline WWSN and detectable period as in Fig. 1.

Scaling and optimization of WWSNs

Both the number and geographic placement of sentinel airports are critical for optimization of WWSN effectiveness, representing a classic resource-constrained optimization challenge. For systematic assessment of network efficiency, we define more precisely T fd (\(\mathcal{S}\), l) as the mean time to first detection for a WWSN configuration, where \(\mathcal{S}\) denotes the set of sentinel sites and l indicates the subpopulation at the epidemic’s origin. We can then average this metric over multiple origins by weighing each location according to a prior distribution, P(l), for the occurrence of an outbreak, resulting in

$${T}_{{\rm{fd}}}({\mathcal{S}})=\sum _{l}P(l)\,{T}_{{\rm{fd}}}({\mathcal{S}},l).$$ (2)

While T fd (\(\mathcal{S}\)) is a well-defined indicator of performance, its value is sensitive to variation in disease transmission characteristics (equation (1)). To provide a more informative measure of network efficiency, we compare T fd (\(\mathcal{S}\)) with T fd (\(\mathcal{C}\)), where the latter is for a hypothetical complete WWSN \(\mathcal{C}\) that includes all international airports globally. This comparison helps us quantify the relative performance of a specific sentinel configuration \(\mathcal{S}\). We define excess time for the sentinel system \(\mathcal{S}\) using the following formula:

$$E({\mathcal{S}})=100\times \frac{{T}_{{\rm{fd}}}({\mathcal{S}})-{T}_{{\rm{fd}}}({\mathcal{C}})}{{T}_{{\rm{fd}}}({\mathcal{C}})}.$$ (3)

This metric represents the additional percentage of time required for the system \(\mathcal{S}\) to achieve its first detection compared with the complete network.

We use three different strategies to define the geographic distribution of the sentinel network: (1) ranking of airports based on their international inbound passenger volume11; (2) ranking airports by their entropy in traffic flows—a measure of diversity that favors airports offering wide geographical connectivity; and (3) using a greedy optimization strategy that minimizes T fd (Methods). We acknowledge here that a wide range of approaches and alternative optimization strategies for network surveillance can be explored31,32,33. However, evaluation of these algorithms is beyond the scope of this manuscript and is left for future case-specific studies. In Fig. 5a we show excess time for the three different strategies considered, assuming a homogeneous prior for the source of an epidemic, irrespective of the area or population size (that is, P(l) = constant for all l). While the greedy approach systematically provides the lowest excess time, all three strategies show similar performance despite different network configurations (Supplementary Table 6). The radar chart also shows that the greedy strategy achieves relatively balanced geographical surveillance compared with the complete WWSN. Most notably, optimization analysis yields diminishing returns as the number of sentinels increases. A network of 20 sentinels detects outbreaks only ~20% more slowly than a system with thousands of airports, and doubling this number improves detection time by less than 10%. This result indicates a highly cost-effective trade-off between the efficiency of the WWSN and the resources allocated to it. A small number of sentinels provides near optimal efficiency.

Fig. 5: Scaling and optimization of a global surveillance network at airports. a–c, Using the same disease parameters as in Fig. 1, we evaluate T fd and compute excess time relative to the complete WWSN, varying the number of sentinel airports and selection strategies. a, Global optimization assumes that all subpopulations are equally probable epidemic origins, with the star indicating the baseline network’s excess time. b, Targeted optimization minimizes excess time for epidemics originating in Africa. a,b, Radar charts show excess time by continent for global and targeted greedy strategies. A balanced strategy minimizes excess time across all regions, while lower excess times for a specific region reflect targeted optimization. c, Spatial distribution of the first 20 sentinels under global and targeted optimization strategies.

Some diseases are endemic in only certain parts of the world, or have clear seasonal patterns; besides, we have shown that T fd is higher for some geographical areas than others (Fig. 2). For these reasons, the WWSN can be adapted by biasing the optimization procedure to improve detection capabilities for specific geographical areas. The greedy optimization approach allows for this by adjusting the prior function P(l). For instance, to minimize T fd for outbreaks originating in Africa, we can set P(l) = constant if l is in Africa and P(l) = 0 otherwise. Figure 5b compares excess time between conventional global greedy optimization and our targeted greedy optimization strategy. The radar chart highlights the bias introduced by targeted optimization, with coverage favoring Africa at the expense of other regions. Figure 5c shows how sentinel geographical placement shifts substantially when optimization focuses on a specific area. Targeting Africa leads to a higher concentration of sentinels in Africa and Europe, reflecting traffic flow patterns. European hubs are selected due to their high international travel volume, including traffic from many African countries. For example, Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport emerges as the second-top sentinel when optimization is targeting the African continent (Supplementary Table 6). Sentinel selection, however, depends on the specific disease considered and regional characteristics, requiring case-by-case optimization. These findings pave the way for dynamic adaptation of the WWSN to evolving epidemic knowledge and geographic spread.

Situational awareness with WWSNs

WWSNs can be used to provide evolving situational awareness on emerging infectious disease threats. To illustrate the potential use of WWSNs in gathering epidemiological information, we explore the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant (B.1.1.7) in Fall 2020 (Supplementary Information 4)34,35,36. More precisely, we consider a hypothetical scenario where the baseline WWSN illustrated in Fig. 1 is assumed to be operational. The study uses air travel data from September to November 2020, and in Fig. 6a we present probable distributions for the date of first detection of the Alpha variant. Our findings show that, even with 4% p det , the Alpha variant would probably have been detected by November, with a median detection date of 13 November and 90% PI from 15 October to 1 December. At 16% p det , the first detections are projected by late October, with a median date of 29 October and 90% PI from 2 October to 16 November. Because the Alpha variant was first reported by the UK government on 14 December 2020 (ref. 37), these results show the potential of a global WWSN as an effective early warning system.

Fig. 6: WWSN as an early warning system with inferential capabilities. a–c, We simulate a counterfactual scenario of the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant with a global WWSN in place, using the baseline surveillance system from Fig. 1. The wild strain (effective reproduction number \({{\mathcal{R}}}_{{\rm{eff}}}^{{\rm{ws}}}=1.1\)) and Alpha variant (\({{\mathcal{R}}}_{{\rm{eff}}}^{{\rm{alpha}}}=1.7\), 55% increase in transmissibility) are modeled with a T gen of 6.5 days and postinfectious period of 10 days.

What’s different now is that with global travel, outbreaks can move quickly among and between populations.

A familiar example would be the COVID-19 pandemic and how it disrupted the world as we know it today. During this period, a lot of technological advancements were achieved during a short time such as vaccine roll-out and also tracking of variants globally.

Since this pandemic, we have been constantly reminded of the threat that emerging infectious diseases pose, as well as new strains of existing microbes, and even infections that may eventually become untreatable. This should also serve as a constant reminder of the need to continue developing the tools and technology to fight them.

Infectious disease outbreaks since COVID-19

In 2022, shortly after the worst of the devastating COVID-19 pandemic had passed, the world was rocked by another infectious disease outbreak, which was soon classified as a public health emergency of international concern.

The culprit was mpox, then known as the monkeypox virus.

Unlike SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, this was not a novel virus but had been identified in laboratory monkeys in Denmark as far back as 1958. The first human cases were documented in 1970 among children in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

Since then, there have been multiple reported outbreaks of mpox, the majority of them limited to Africa. This includes a 2022 global outbreak that caused about 250 deaths, representing a fatality rate of 0.2 per cent.

An ongoing outbreak started in 2023 in Central Africa, claiming about 900 lives with a fatality rate of five per cent.

According to the World Health Organization, the two most recent mpox outbreaks were primarily driven by sexual transmission or body contact. There is currently no treatment approved by the FDA for mpox.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darryl Dyck

In early 2024, an avian influenza outbreak resurfaced in the United States when the viral infection that typically affects birds was detected in dairy cows for the first time. It has since spread to about 973 cattle in 17 states, and there have been about 70 human cases among people associated with farm animals.

Recently, a respiratory outbreak known as hMPV has been overwhelming hospitals in Northern China, with children, adolescents and senior citizens being at most risk. The origin of this outbreak is not yet known.

Untreatable sexually transmitted infection

Gonorrhoea is a widely known sexually transmitted infection (STI). Approximately 80 million people were infected by this bacterium in 2020. Though most cases remain treatable, an untreatable form of gonorrhoea is becoming more prevalent, threatening victims with infertility or even cancer.

Treatment failure can happen when a disease adapts to become resistant to antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance has significant implications for global health, including massive financial implications for health care.

An emerging STI threat

Other, uncommon but difficult to treat STIs are emerging. One is called Mycoplasma genitalium, the causative agent for non-gonococcal urethritis — a typically painful infection of the tube that carries urine from the bladder.

With symptoms similar to gonorrhoea, it can lead to infertility, increased susceptibility to HIV, failed pregnancy, cancer of the cervix and more. Yet, it is often misdiagnosed due to it being understudied and its complexity.

This understudied bacterium is naturally resistant to many antibiotics due to its unique structure, making it notoriously difficult to treat.

The WHO works to control the spread of gonorrhoea infections that are resistant to antibiotics through surveillance. My own research is adopting a similar strategy for M. genitalium, by using genomic surveillance to improve our knowledge of the infection and the improved ability to detect antibiotic resistance.

What is genomic surveillance?

Genomic surveillance uses next-generation sequencing technology to identify specific strains of pathogens circulating during an outbreak. This can also determine what genetic characteristics makes some strains more aggressive than others.

This technique was used effectively during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic and helped identify variants quickly.

Genomic surveillance can help us understand what we are facing, allowing us to tackle emerging threats more quickly and efficiently. It can help us develop sensitive, rapid diagnostic tools to detect drug resistance, especially for bacteria that are difficult to study in the lab, such as Mycoplasma genitalium, which is an extremely slow-growing and challenging bacteria.

With the continuing emergence of untreatable infections and new disease outbreaks, genomic sequencing can help meet emerging threats even in regions that lack adequate infrastructure where these tend to occur frequently.

This can be achieved through implementing affordable, user friendly diagnostic tools or developing effective vaccines for endemic regions. An example is the COVID-19 self-test kit that can be used at home. This is one of the key areas my research is also trying to accomplish: improving diagnostics in health care and making them accessible.

Pathogens are constantly evolving to become resistant to treatment in the perpetual battle between humans and infectious diseases.

To get the upper hand, we need to continue developing technology, including rapid and sensitive tools for identifying resistant bacteria and innovative methods for halting the spread of untreatable infections before they become serious pandemics."|"Throughout human history, disease outbreaks have emerged and re-emerged.

It is the first death in a measles outbreak that has infected more than 200 people since late January.

Lubbock health officials and the Department of State Health Services said the patient was an unvaccinated school-aged child.

Covenant Children's Hospital in Lubbock, Texas, has seen ""about 20 patients"" admitted with confirmed measles cases, and several have needed intensive care, Dr. Lara Johnson, the hospital's chief medical officer, said Wednesday at a news conference. None of the hospitalized patients had been vaccinated, Johnson said.

As of Tuesday, March 11, the Texas health department has confirmed 223 measles cases and 29 hospitalizations in the outbreak, which is primarily affecting children and teenagers. Johnson said there have been some confirmed cases in adults, but none requiring hospitalization as of Wednesday.

The North Texas area reported its first confirmed case of measles on Feb. 25. Nearly all of those who have been reported ill in Texas were unvaccinated. At least 30 cases have been reported in neighboring New Mexico.

As many as 1 in 20 children who get measles will develop pneumonia, CDC data shows. In some cases, measles can cause severe infections in the lungs and brain that can lead to cognitive issues, deafness or death.

While most people's symptoms improve, about 1 in 5 unvaccinated people will be hospitalized, 1 out of every 1,000 will develop brain swelling that can lead to brain damage, and up to 3 of every 1,000 will die.

""Measles is a deadly virus,"" Johnson said. ""...The predominant issues that we talk about and that have led patients to be admitted to the hospital are those respiratory issues, and so that is a frequent cause of death. There are also neurological issues that can happen acutely, encephalitis, swelling of the brain, blindness, other issues along that line that can also be a part of acute measles.""

There could also be a fatal neurological complication that occurs years after infection, Johnson said.

""There are lots of childhood rashes and fevers, and as parents, we all know that our kids get these here and there. This is not that. This is a much more serious illness that has much greater risk of serious complications,"" Johnson said.

Johnson also contradicted comments from newly sworn-in Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who claimed earlier Wednesday that the majority of the hospitalized cases were for quarantine purposes.

""We don't hospitalize patients for quarantine purposes,"" Johnson said. ""...That quarantine is not something that would happen in a health care facility. We admit patients who need acute, supportive treatment in our hospital.""

Measles is one of the most contagious infectious diseases, but doctors and health officials say the vaccine, which is normally given as part of the combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, is highly safe and effective.

""Measles is an incredibly contagious virus ... and spreads really easily among those who are susceptible or who aren't immune,"" Johnson said. ""So, we know, if you're in a room with someone with active contagious measles, you have about a 90% chance of contracting that illness if you are not immune.""

Johnson noted measles is an airborne virus.

""The best way to contain a measles outbreak is through vaccination,"" Johnson said. ""We're very lucky to have an extremely effective vaccine for measles. Having two doses of a measles vaccine confers 97% lifetime immunity.""

She said the risk to those who have been vaccinated is ""extremely, extremely low...The risk with measles is really for those who are not immune, who have not been vaccinated. And in that population, as I said, it spreads very quickly.""

For children too young to get the measles vaccine, Johnson said parents should continue taking the usual precautions — like avoiding interactions with large crowds — they would this time of year, as it still remains cold, RSV and flu season.

Johnson also said in some cases, infants who are typically considered too young for the vaccine could still receive it, especially if they had a known exposure to the virus, in which case even a 7- or 8-month-old would ideally be immunized within 72 hours of the exposure.

Dr. Céline Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, said recently on ""CBS Mornings"" that even a slight dip in vaccination coverage can lead to outbreaks.

""This is a measles outbreak that began in a very close-knit, rural, Mennonite community that has very low vaccination rates. And unfortunately, we have seen vaccination rates exemptions ... really soar in Texas in recent years,"" she said.

According to recent KFF polling, about 17% of parents say they have skipped or delayed a vaccine dose for their children.

""This is up from about 10% just two years ago. So we're really seeing a lot of exemptions [and] concerns about vaccination that are not warranted,"" Gounder said.

Before a vaccine became available in the 1960s, between 400 and 500 Americans — mostly children — died every year from measles.

""When I graduated from medical school [in 2002], I was confident I would never see a measles outbreak unless I chose to work internationally, because at that time, we were confident we'd eradicated measles from the United States and had really just gotten to a point where we wouldn't see these kinds of outbreaks happening,"" Johnson said. ""Obviously that has changed over the last 20-something years. And so we do see outbreaks pop up more frequently, but that is related to how much we are vaccinating our population. When we think about vaccine-preventable illnesses, they're only preventable if we have adequate vaccination rates."""|"It is the first death in a measles outbreak that has infected more than 200 people since late January.

""The best way to contain a measles outbreak is through vaccination,"" Johnson said.

Five years after COVID-19 was declared a global emergency, attempts by the EU to increase medical stockpiles to improve crisis response are stymied by lack of clarity over what individual countries have in reserve.

“Stockpiling of medicines is considered a national security issue in many member states so the information is classified because it can reveal some weaknesses,” Laurent Muschel, Director General at Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (DG HERA) told Euronews.

If a country lacks protection against a specific health threat - whether a pathogen or a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) risk - it could expose vulnerabilities that adversaries might exploit.

""The EU is building a stock of strategic countermeasures for which we need to consider both the European and national stock,” he added.

To be better prepared, the Commission will put forward a strategy on medical countermeasures against public health threats. This will include tools such as joint procurement and a broader EU stockpiling plan.

This strategy will complement the Critical Medicines Act, set to be presented later this month, which focuses on preventing medicine shortages and securing supply chains.

“One way to approach it for me is to look at the different threats and threat by threat look at what is necessary at European level and what is necessary at member state level,” Muschel said.

He said that DG HERA is currently working with each member state to assess threats and set targets, deciding how much should be covered at the EU level and how much should be the responsibility of individual countries.

Better prepared for future pandemics

Despite these challenges in preparedness, Muschel - whose own agency was created after the COVID-19 pandemic - is confident the EU is “much better prepared than five years ago” to confront a health crisis, and that regular testing of emergency protocols ensures that the lessons of COVID-19 are remembered.

According to Muschel, the greatest current risk to the EU is avian flu.

“With regular cases of human infections in the US and the risk of mutation leading to human-to-human transmission, we consider it the biggest threat,” he said, stressing the need for readily available vaccines.

""So far, the cases have been only from animals to humans, but the more people are getting infected, the more there is a risk of mutation,” he said.

As the majority of avian flu cases are in the US, another challenge emerges as the Trump administration’s decision to withdraw from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and limit international communication.

""That's the role of the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention to inform the rest of the world on how the epidemiological situation evolves,” Muschel said.

“I remember that President Trump was criticising China for not being transparent during COVID-19 so I do hope that the United States will not do a similar mistake and that the flow of information will continue”."|"If a country lacks protection against a specific health threat - whether a pathogen or a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) risk - it could expose vulnerabilities that adversaries might exploit.

Holy water from an Ethiopian well famed for its 'healing properties' almost started a cholera outbreak in Europe. At least seven people were struck down by the diarrhoea-inducing disease after religious tourists brought the water back to the UK and Germany.

The contaminated water was taken from the Bermel Giorgis well in Ethiopia's Quara district. The spring's website says the water offers ""profound spiritual revelations"", ""healing and peace for body and mind"" and a chance to ""witness the miraculous power of the holy water first hand"" – which the tourists surely did.

The US Defense Department’s intelligence agency believed the virus could have been engineered in a lab in Wuhan, China - and caused the pandemic that has killed seven million people so far.

Scientists at the Defense Intelligence Agency concluded the Wuhan Institute of Virology was highly skilled at genetic manipulation, according to analysis obtained by US Right to Know.

And they said the unique make-up of Covid was ""consistent with the hypothesis"" that it was ""a lab-engineered virus"" that ""escaped"".

The 46-page presentation - dated June 25, 2020 and marked ""secret"" - concluded that the virus could have come from ""a large bank"" of bat coronaviruses at the US-funded Wuhan lab.

For years, Shi Zhengli - the lead scientist at the Wuhan lab dubbed ""Batwoman"" - manipulated viruses to make them more infectious in humans, experts claim.

Her lab has been at the centre of the storm since Covid emerged just miles from the facility.

Just weeks before Covid emerged, their ""bank"" of more than 20,000 viruses was mysteriously taken offline.

Many believe it could hold key clues about the origins.

So far, the CIA, FBI and the US Department of Energy have all backed a lab leak as the most likely explanation - with many pointing the finger at the Wuhan lab.

The Sun also revealed how military chiefs were repeatedly told that Covid was a lab leak at the start of the pandemic.

But the new document from the Defense Intelligence Agency is the most detailed analysis released to the public so far that explains the evidence behind the theory.

James Phillips, former Special Adviser to the Prime Minister between April 2020 and September 2022, said: ""This is precisely the conclusion our team came to at the time, but in direct contradiction to the position the UK science establishment strongly took.""

Biosafety expert Dr Richard Ebright claimed: ""All informed parties and persons - without exception - have known for five years.

""This includes those who lied to the public for five years.""

Scientist Steve Massey told US Right to Know that the documents are ""highly significant"".

He said it shows that ""a strong scientific basis supporting a potential lab leak was identified early on"".

The analysis also pointed out that researchers at the Wuhan lab were carrying out experiments at biosafety levels ""which would make an accidental release"" of an infectious bat coronavirus ""more likely"".

They also noted ""Chinese labs have had a history of virus escapes"".

The docs were disclosed through a FOI request for assessments from scientists Robert Greg Cutlip, Jean-Paul Chretien, and John Hardham.

The trio had conducted work for the National Center for Medical Intelligence - which is part of the Defense Intelligence Agency.

The Great Covid Cover-up By Imogen Braddick, Assistant Foreign Editor FEW of us had heard of the Chinese city of Wuhan when the world was first paralysed by Covid-19 five years ago. Today, the sprawling metropolis is synonymous with the ­pandemic that claimed 227,000 lives in the UK — along with its sinister labs where top secret biological experiments are ­carried out. Within the first few days of Britain’s initial lockdown in March 2020, as millions were confined to their homes, questions were already being asked about whether Wuhan’s ­Institute of Virology could be behind the outbreak. Now, as the country marks the five-year anniversary of Covid-19, an exclusive documentary by The Sun reveals the experts, scientists and investigators who not only believe the virus was caused by a lab leak, but that American scientists helped to cover up the scandal. Our documentary took me to the heart of the origins of Covid and explores whether China was trying to cover up the creation of a ­biological weapon by blaming the pandemic on a wet food market 17 miles away. We also reveal that, while scientists publicly insisted the disease came from “natural” sources, behind the scenes they were exchanging messages about a laboratory leak. One expert told us: “Watergate was nothing compared to this. “This is the Chernobyl of biology.” Dr Robert Redfield, the former head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said that a few months before the pandemic, the Wuhan Institute was taken over by the Chinese military while officials deleted its databases and took on a contract for a new ventilation system. We now know that three lab researchers fell ill in November 2019 — a month before the first Covid cases were reported to the World Health Organisation. “I think that’s when the pandemic started,” said Dr Redfield, describing a “frenzied cover-up that was keeping Chinese President Xi Jinping up at night”. The US virologist says he was “aggressively silenced” when he voiced fears Covid had leaked from the lab, where “Batwoman” scientist Shi Zhengli was carrying out experiments on strains of coronavirus.

In August 2023, The Australian reported that scientists from four intel agencies agreed with Chretien and Cutlip’s views.

Yet government officials kept the findings out of the public eye.

It comes after The Sun's documentary The Covid Files: Inside the Wuhan lab-leak scandal lifted the lid on the early days of the pandemic in 2020 that killed millions.

We spoke the experts, scientists and investigators who not only believe the virus was caused by a lab leak - but that American scientists helped to cover up the scandal.

Scientists have repeatedly said that Covid was ""exquisitely matched"", ""completely pre-adapted"" and ""supercharged"" for humans.

And in January, we revealed that Dr Zhengli is still doing ""risky"" virus experiments.

Robert Redfield, the director of America's CDC during the pandemic, said the experiments have ""potentially catastrophic consequences"".

In a paper published in Nature, Shi and a team of scientists boasted they had built the first ""customised"" coronavirus ""receptors"".

In other words, Shi is creating the building blocks to change viruses so that they can infect different species - including humans, Mr Redfield said.

He said: ""Take bird flu - you can modify the receptor so that instead of chickens and turkeys, it can infect humans.

""It's potentially dangerous research. You are taking a non-pathogenic virus and changing it so that it could end up being dangerous to humans.

""You may have a pathogen that is restricted to pigs - but now you could totally change it so that it's highly infectious to other species too.

""She's playing around with bat viruses and modifying their receptor - so now they'll infect cows or chickens, for example. It's ill-advised.

""There's potential catastrophic consequences. It could cause a new pandemic in animals or humans.""

The research will make growing viruses in human cells easier as they have created ""customised"" receptors for viruses.

It means viruses can be more easily adapted to humans, experts said.

Dr Alina Chan, a genetic engineering expert, told The Sun: ""It looks like they have a new suite of engineered host cells to isolate more novel coronaviruses.

""There’s some potential here for risky work to happen downstream.""

Dr Chan, who co-authored Viral on the origins of the pandemic, added: ""In other words, once you have all these novel viruses growing in the lab, what do you do with them?""

Many pieces of the puzzle on the pandemic are yet to be found - and after five years of searching, no natural origin has been discovered.

In 1882, Robert Koch, the physician who discovered the microbe, told a room full of scientists that it caused one in seven of all deaths. In 2023, after a brief hiatus, tuberculosis regained from COVID its status as the world’s deadliest infectious disease—a title it has held for most of what we know of human history.

Some people die of TB when their lungs collapse or fill with fluid. For others, scarring leaves so little healthy lung tissue that breathing becomes impossible. Or the infection spreads to the brain or the spinal column, or they suffer a sudden, uncontrollable hemorrhage. Lack of appetite and extreme abdominal pain can fuel weight loss so severe that it whittles away muscle and bone. This is why TB was widely known as “consumption” until the 20th century—it seemed to be a disease that consumed the very body, shrinking and shriveling it. On a trip to Sierra Leone in 2019, I met a boy named Henry Reider, whose mix of shyness and enthusiasm for connection reminded me of my own son. I thought he was perhaps 9 years old. His doctors later told me that he was in fact 17, his body stunted by a combination of malnutrition and tuberculosis.

The cure for TB—roughly half a year on antibiotics—has existed since the 1950s, and works for most patients. Yet, in the decades since, more than 100 million people have died of tuberculosis because the drugs are not widely available in many parts of the world. The most proximate cause of contemporary tuberculosis deaths is not M. tuberculosis, but Homo sapiens. Now, as the Trump administration decimates foreign-aid programs, the U.S. is both making survival less likely for people with TB and risking the disease becoming far more treatment-resistant. After decades of improvement, we could return to something more like the world before the cure.

Read: The danger of ignoring tuberculosis

Anyone can get tuberculosis—in fact, a quarter of all humans living now, including an estimated 13 million Americans, have been infected with the bacterium, which spreads through coughs, sneezes, and breaths. Most will only ever have a latent form of the infection, in which infection-fighting white blood cells envelop the bacteria so it cannot wreak havoc on the body. But in 5 to 10 percent of infections, the immune system can’t produce enough white blood cells to surround the invader. M. tuberculosis explodes outward, and active disease begins.

Certain triggers make the disease more likely to go from latent to active, including air pollution and an immune system weakened by malnutrition, stress, or diabetes. The disease spreads especially well along the trails that poverty has blazed for it: in crowded living and working conditions such as slums and poorly ventilated factories. Left untreated, most people who develop active TB will die of the disease.

In the early 1980s, physicians and activists in Africa and Asia began sounding the alarm about an explosion of young patients dying within weeks of being infected instead of years. Hours after entering the hospital, they were choking to death on their own blood. In 1985, physicians in Zaire and Zambia noted high rates of active tuberculosis among patients who had the emerging disease now known as HIV/AIDS. TB surged globally, including in the U.S. Deaths skyrocketed. From 1985 to 2005, roughly as many people died of tuberculosis as in World War I, and many of them also had HIV. In 2000, nearly a third of the 2.3 million people who died of tuberculosis were co-infected with HIV.

Read: Tragedy would unfold if Trump cancels Bush’s AIDS program

By the mid-1990s, antiretroviral cocktails made HIV a treatable and survivable disease in rich communities. While a person is taking these medications, their viral levels generally become so low as to be undetectable and untransmittable; if a person with HIV becomes sick with tuberculosis, the drugs increase their odds of survival dramatically. But rich countries largely refused to spend money on HIV and TB meds in low- and middle-income countries. They cited many reasons, including that patients couldn’t be trusted to take their medication on time, and that resources would be better spent on prevention and control. In 2001, the head of the U.S. Agency for International Development had this to say when explaining to Congress why many Africans would not benefit from access to HIV medications: “People do not know what watches and clocks are. They do not use Western means for telling time. They use the sun. These drugs have to be administered during a certain sequence of time during the day and when you say take it at 10:00, people will say, ‘What do you mean by 10:00?’” A 2007 review of 58 studies on patient habits found that Africans were more likely to adhere to HIV treatment regimens than North Americans.

In the mid-2000s, programs such as PEPFAR and the Global Fund finally began distributing antiretroviral therapy to millions of people living with HIV in poor countries. PEPFAR, a U.S.-funded initiative, was especially successful, saving more than 25 million lives and preventing 7 million children from being born with HIV. These projects lowered deaths and infections while also strengthening health-care systems, allowing low-income countries to better respond to diseases as varied as malaria and diabetes. Millions of lives have been saved—and tuberculosis deaths among those living with HIV have declined dramatically in the decades since.

Still, tuberculosis is great at exploiting any advantage that humans hand it. During the coronavirus pandemic, disruptions to supply chains and TB-prevention programs led to an uptick in infections worldwide. Last year, the U.S. logged more cases of tuberculosis than it has in any year since the CDC began keeping count in the 1950s. Two people died. But in some ways, at the beginning of this year, the fight against tuberculosis had never looked more promising. High-quality vaccine candidates were in late-stage trials. In December, the World Health Organization made its first endorsement of a TB diagnostic test, and global health workers readied to deploy it.

Read: America can’t just unpause USAID

Now that progress is on the verge of being erased. Since Donald Trump has taken office, his administration has dismantled USAID, massively eliminating foreign-aid funding and programs. According to The New York Times, hundreds of thousands of sick patients have seen their access to medication and testing suddenly cut off. A memo released by a USAID official earlier this month estimated that cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis will rise by about 30 percent in the next few years, an unprecedented regression in the history of humankind’s fight against the disease. (The official was subsequently placed on administrative leave.) Research on tuberculosis tests and treatments has been terminated. Although the secretary of state and Elon Musk have assured the public that the new administration’s actions have not disrupted the distribution of life-saving medicine, that just isn’t true. A colleague in central Africa sent me a picture of TB drugs that the U.S. has already paid for sitting unused in a warehouse because of stop-work orders. (Neither the State Department nor DOGE employees responded to requests for comment.)

Last year, roughly half of all international donor funding for tuberculosis treatment came from the U.S. Now many programs are disappearing. In a recent survey on the impact of lost funding in 31 countries, one in four organizations providing TB care reported they have shut down entirely. About half have stopped screening for new cases of tuberculosis. The average untreated case of active tuberculosis will spread the infection to 10 to 15 people a year. Without treatment, or even a diagnosis, hundreds of thousands more people will die—and each of those deaths will be needless.

By revoking money from global-health efforts, the U.S. has created the conditions for the health of people around the world to deteriorate, which will give tuberculosis even more opportunities to kill. HIV clinics in many countries have started rationing pills as drug supplies run dangerously low, raising the specter of co-infection. Like HIV, insufficient nutrition weakens the immune system. It is the leading risk factor for tuberculosis. An estimated 1 million children with severe acute malnutrition will lose access to treatment because of the USAID cuts, and refugee camps across the world are slashing already meager food rations.

For billions of people, TB is already a nightmare disease, both because the bacterium is unusually powerful and because world leaders have done a poor job of distributing cures. And yet, to the extent that one hears about TB at all in the rich world, it’s usually in the context of a looming crisis: Given enough time, a strain of tuberculosis may evolve that is resistant to all available antibiotics, a superbug that is perhaps even more aggressive and deadly than previous iterations of the disease.

Read: Resistance to the antibiotic of last resort is silently spreading

The Trump administration’s current policies are making such a future more plausible. Even pausing TB treatment for a couple of weeks can give the bacterium a chance to evolve resistance. The world is ill-prepared to respond to drug-resistant TB, because we have shockingly few treatments for the world’s deadliest infectious disease. Between 1963 and 2012, scientists approved no new drugs to treat tuberculosis. Doing so stopped being profitable once the disease ceased to be a crisis in rich countries. Many strains of tuberculosis are already resistant to the 60-year-old drugs that are still the first line of treatment for nearly all TB patients. If a person is unlucky enough to have drug-resistant TB, the next step is costly testing to determine if their body can withstand harsh, alternative treatments. The United States helped pay for those tests in many countries, which means that now fewer people with drug-resistant TB are being diagnosed or treated. Instead, they are almost certainly getting sicker and spreading the infection.

Drug-resistant TB is harder to cure in individual patients, and so the aid freeze will directly lead to many deaths. But giving the bacteria so many new opportunities to develop drug resistance is also a threat to all of humanity. We now risk the emergence of TB strains that can’t be cured with our existing tools. The millennia-long history of humans’ fight against TB has seen many vicious cycles. I fear we are watching the dawn of another.

March 12 (UPI) -- Health experts say an Australian study linking sexual activity to an infection that 1 in 3 U.S. women contract has provided a new tool to prevent recurrences, as well as find a cure.

In the wake of what's being hailed as a landmark study, experts from around the world told UPI this week that they've gained a key new insight into the nature of bacterial vaginosis, although they also cautioned that finding a cure for all women will require more work.

BV is caused by a disruption in the bacteria present in the vagina. In BV, the ""good"" or ""healthy"" bacteria called lactobacilli are replaced with a group of ""bad"" or ""non-optimal' bacteria, causing symptoms such as discharge and odor.

While most women with BV do not experience complications, it can increase the risk of developing pelvic inflammatory disease, getting a sexually transmitted infection and experiencing pregnancy complications, such as preterm birth.

BV has been treated since the 1980s with oral or vaginal antibiotics. However, half of women experience recurrences within three to six months of completing antibiotics. Women in monogamous relationships with a regular sexual partner are even more likely to get BV again after antibiotics.

Until now, BV was not widely considered to be sexually transmitted, despite evidence that showed a possible connection. But the study published last week found a strong linkage that promises to ""forever change the way BV is treated,"" according to its authors, clinician scientist Catriona Bradshaw and senior research fellow Lenka Vodstrcil, of the Melbourne Sexual Health Center and Monash University.

The study was published Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine. In it, they determined that BV is indeed sexually transmitted and reported that when male partners took oral and topical antimicrobial therapies, those actions -- combined with the usual antibiotic treatment for women -- resulted in significantly lower recurrence rates.

They found a 35% rate of BV recurrence among couples in which both partners were treated, compared with a 63% rate of recurrence among those in a standard-care control group after 12 weeks.

They undertook the effort after earlier studies showed that men may carry bacteria associated with BV in their urethras, and that microbes found in the penis can predict a woman's risk of contracting the condition.

Past trials testing that connection didn't show an increased incidence of cure, which was interpreted as evidence against sexual transmission. However, most of those trials had ""substantive limitations,"" Bradshaw and Vodstrci argued, including limited statistical power among other drawbacks.

Their findings, based on 150 couples in monogamous relationships from April 2019 through November 2023, have been hailed as a breakthrough in efforts to find a cure for BV, which have been hampered by an incomplete understanding of its origins and development.

Bradshaw told UPI in emailed comments the study proved for the first time that ""sexual transmission [of BV] is occurring and that reinfection is the dominant driver of recurrence.""

""The fact that concurrent treatment of male partners -- using an oral antibiotic to target urethral BV bacteria and a topical antibiotic cream to target the penile skin BV bacteria -- very significantly reduces BV recurrence for women confirms reinfection of women is occurring.

""This is exactly what we see with STIs like chlamydia. If you don't treat the male partner, women get chlamydia back again,"" she said.

She noted that the women in the trial were ""highly motivated with highly recurrent BV."" Some had strong risk factors for recurrence, such as uncircumcised male partners and an IUD birth control device.

""Recurrence rates in these women are typically 60% to 80%, and this intervention more than halved recurrence rates,"" Bradshaw said.

She added: ""So, does this change the way BV is forever treated? Yes, it does. It is a simple strategy that is highly relevant to women with an ongoing male partner. Will it cure all women? No, but it offers a very significant proportion of these women the prospect of a cure, which they have never had before.""

The trial, Bradshaw added, also is ""a major paradigm shift in knowledge and clinical practice that very importantly helps us get far closer to curing all women, as it identifies a group of women who may be experiencing BV persistence due to female factors, such as an IUD.""

Reaction from women's health experts and researchers contacted by UPI was uniformly positive, although many cited the need for continuing study.

Rebecca Brotman, an epidemiology and public health professor and researcher at the University of Maryland's Center for Advanced Microbiome Research & Innovation, said the Australian trial showed that ""If you have BV and are in a heterosexual, monogamous relationship ... you are more likely to achieve a cure and prevent recurrence if both you and your partner receive simultaneous treatment.""

While it marks ""a significant advancement in BV treatment, further research is necessary to confirm the findings across diverse populations and for a longer duration of follow-up,"" Brotman added.

""The trial proved a significant reduction in BV recurrences with male partner treatment, but 35% still recurred in the partner-treatment group. I hope this trial paves the way for future studies to further explore the underlying causes, prevention strategies and improved treatment options for BV,"" she said.

Brotman also warned that classifying BV as a sexually transmitted infection needs to be approached carefully, ""as it could unintentionally reinforce stigma associated with sexual activity and BV. Further research is needed to clarify these relationships and their implications for prevention.""

Dr. Kameelah Phillips, an obstetrician-gynecologist and founder of Calla Women's Health in New York City, said the study ""reinforces what many of us -- both doctors and patients -- have long suspected: Sexual intercourse in heterosexual couples is a significant risk factor for recurrent BV, and treating both partners in monogamous relationships may be an important consideration.""

While it represents ""an exciting step forward in women's health,"" Phillips said it's important to acknowledge ""the study's limitations. With a sample size of only 150 couples, these findings will need validation in larger and more diverse populations before they can influence clinical guidelines.

""Still, for the millions of women who struggle with recurrent BV, this research highlights the need for fresh, innovative approaches to treatment,"" she said. ""They deserve more than temporary fixes -- they deserve solutions that truly address the root of the problem.""

Dr. Caroline Mitchell, director of the Vulvovaginal Disorders Program at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, told UPI the latest findings ""offer us another, important tool for helping prevent recurrence of BV in some patients. Since treatment options in the field haven't substantively changed since 1982, this is a huge win for women.""

In her practice, Mitchell said, she see patients for whom BV ""seems very sexually facilitated,"" but for others it is not the case at all, ""so I don't think this is universal. BV isn't like chlamydia. There isn't always that direct connection -- especially for recurrent BV.

""However, BV does seem to be sexually facilitated -- and the results of this study suggest that microbes on the penis likely play a role in at least some cases,"" she added.

""For people with highly recurrent BV, I do think that there may be some passing back and forth of BV-associated bacteria between sexual partners, and that treating both people ... will be necessary to clear those organisms."""|"Women in monogamous relationships with a regular sexual partner are even more likely to get BV again after antibiotics.

Hantavirus, found throughout the world, is spread by contact with rodents or their urine or feces. It does not spread between people. There is no specific treatment or cure, but early medical attention can increase the chance of survival.

An infection can rapidly progress and become life-threatening.

“It really starts like the flu: body aches, feeling poorly overall,” said Dr. Sonja Bartolome of UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. “Early in the illness, you really may not be able to tell the difference between hantavirus and having the flu.”

The virus can cause a severe and sometimes deadly lung infection called hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The agency began tracking the virus after a 1993 outbreak in the Four Corners region — the area where Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah meet.

It was an astute physician with the Indian Health Service who first noticed a pattern of deaths among young patients, said Dr. Michelle Harkins, a pulmonologist with the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center who for years has been studying the disease and helping patients.

“They were healthy, they had no medical problems and they were coming in with a cardiopulmonary arrest,” she said, prompting the CDC’s involvement as experts worked to determine what the patients had in common.

The majority of U.S. cases since then have been in western states, especially the southwest. Between 1993 and 2022, there were 864 reported U.S. cases. New Mexico had the highest number over that time, at 122, followed by Colorado at 119.

There were seven cases confirmed in 2023 and another seven in 2024, according to the New Mexico Department of Health. As for deaths, the state has reported 52 between 1975 and 2023.

The CDC has offered to test samples involved in Arakawa’s case to learn more about the strain of virus that infected her and to perform pathology testing.

Symptoms start one to eight weeks after exposure and initially can include fatigue, fever and muscle aches, according to the CDC. As the disease progresses, symptoms can include coughing, shortness of breath and tightness in the chest as the lungs fill with fluid. About a third of people who develop respiratory symptoms from the disease can die, the CDC says.

Despite years of research, Harkins said many questions have yet to be answered, including why it can be mild for some people and very severe for others and how antibodies are developed. She and other researchers have been following patients over long periods of time in hopes of finding a treatment.

“A lot of mysteries,” she said, noting that what researchers do know is that mouse exposure is a key.

The best way to avoid the germ is to minimize contact with rodents and their droppings. Use protective gloves and a bleach solution for cleaning up rodent droppings. Public health experts caution against sweeping or vacuuming which can cause virus to get into the air.

The hemorrhagic disease, known for its horrific symptoms like bleeding from the eyes, has already been flagged by health chiefs as a ""priority pathogen"" with pandemic potential.

The victim - a boy, according to The New York Times - had been taken to three different hospitals while unwell.

His three siblings were reportedly ill but have recovered, to child’s father said in documents seen by the paper.

The boy’s mother and her newborn infant died of unknown causes in January, it added.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) confirmed the death on Saturday and has since ramped up efforts in surveillance and contact tracing.

Uganda had hoped the outbreak was under control after eight Ebola patients were discharged in February, but this new death raises concerns.

In total, there are now 10 confirmed cases of the disease in the east African country, including two deaths.

The first known fatality, a 32-year-old nurse, was reported in late January.

He experienced fever-like symptoms, sought care at multiple facilities and consulted a traditional healer before dying.

The Ebola strain responsible for the nurse's death and the outbreak is the Sudan strain, while the strain affecting the child has not yet been confirmed.

It is the most contagious but least deadly variant – although it still kills around 50 per cent of those it infects.

With no approved vaccines for the Sudan strain of Ebola, contact tracing is crucial to prevent more infections.

However, since the most recent outbreak, experts have launched a trial of a jab against the variant.

In early February, the first participant received a dose of the vaccine developed by the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, a global non-profit. Since then, thousands more have been vaccinated.

Local health officials were hopeful after successfully treating contacts of the nurse, but the source of the outbreak is still under investigation.

WHO is helping by screening over 20,000 travellers daily at Uganda’s border points.

4 Ebola has already been flagged by health chiefs as a ""priority pathogen"" with pandemic potential.

Ebola spreads through contact with bodily fluids or contaminated materials.

It is a severe, often fatal illness that can cause symptoms like fever, vomiting blood and diarrhoea, and uncontrolled bleeding from various body parts in the later stages.

Uganda has faced multiple outbreaks of Ebola, including one in 2022 that killed 55 people and a previous one in 2000, that killed hundreds.

This latest outbreak is part of a broader trend of viral hemorrhagic fevers in East Africa, with Tanzania and Rwanda also reporting Marburg outbreaks recently.

What is Ebola? Ebola is a virus transmitted through direct contact with blood and body fluids and objects that have been contaminated by someone with Ebola. It also spreads through contact with sick or dead wild animals. It can take symptoms two to 21 days to appear following infection - this is known as an incubation period. Ebola first manifests as a high fever, intense muscle and joint pain, headaches and a sore throat. Initial symptoms are often followed by vomiting and diarrhoea, rashes on the skin, kidney and liver failure, and sometimes internal and external bleeding. People who survive the virus can suffer from arthritis as well as vision and hearing problems. Some types of Ebola can be prevented with vaccines and treated with medicines.

Ebola was discovered in 1976 in simultaneous outbreaks in South Sudan and Congo, where it occurred in a village near the Ebola River, after which the disease is named.

The disease is among several other on the WHO's watch list along with dengue and the bubonic plague of pathogens that could trigger the next pandemic.

The list was put together by 200 scientists from more than 50 countries after reviewing a shortlist of 1,600 bacterium and viruses.

Those marked as having 'pandemic potential' were easy to catch and potentially deadly in humans.

Scientists say urban sprawl and deforestation are driving up risky wildlife encounters, while global travel is giving diseases a free pass to spread across the globe.

There is also concern that climate change could be making parts of the world more suitable for disease-spreading critters to thrive."|"A FOUR-YEAR-OLD child has died of Ebola in Uganda, marking the second fatality in the ongoing outbreak declared on January 30.

Federal health officials notified members of the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee of the cancellation in an email Wednesday afternoon, said committee member Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.

The email, Offit said, offered no explanation for the scrapped meeting.

A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the FDA, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The cancellation comes as the United States is in the midst of a particularly severe flu season. So far, 86 children and 19,000 adults have died this season, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

“I’m quite shocked,” Norman Baylor, a former director of the FDA’s Office of Vaccine Research and Review, said in an email. “As you know, the VRBPAC is critical for making the decision on strain selection for the next influenza vaccine season.”

The FDA typically convenes the meeting every spring to get recommendations on which strains should be included in the upcoming flu vaccine.

The meetings are important because the flu virus changes year to year, and the vaccine must be updated to provide the best protection. Deciding on the strains in the spring gives vaccine manufacturers enough time to produce the shots to be ready for the fall.

For the 2024-25 flu season, drugmakers supplied the United States with an estimated 148 million doses of flu shots, according to the CDC. It’s unclear what the canceled meeting will mean for people in the United States who want to get a flu vaccine next season.

On Friday, a World Health Organization advisory committee is scheduled to meet on which strains should be included in the next flu vaccines in the Northern Hemisphere. That meeting typically influences the FDA’s strain selection.

In January, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to begin the process of withdrawing the United States from the WHO. Federal health officials were later ordered to stop communicating with the WHO.

Stat News reported Monday that officials from both the FDA and the CDC would participate virtually in the WHO meeting, however.

The canceled FDA advisory meeting comes just days after a CDC vaccine advisory committee meeting was abruptly postponed.

That meeting included a presentation and vote on a number of vaccines, including the use of the British drugmaker GSK’s meningococcal vaccine, as well as for a new chikungunya vaccine and the recently approved at-home nasal spray for influenza.

The canceled meeting in March is likely to add to concerns among scientists that HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr, an anti-vaccine activist, could undermine the vaccine regulatory process in the United States, possibly leading to a resurgence of preventable diseases.

Lawrence Gostin, director of the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University, said it is a “clearly emerging pattern to undermine, even eliminate, scientific advisory committees at HHS.”

“I fear that Secretary Kennedy is implementing his long-held skepticism of science and scientific evidence,” Gostin said.

Earlier Wednesday, Texas health officials reported that an unvaccinated child in the state died from the measles, the first death from the virus in a decade. An outbreak in the state has led to at least 124 cases, mostly in children.

“It’s a bad day for infectious diseases,” said Dr. Ofer Levy, director of the precision vaccines program at Boston Children’s Hospital, who has advised the FDA on vaccines."|"A Food and Drug Administration vaccine advisory committee meeting scheduled for March to select the strains to be included in next season’s flu shot has been canceled, a panel member said Wednesday.

Follow her on Mastodon and Bluesky . You can reach Helen on Signal at hbranswell.01.

A group of researchers last week released a small, preliminary paper theorizing that Covid-19 vaccines may be linked in rare cases to a constellation of lingering symptoms not dissimilar to those associated with long Covid.

They intended for their work to be the subject of academic discussion and to spur further study of what they dubbed “post-vaccination syndrome.” Instead, it has exploded online — and become a parable for the ways in which the internet is being used to weaponize basic vaccine research vital to advancing scientific knowledge about the safe use of these key products.

The study was released last Tuesday on medRxiv, a so-called preprint server where unpublished studies can be shared before they go through peer review, the process by which other scientists kick the tires, effectively, to help journals decide whether or not submitted research deserves to be published. The senior authors of the paper, immunologist Akiko Iwasaki and cardiologist Harlan Krumholz, both serious scientists, were clear in the press release they issued and interviews with STAT that these are preliminary findings that need much more study.

They both also insisted that they felt a responsibility to their patients to share what they are seeing, in the hopes it would prompt other researchers to investigate, figure out how to make safer Covid vaccines if there truly is a link, and, hopefully, find ways to help people affected by any such condition.

“I just saw people suffering and thought we should follow the science,” said Krumholz, founder of the Yale School of Medicine’s Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation. He stressed he continues to get Covid booster shots, and doesn’t think people should “overindex” what he, Iwasaki, and their co-authors are reporting.

“I don’t think it’s ready to be used in clinical decision-making. So, if anything, I’m just trying to tell people: This shouldn’t be factoring into your decision right now.”

That is not the message the internet is hearing — or at least the parts of it where people routinely challenge the safety of vaccines. There, news of this paper “is spreading like wildfire,” one critic of the work, Adam Gaffney, an assistant professor of pulmonary and critical care medicine at Harvard Medical School, noted in a critique on the social media platform X.

Elsewhere on X — and beyond — it was held up as proof that millions of people who believe they are suffering lingering illness from Covid infection were actually injured by the vaccine instead. (Many people with long Covid developed the condition before vaccines for the virus were developed.)

Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, and the owner of X, reposted one such claim to his 218.7 million followers. Right-wing influencer Benny Johnson seized on the study as well.

“We tried to warn you. This is completely horrifying,” Johnson said, also on X. “Studies are beginning to prove that the COVID Jab is far worse than COVID — and may in fact be a deadly poison for your immune system. Thousands of people need to go to jail.”

One researcher, whose university — like a number right now — has told its academics to stay out of media coverage of political events, expressed exasperation at the scientists behind the study, asking: “Why on earth would you do this now if this is preliminary?” Post-vaccination syndrome “is a term that RFK will love,” this individual said.

The fact that the broadness of the term could be read to encompass vaccines other than Covid shots, even though the paper only investigated the role Covid shots might be playing in the illness it describes, was also seen by some as a concern.

“The term is a problem, it’s a real problem, especially at this political moment,” said Gaffney, who believes the study has multiple shortcomings. “We’re at a moment right now where the U.S. government is undercutting people’s trust in science and vaccinations probably like never before in history. And to coin this novel syndrome without even proving that it’s caused by the vaccine is very worrisome to me.”

RFK Jr., obviously, is the new secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. The longtime critic of vaccines has earned substantial income for years speaking and publishing about perceived dangers of vaccines, and bringing vaccine injury lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies.

The paper was posted to medRxiv during Kennedy’s first week at the helm of HHS, when there were already signs that policies promoting vaccines would come under attack. A meeting of a key vaccine advisory group long scheduled for this week was postponed, with a new date TBD. There were reports Kennedy is about to fire some or all of the existing members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, giving him a chance to name new members to the committee. As it currently stands, Kennedy would not have openings to fill on ACIP before 2027.

Into the roiling cauldron of unease about the future of U.S. vaccination policy dropped the Yale paper, comparing a range of biomarkers from 42 previously healthy people who are believed to have developed symptoms after getting a Covid shot to 22 still healthy individuals. Though it’s not yet known whether all the people studied are suffering from the same condition, there seemed to be at least a temporal association between getting vaccinated and developing symptoms like exercise intolerance, excessive fatigue, tinnitus, and brain fog, among others.

Most of the people complaining of the symptoms developed them after their first or second Covid shot, though some experienced onset after a third, and in a few cases, a fourth dose of vaccine. There were cases among people who received most of the vaccines used in the U.S. — Pfizer’s, Moderna’s, and a Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which was briefly available but was withdrawn by the company in 2023.

“Oh, no! Really?” groaned an evidently dismayed Iwasaki, when told Musk had amplified a post on X alleging the study proved long Covid is caused by Covid vaccines. “I don’t want anyone to conflate the two different syndromes in one bucket. That is not the message we’re trying to convey.”

The incident is a textbook example of something that plagues vaccine safety researchers: a damned-if-they-do-and-damned-if-they-don’t phenomenon. If researchers see evidence that use of a vaccine might be causing harm, they are ethically required to report it and pursue study of it. But public discussion of so-called signals of possible vaccine side effects are quickly weaponized by anti-vaccine forces.

It is not uncommon for such signals to turn out to be false alarms, disproven by rigorous study. In the first couple of years after the H1N1 flu pandemic of 2009, there appeared to be higher-than-expected rates of miscarriage among pregnant people vaccinated against the new virus, though only among those who had received the shot in back-to-back years. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention funded a study to explore the issue over three flu seasons. The conclusion was that the earlier findings had been a statistical anomaly; there was no increased risk. The resulting study was published in the journal Vaccine.

Some safety signals, however, do prove to be true. The first rotavirus vaccine, to prevent a diarrheal and vomiting disease that afflicts young children, was withdrawn from the market when it was linked to an increased risk of developing intussusception, a serious bowel blockage. And the CDC and its vaccine advisory panel have taken a go-slow approach with RSV vaccines for older adults, because of an apparent increased risk of developing Guillain-Barré syndrome after vaccination. GBS is a neurological condition involving muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis. Most people fully recover, but some sustain permanent nerve damage.

To conceal possible side effects would be morally wrong and could endanger the health of people who take vaccines to prevent illness. Vaccine safety researchers do what Krumholz and Iwasaki did — they follow the science. But in doing so, and in talking about possible links between receipt of a vaccine and negative side effects before an association is found to be real could be perceived as casting aspersions on individual vaccines and vaccines in general.

Edward Belongia, who was the senior author on both the studies exploring whether vaccination with H1N1-containing shots was elevating the risk of miscarriage in pregnant people, said people who research vaccine safety are well aware of the possibility their work could be used to undermine people’s willingness to get vaccinated or to vaccinate their children.

“Absolutely. We know it gets weaponized and it’s very, very hard to fight that,” said Belongia, who is a senior research scientist doing vaccine research and infectious disease epidemiology at the Marshfield Clinic Research Institute in Wisconsin.

“Science is at a disadvantage against them because they can take little bits of information and distort it, twist it, oversimplify it, and for the general public that doesn’t really know much about science or how this works, it sounds concerning,” he said. “[But] there are all sorts of reasons why what we’re seeing … might not be real.”

Alison Buttenheim, a professor of nursing at the University of Pennsylvania who studies vaccine acceptance and hesitancy, said it’s critically important that vaccine researchers follow the leads that emerge, regardless of whether the outcome exonerates or implicates a vaccine.

She finds it reassuring to know this work is being done. But Buttenheim noted that science literacy among Americans is generally not high, and people don’t understand that science is an iterative process. “We live in a world where people are really uncomfortable with the idea that science evolves,” she said.

The increased tendency to release papers as preprints, before they’ve been vetted, is adding to the public relations challenges for vaccine safety research, said Belongia, though he noted that getting information out quickly, so that other researchers could build off new findings, was of critical importance during the Covid pandemic.

Iwasaki said the group grappled with the question of whether to post the paper to medRxiv, or to wait for it to go through peer review.

“I think about this every day,” she said. “But we opted to share this data in preprint because first, the publication process usually takes a while, and patients are suffering every day. And we didn’t want to wait until something is published to share this information with the patients … because most of them have been completely ignored.”

Krumholz concurred. “We did debate it a lot,” he said. “In the end, the information about it was getting out by the grapevine and we thought better to preprint it as it was going through peer review. And we have had experience with journals not wanting to publish information about vaccine adverse effects — and we do not know how long it might take to publish it.”

Belongia said there’s no easy answer to the question of what vaccine researchers who find themselves in such situations should do. The work must continue, and the public has a right to be kept abreast of signals and the ultimate findings — transparency is critical to maintaining the public’s faith in vaccines, he said.

Still, that transparency will be used against the field, Belongia admitted. “I don’t know the solution in terms of how to deal with this and maintain public trust in an environment where any sort of measured voice that reflects the uncertainty of what we’re looking at is drowned out by the chorus of misinformation and disinformation.”"|"Helen Branswell covers issues broadly related to infectious diseases, including outbreaks, preparedness, research, and vaccine development.

SALT LAKE CITY — As the popularity of keeping backyard and urban chicken flocks grows, health and agriculture experts warn that bird flu can pose a risk to your feathered friends — and by extension, a small risk to you, as well.

Estimates vary on how many people have backyard chickens. But the number, regardless of who does the count, is significant. In 2023, an American Pet Products Association's pet ownership survey suggested about 13% of households have backyard chickens. That's especially popular among millennials and Gen Z.

Baltimore Magazine put the number at close to 12 million people in the U.S. with backyard chickens.

Health and agriculture officials say there are steps you can take to improve the odds your flock stays healthy.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza has been confirmed throughout the U.S. in recent years, including in some backyard flocks. As the name suggests, the H5N1 bird flu circulating is very contagious.

How bird flu spreads

Many wild birds are infected with bird flu. And that's the most common way that other animals become infected. They encounter, play with or eat infected wild birds.

The Centers for Disease Control and Preventions reports that the incidence of backyard flocks infecting their human owners is pretty rare, but it does happen, usually through direct contact. People handle their birds, then touch their own eyes, nose or mouth, which are the entry points for infection. They can also inhale droplets without touching the birds. The health agency notes that infected birds that can be contagious may look healthy.

People can also become infected from touching contaminated surfaces. By flapping their wings, scratching or shaking their heads, the birds can send droplets that can be inhaled or land on something that can be touched.

The CDC emphasizes that ""no human bird infections have been reported from proper handling of poultry meat or from eating properly cooked poultry or poultry products.""

Flocks that are infected may die suddenly. Or the poultry can have low energy, lack of appetite, purple discoloration, less egg production, ill-formed eggs, nasal discharge or coughing, lack of coordination and diarrhea, per the American Veterinary Medical Association.

Protecting yourself if you have chickens

CDC's guide for backyard flock owners offers a number of suggestions to minimize risk:

Don't touch sick or dead birds, their droppings, litter or water sources that might be contaminated with their bodily fluids without donning personal protective equipment.

Always wear protective equipment around sick or dead birds, including safety goggles, an N95 mask, disposable gloves, disposable and fluid-resistant coveralls and rubber boots. It should be put on and taken off in different clear areas, where possible.

Don't touch your eyes, nose or mouth.

Don't touch your protective gear until you are removing it, then wash your hands in soap and water,

Never wear used personal protective equipment in your home.

When cleaning and disinfecting, don't stir up the bird waste, dust or feathers, which can disperse the virus into the air. When you're done, toss the protective equipment or clean it properly.

You should remove the personal protective equipment in this order: First, clean and disinfect the boots, then take them off. Take off and throw away the coveralls, then do the same with the gloves. Wash your hands with soap and water. Next, take off the goggles, head cover and mask. If the goggles are reusable, disinfect them. Dispose of the mask. Wash hands with soap and water again.

To disinfect the items that are reusable, use disinfectant approved by the Environmental Protection Agency that has label claims it is effective against influenza A viruses. Follow the label instructions.

Wash your clothing in hot water and detergent and dry on high heat. Immediately take a shower. And pay attention to your health for 10 days after you were exposed to potentially infected birds or contaminated materials.

Cats and dogs at risk?

Cats and dogs that are outdoors can also be at some risk if they encounter sick or dead birds. And that includes if they are near your backyard flock. The best prevention is to keep them away from wild birds, poultry and cattle.

According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, signs for them can include fever, lethargy, low appetite, red and inflamed eyes, nasal or eye discharge, difficulty breathing and neurologic signs like tremors or poor coordination.

The association also says not to feed pets raw meat or poultry or raw milk."|"As the name suggests, the H5N1 bird flu circulating is very contagious.

It's a scourge that has afflicted mankind for more than a thousand years. And it's what keeps Adam Ratner up at night: measles.

""It is the most infectious disease that we know by far — much more infectious than flu, much more infectious than COVID or polio or Ebola or anything else that I can think of,"" says Ratner, a pediatric infectious disease physician in New York City.

In his new book, Booster Shots, Ratner makes the case that the control of measles is a test of how good our public health institutions are. And the fact that it is making a comeback is a bad sign.

""When vaccination levels start to fall, we see measles outbreaks first,"" he says. ""And then those are often followed by outbreaks of other vaccine-preventable diseases, things that are a little less contagious than measles,"" he says, adding that ""it's only February and we have already had, you know, small clusters of measles in Texas and Rhode Island and Georgia and a couple of other states.""

Globally, it's estimated that measles killed more than 107,000 children in 2023, mostly unvaccinated or undervaccinated children under the age of 5. Last year, the U.S. had 284 measles cases — the highest number in five years. That comes as kindergarten vaccination rates against measles, mumps and rubella have dropped below the 95% threshold that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says is needed to prevent community outbreaks.

The U.S. hasn't reported a measles death since 2015. ""But I think that with more cases, with larger outbreaks, that may change,"" Ratner says.

Before the measles vaccine was developed in the early 1960s, the disease used to kill hundreds of children each year in the United States. Ratner sees the resurgence of measles as one of the ironic byproducts of the success of vaccination. With vaccine hesitancy on the rise, he says that remembering the lessons of our past with this disease is more urgent than ever.

""Measles thrives on being underestimated,"" he says. ""We tend to forget now, looking back, how bad measles was.""

Ratner says the development of the measles vaccine was just one step in controlling the disease in the U.S. The other was public policy that made vaccination affordable and mandatory. For example, he points to a large measles outbreak in Texarkana in 1970. The metropolitan area straddles Arkansas — which had a school vaccine mandate in place — and Texas, which didn't.

""About 95% of the cases were in the area where there wasn't a vaccine mandate, where kids weren't getting vaccinated in schools. So the political decision that was made about vaccine mandates affected the health of those children,"" he says.

Ratner says he's deeply concerned about the nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as health and human services secretary. Kennedy has campaigned against vaccines for decades and he's expected to be confirmed this week.

""I am very, very worried about the future of not only vaccines, but public health in general in this country and across the world,"" he says.

Ratner makes the case that public policy is critical to public health. He says the most important takeaway from his book is that our public health successes are fragile.

""We live in a society now where child mortality is rare, where diseases like measles are rare, and where when kids are born, you can expect that they will likely grow up happy and healthy,"" he says. ""That is not guaranteed.""

He says it takes political will as well as science to keep the country healthy.

The study published Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention echoes two smaller ones that detected evidence of infection in previously undiagnosed farmworkers. In those studies, several of the infected workers remembered having symptoms of H5N1 bird flu, while none of the veterinarians in the new paper recalled any such symptoms.

The new study is more evidence that the official U.S. tally of confirmed human bird flu infections — 68 in the last year — is likely a significant undercount, said Dr. Gregory Gray, an infectious disease researcher at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston.

“This means that people are being infected, likely due to their occupational exposures, and not developing signs of illness and therefore not seeking medical care,” Gray said. He said it shows that officials cannot fully understand bird flu transmission by only tracking people who go to medical clinics with symptoms.

Study suggests bird flu cases are undercounted

CDC researchers went to an American Association of Bovine Practitioners veterinary conference in September 2024 in Columbus, Ohio. They recruited 150 vets from 46 states to fill out a questionnaire and agree to have their blood drawn. None said they had suffered red eyes or other symptoms associated with bird flu.

Testing found three of the vets, or 2%, had evidence of antibodies to H5N1 infection. All three worked with dairy cattle, as well as other animals. None said they’d worked with a herd that was known to be infected, although one had worked with a flock of infected poultry.

Gray and some colleagues did a study last year of 14 dairy farmworkers and found two, or 14%, had evidence of past infections. Both had experienced symptoms but were never diagnosed.

Another study published last year by the CDC checked 115 dairy workers. The researchers found that eight of them, or 7%, had evidence in their blood of recent infection. Half recalled feeling ill.

The studies were far too small to use as a basis to provide a solid estimate of how many undiagnosed human infections are out there, Gray said. But even just a very small percentage could translate to hundreds or thousands of Americans who were infected while working with animals, he noted.

That’s not necessarily a reason to be alarmed, said Jacqueline Nolting, an Ohio State University researcher who helped CDC with the latest study.

Available studies suggest people who are infected mount antibody responses and may develop natural immunity, which is “good news,” she said.

However, if the virus changes or mutates to start making people very sick, or to start spreading easily from person to person, that would be “a completely different story,” Nolting said.

Experts urge caution around animals

The H5N1 bird flu has been spreading widely among wild birds, poultry, cows and other animals. Its escalating presence in the environment increases the chances people will be exposed, and potentially catch it, officials have said.

Right now the risk to the general public is low, the CDC says. But officials continue to urge people who have contact with sick or dead birds to take precautions, including wearing respiratory and eye protection and gloves when handling poultry.

“No one’s really questioning that the virus has been moving around the country more than has been reported,” said Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory.

He said he expected to see stepped-up information reminding veterinarians across the country to protect themselves with gloves, masks and other equipment to halt infection.

In a new statement reported on Tuesday by CBS, the FDA said it was “aware of reports of death or illness associated with uncooked food in 13 domestic cats in eight households, 1 exotic cat in one household, and an unknown number of animals at two sanctuaries for large felids”.

The FDA added that cases were found in California, Colorado, Oregon and Washington, CBS reports.

Last Friday the FDA told cat and dog food manufacturers who use uncooked or pasteurized materials from cattle or poultry to consider H5N1 bird flu in their food safety plans.

According to the FDA, the virus can be transmitted to cats and dogs when they eat products from infected poultry or cattle, such as unpasteurized milk, uncooked meat or unpasteurized eggs. In felines it can cause severe illness or death; dogs generally display milder clinical signs and lower mortality.

The outbreak of H5N1 in the US began last March when the virus was detected in dairy cattle in Texas and Kansas.

Twelve barn cats died after drinking infected raw milk at a Texas dairy last year, while in December, 20 exotic cats, including a Bengal tiger, four cougars, a lynx and four bobcats, died at an animal sanctuary in Washington.

According to a study published last year in the academic journal Emerging Microbes and infections, cat H5N1 genomes had unique mutations that could suggest “potential virus adaptation”. It found cats could “serve as mixing vessels for reassortment of avian and mammalian influenza viruses” as well as a “bridge” to infect other species.

Earlier this year, Chicago’s Lincoln Park zoo announced that H5N1 infections killed a Chilean flamingo and a harbor seal.

Since the outbreak more than 20 million hens have died, while 134 million birds across the poultry industry have been affected, according to the US Department of Agriculture.

Avian influenza has a grip on dairy herds in California, a few people have fallen seriously ill in North America and researchers have found that a single mutation could give the virus a better foothold in a person's upper airways.

At the same time, those who're tracking avian influenza's footsteps say most of us don't need to be preoccupied with the virus as we go about our day, at least for now.

""We're really on alert,"" says Benjamin Anderson, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Florida. ""It's a tricky thing to communicate.""

Fears that H5N1 bird flu could unleash a pandemic go back decades, and previous strains of the virus have proven quite deadly in humans. That has not been the case during this current outbreak. Most infections linked to the strain of bird flu circulating globally in wild birds and U.S. dairy herds — technically known as clade 2.3.4.4b — have been mild.

But two recent cases are a reminder this isn't a foregone conclusion.

First, a teenager in Canada was hospitalized, as was a Louisiana resident who was exposed to backyard flocks. In each, genetic analysis suggests mutations may have emerged as the virus replicated inside of them. However, there's no evidence any of this has led to human-to-human spread.

""The difficult thing is it's hard to know how much of a heads up we're going to get that things are changing,"" says Richard Webby, a virologist who studies avian influenza at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.

Here's what some experts are saying now.

Should I be worried about catching bird flu?

Despite its wide reach, the strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza — so named because of its lethality in poultry — driving the current outbreak has not adapted to easily infect humans, meaning it's still ""essentially a bird virus,"" says Webby.

Of the more than 65 human cases in the U.S., almost all of them can be traced back to some kind of close contact with infected poultry, wild birds, or dairy cattle. So, if you're not dealing directly with any of these animals, the chance of catching the virus in its current form remains quite low.

Unlike the seasonal influenza viruses, bird flu doesn't attack the cell receptors that predominate in a person's upper airways. Instead, it prefers ""avian-type receptors"" deep in the lungs and in the mucus membranes around the eyes, which seems to explain why many recent human cases have presented as conjunctivitis.

""It's not actually very good at infecting people,"" says Anderson. ""What we typically have seen is a lot of viral exposure in order to be infected.""

A few cases have popped up with unexplained origins in California, Missouri, and British Columbia. However, there's no indication any of the people contracted the virus from another human, or spread it to anyone else.

For now, the concern is more about what could transpire as more animals and humans get infected, says Kristen Coleman, who researches airborne infectious diseases at the University of Maryland. ""It's not an immediate risk, but that's not to say that it won't be a risk in the near future.""

That's because every spillover into mammals, including humans, puts added pressure on the virus to adapt to its new host, raising the prospect that certain mutations pop up, which could, under the right circumstance, let the virus more efficiently replicate and infect people.

Scientists already have an idea of what some of the most concerning changes would look like (at least to some extent), and it doesn't appear they've caught on yet, based on testing done in poultry and cattle.

But it's evident this particular strain of H5N1 is sickening a much broader range of mammals than previous ones, says Seema Lakdawala, an influenza researcher at Emory University.

""We don't know why yet, but it could be chance or a precise genetic feature,"" she says.



What does ""close contact"" with a bird look like exactly?

During the current outbreak, poultry workers have generally caught the virus while they're culling infected flocks.

Sponsor Message

This is considered a high risk activity because it can involve handling the animals and spending long stretches of time in facilities where viral particles in their saliva, mucus and poop can hang in the air and contaminate surfaces. For example, workers in Colorado were infected while depopulating birds in hot barns with industrial fans blowing. They struggled to wear personal protective equipment over their mouths, nose and eyes because of the heat.

Historically, human cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 have often been traced back to live bird markets. In this context, people tend to be handling, defeathering, butchering and preparing the animals for sale.

High concentrations of viral particles can spew into the air and be inhaled, or coat surfaces and hands, eventually ending up on your eyes and nose, perhaps after you rub your face, says Webby. ""If you're just walking past an infected bird, it's extremely unlikely that you're going to get it that way.""

Coleman agrees. In a study carried out before this latest outbreak, she sampled the air at a massive live market in Vietnam and discovered it was filled with aerosolized bird flu virus. They could even grow infectious viruses from their samples. Yet, none of the people they tested there had active infections.



Okay, I'm not butchering or touching any birds, but do I need to stop using my bird feeder? What about touching bird poop?

For the average person, it's unlikely you'd get infected from a stray piece of bird poop or from touching your bird feeder, although there isn't necessarily data on these specific scenarios, says Anderson.

How long H5N1 bird flu survives on objects depends on a variety of factors. For example, it can survive for days or even weeks under certain colder conditions and in water. Contracting the virus from a contaminated surface is a legitimate concern for people who are ""handling equipment associated with animal care on poultry or dairy farms,"" says Lakdawala, adding that people should be cautious at petting zoos and agricultural fairs, too.

Bird poop can harbor high loads of the virus, possibly for long stretches of time, but Webby doubts it would be a concern for more than a few days after being exposed to the elements on your porch or deck.

""If you had things that had bird poop on them, yes, you would want to avoid that or disinfect it,"" says Anderson.

You could do the same for your bird feeder. He says just use common sense hygiene principles like washing your hands and avoid touching your face before hand washing.

People who have backyard flocks should be particularly cognizant of the risk, especially if they live in the path of migratory birds. Do your best to keep your poultry from mixing with wild birds. If you're concerned, you can wear an N95 mask around them.



What's the deal with dairy cattle? Do I need to worry about milk?

Unless you're spending time with dairy cattle or raw milk, there's no reason to be concerned.

The spread of bird flu in dairy cattle took scientists by surprise. The best guess is a spillover from birds into dairy cattle in late 2023 was enough to set in motion the nationwide outbreak in dairy cattle today.

The U.S. Food & Drug Administration has found pasteurizing milk can effectively inactivate the virus. The same is true for pasteurized eggs products, and if eggs are cooked to 165 degrees

There's now ""strong"" evidence that contact with raw milk, laden with high concentrations of virus, is how roughly 40 dairy workers have become infected, says Anderson. Most likely this is happening in the milking parlor when people are sprayed in the face, or viral particles are aerosolized and inhaled.

Research has shown that raw milk can ""stabilize the virus on a variety of surfaces for long periods of time,"" says Lakdawala. Hence the warnings against drinking raw milk.

Sponsor Message

Even relatively small amounts can be deadly for mice, according to lab experiments done by Peter Halfmann and his colleagues at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. ""But we don't know how this exactly would work in humans,"" he says. ""It's still a big black box.""

While the exact risk is unknown, Lakdawala considers consuming raw milk a ""high risk activity,"" especially in states like California where bird flu has been found in some of these products.

Dr. Jürgen Richt, a veterinary microbiologist at Kansas State University, echoes that sentiment.

""Is the mouse a good model for humans? I don't know,"" says Richt. ""But don't become a guinea pig.""



What should I be doing to protect my pets?

The basic principles for keeping yourself safe from bird flu also apply to your pets.

Coleman's advice: Give your cats a little bit more supervision when they're outside. Keep them away from wild birds (dead or alive) and rodents, especially if you live on a farm or have backyard poultry.

Coleman recently reviewed the data, and found this current strain of bird flu looks to be more deadly in felines than it is for H5N1 overall, although it's hard to say because of limited data.

She says cats are largely infected with bird flu by consuming raw contaminated meat and by preying on wild birds, including during the current outbreak.

In Oregon, a house cat died after consuming raw pet food, riddled with the virus, which prompted a nationwide recall. It's possible that contaminated meat was behind an outbreak that wiped out 20 cats at a wildlife sanctuary in Washington state. In Los Angeles, raw milk is implicated in the death of several house cats.

Dogs are also susceptible. Last year, a dog in Canada died from the infection after it was found chewing on a dead goose.

Sponsor Message

While pets can develop respiratory symptoms, the infection can manifest as a neurological illness, seeming to mimic rabies, she says. ""If your cat or your dog starts acting funny, maybe circling or acting rabid, make sure to contact a veterinarian right away.""

There have only been a few documented cases of feline-to-human transmission of avian influenza, after people tending to the animals had direct contact, but not during this current outbreak.

Anderson says ""there's no need to panic"" that your pet is going to be getting H5N1 tomorrow, especially if you keep them from these known sources of infection.

""It's just about being aware,"" he says.
