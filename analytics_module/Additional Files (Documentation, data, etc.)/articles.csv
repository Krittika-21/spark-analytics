President Trump has been upending the global economy in the name of bringing manufacturing back. President Joe Biden signed into law massive investments aimed at doing something similar. The American manufacturing sector is reviving after decades of decay.

But there's something a bit weird undercutting this movement to reshore factory jobs: American manufacturers say they are struggling to fill the jobs they already have.

According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are nearly half a million open manufacturing jobs right now.

Last year, the Manufacturing Institute, a nonprofit aimed at developing America's manufacturing workforce, and Deloitte, a consultancy firm, surveyed more than 200 manufacturing companies. More than 65% of the firms said recruiting and retaining workers was their No. 1 business challenge.

Part of the story has been a tight labor market. There have been similar worker recruitment and retention issues in other sectors, like construction and transportation. But the shortfall of manufacturing workers is about more than just that — and with both major political parties pushing to reshore manufacturing, analysts expect the industry's workforce issues to get even more challenging.

The Biden administration invested over $2 trillion on initiatives aimed at reinvigorating American industry, in legislation like the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the CHIPS and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act. There's now an explosion of spending to construct new factories in America, and analysts expect the demand for manufacturing workers to pop.

The average manufacturing worker is also relatively old, and the industry expects a tidal wave of retirements in the coming decade.

The Manufacturing Institute and Deloitte projected that the industry will need 3.8 million additional workers by 2033 and that as many as ""1.9 million of these jobs could go unfilled if workforce challenges are not addressed.""

These estimates, mind you, were calculated before Trump's recent tariffs, which, at least theoretically, are supposed to compel even more manufacturers to build factories in America. If things go to plan, we may need even more Americans to start working in manufacturing in the coming years.

Today in the Planet Money newsletter: If manufacturing jobs are so great, why aren't more Americans doing the ones we already have? And what can the industry and the government potentially do to address this issue? (If you have been forwarded this or are reading it online, you can subscribe to our weekly newsletter here.)

Industry whiplash

Gordon Hanson is an economist at Harvard Kennedy School who has published influential research on American manufacturing, including on what happened to it in the face of competition with China. (We interviewed Hanson about his ""China Shock"" research in a past newsletter.)

Hanson sees what you might call whiplash in an industry seeing a reversal of fortune. ""A period in which there's been a substantial increase in manufacturing — it's a very recent phenomenon,"" Hanson says. "" I think we can fill those jobs, but we're just not gonna fill 'em overnight.""

One big reason manufacturers can't fill these jobs overnight is because they require workers to have particular skills. And it's not just skills needed to work on assembly lines. Only around 2 in 5 manufacturing jobs are directly involved in making stuff. Manufacturers also employ people to do research and development, engineering, design, finance, sales, marketing and so on.

Part of the political appeal of bringing manufacturing back is that, historically, they've provided good jobs and career ladders for people without a college education. However, many manufacturing jobs these days actually require college degrees.

Carolyn Lee, the president and executive director of the Manufacturing Institute, says that roughly half of the open positions in manufacturing require at least a bachelor's degree.

That said, the other half of open manufacturing jobs don't require a bachelor's degree. And manufacturers say they are also struggling to fill those.

Lee says some of the most in-demand positions in manufacturing right now are maintenance technicians, machine operators, material handlers and forklift operators.

Is manufacturing paying high enough?

A classic solution to apparent worker shortages: offer higher pay. That would probably convince workers to invest in acquiring coveted skills and enter the manufacturing workforce.

This is one reason Oren Cass, the chief economist and founder of American Compass, a conservative think tank, says he's skeptical whenever employers complain about worker shortages.

"" I have less than zero sympathy for employers who go around complaining about labor shortages and skills gaps,"" Cass says. He jokes that he has a side hustle running an ""incredibly innovative"" biotech firm. ""It employs leading scientists at $10 an hour to develop extraordinary cures. I have 500,000 job openings as well, and I have not been able to fill one of them.""

Sponsor Message

Cass has a point. We've covered a similar phenomenon in trucking: Trucking companies have complained of a ""worker shortage"" for decades, yet relatively low wages and challenging work conditions are clearly a huge factor behind that industry's workforce woes. Addressing those issues would probably go a long way to dealing with their ""shortage.""

Manufacturers have, however, hiked their pay in recent years. That has helped slash the number of open manufacturing positions from their peak of over 1 million open positions in April 2022. (Like many other industries during the COVID-19 pandemic, manufacturers saw a wave of retirements, deaths and quits).

Loading...

Offering higher paychecks would likely compel more Americans to flock to the remaining open positions.

But the higher pay that Americans demand to work in manufacturing is one of the big reasons that many manufacturers left America in the first place. And so this wage issue raises the question of whether many manufacturers, particularly labor-intensive ones, can be profitable and globally competitive in the United States.

Cass believes that tariffs can help even the playing field with foreign competitors. And he stresses that one of the keys to reshoring manufacturing — while maintaining well-paying manufacturing jobs — is higher productivity.

"" If somebody in the United States is 20 times as productive as somebody in China and you have to pay them 20 times as much, you are equally competitive,"" Cass says.

So if American manufacturers can prove to be much more productive than foreign competitors — meaning American workers can make more in less time — they can pay the higher wages needed to attract and retain American workers while still remaining globally competitive.

That, however, is a big if. American manufacturing has been seeing an alarming slowdown in productivity growth in recent years.

The manufacturing PR and skills problems

Lee agrees that manufacturers will be able to entice more people into the industry by offering higher pay. However, she says, the industry's issues with recruitment and retention go beyond dollars and cents.

Sponsor Message

For one, she suggests, manufacturing has a PR problem. Many Americans have outdated notions of what manufacturing jobs actually entail. She suggests that many imagine they're the dirty, monotonous and dangerous factory jobs depicted in Charles Dickens novels. But, Lee says, they're actually ""clean and bright and full of technology."" She sees changing American perceptions about manufacturing as one crucial part of convincing more young people to work in the sector. More generally, if the industry is seen as vibrant and growing, as opposed to dying, that will probably help with recruitment.

But even if the word gets out and more young Americans want to do these jobs, they'll still need the skills to be able to do them.

""These jobs are in factories that are completely different from the factories of 25 years ago,"" Hanson says. ""They require people to know how to use pretty sophisticated machinery.""

""The hardest skills to find are the ones that maintain and fix equipment,"" Lee says. ""Every company we speak with is trying to hire technicians. Every single one. The challenge is that there is no one walking around on the street with these skills, and it takes one to two years to teach those skills and another one to two years to contextualize those skills to the specific plant environment.""

Harry Moser, the founder and president of the Reshoring Initiative, argues that America should invest much more heavily in apprenticeships to build the manufacturing workforce of the future. Apprenticeships provide young people with pathways to learn vocational skills without having to obtain an expensive, four-year college degree. Moser says that American leaders have overemphasized college to the detriment of vocational training and that the U.S. system of apprenticeships pales in comparison with the ones in countries like Germany and Switzerland.

According to Third Way, a centrist think tank, in 2022 only 0.3% of the American working-age population was in apprenticeship programs. For comparison, in Switzerland, that figure was 3.6%, or 12 times higher.

Sponsor Message

Apprenticeships and other means to help Americans obtain vocational skills may be especially important for the high-tech manufacturing jobs we have today. Lee says today's manufacturing jobs often require some combination of ""knowledge of electrical systems, mechanical systems, logic controllers, hydraulic power and robotics.""

The Manufacturing Institute has been working to develop better apprenticeship programs to help Americans build the skills the manufacturing sector needs. "" The very best models of workforce development that we see and that we engage in at the Manufacturing Institute are locally and regionally led public-private partnerships, where manufacturers come to the table and — with the support of the community college system and the local business community — they build the talent pipelines that they need,"" Lee says.

Lee told us about one particular apprenticeship program that she's very excited about. It's called the Federation for Advanced Manufacturing Education (FAME).

FAME was founded by Toyota back in 2010. The car company had trouble finding machine technicians at their manufacturing plant in Georgetown, Kentucky. So it did something proactive: It partnered with other local companies and a community college and developed an apprenticeship program to create the workforce they needed.

Lee says FAME is a 21-month program in which students juggle work and school. Each week, they spend three days at the factory and two days at a community college, learning how to operate and repair high-tech equipment, as well as other crucial skills.

""And at the end of the 21 months, students come out with, in most cases, no college debt,"" Lee says. These students also see dramatically higher earning potential.

One study, by the Brookings Institution and Opportunity America, found much higher graduation rates for students who entered the FAME program. ""Earnings and employment gaps were if anything more pronounced,"" the authors wrote. ""Five years after completion, FAME graduates were earning nearly $98,000, compared to roughly $52,783 for non-FAME participants — a difference of more than $45,000 a year."" It pays to have scarce, in-demand skills.

Sponsor Message

Lee says that FAME has become a model of workforce development for other manufacturing companies. In 2019, she says, Toyota ""recognized 'we're a car company, not an apprenticeship-operating company,'"" so it handed the program over to the Manufacturing Institute to expand it around the country.

All the sources we spoke to agreed that the government and businesses need to do more to invest in programs like these to provide opportunities to Americans and develop the workforce that the manufacturing industry needs.

""As we go from this period of declining jobs to expanding jobs, we shouldn't expect that we're just gonna automatically reincorporate all that labor overnight,"" Hanson says. ""It takes a workforce system to make it happen.""

Late last month, Trump issued an executive order aimed at ""preparing Americans for high-paying skilled trade jobs of the future."" Trump ordered various administration officials to create ""a plan to reach and surpass 1 million new active apprentices.""

We'll be watching to see what the details of this plan are and whether that plan becomes action.

But what is clear is that bringing American manufacturing roaring back will likely require more than just slapping up tariffs or investing lots of money to build new factories. Leaders may need to regear our education system to help more Americans acquire the skills that manufacturers need for a productive and capable workforce.

This brings us to an even bigger question: What warrants all these interventions to boost one particular sector of the economy? Is manufacturing actually special? And, if so, what makes it so special? That's next week in the Planet Money newsletter."|"Why aren't Americans filling the manufacturing jobs we already have?

The apparel retailer said it expects revenue in the first quarter, which ended in early May, to be around $1.1 billion, a decline of about 5% compared to the prior-year period. American Eagle anticipates comparable sales will drop 3%, led by an expected 4% decline at intimates brand Aerie. American Eagle previously expected first-quarter sales to be down by a mid-single-digit percentage and anticipated full-year sales would drop by a low single-digit percentage.

Shares plunged more than 17% in extended trading.

When it reported fiscal fourth-quarter results in March, American Eagle warned that the first quarter was off to a ""slower than expected"" start, due to weak demand and cold weather. Conditions evidently worsened as the quarter progressed, and the retailer turned to steep discounts to move inventory.

As a result, American Eagle is expecting to see an operating loss of around $85 million and an adjusted operating loss, which cuts out one-time charges related to its restructuring, of about $68 million for the quarter. That loss reflects ""higher than planned"" discounting and a $75 million inventory charge related to a write-down of spring and summer merchandise, the company said.

""We are clearly disappointed with our execution in the first quarter. Merchandising strategies did not drive the results we anticipated, leading to higher promotions and excess inventory. As a result, we have taken an inventory write down on spring and summer goods,"" said CEO Jay Schottenstein.

""We have entered the second quarter in a better position, with inventory more aligned to sales trends,"" he said. ""Additionally, we are actively evaluating our forward plans. Our teams continue to work with urgency to strengthen product performance, while improving our buying principles.""

The company added it is withdrawing its fiscal 2025 guidance ""due to macro uncertainty and as management reviews forward plans in the context of first quarter results."" It is unclear if recent tariff policy changes had an effect on American Eagle.

Some companies bought inventory earlier than usual to plan for higher duties, but American Eagle repeatedly said in March that it was in a solid inventory position and was able to go after trends as customer preferences shifted.

At the start of the first quarter, the company said it had some inventory outages and needed to supplement stock in a few key categories, particularly at Aerie, one of its primary growth drivers."|"American Eagle anticipates comparable sales will drop 3%, led by an expected 4% decline at intimates brand Aerie.

UnitedHealth Group abruptly replaced CEO Andrew Witty on Tuesday, as the sweeping problems facing the company and industry deepened.

Witty resigned ""for personal reasons,"" UnitedHealth said. He was replaced, effective immediately, by the company's former CEO and current chairman, Stephen J. Hemsley. A UnitedHealth spokesperson declined to comment further.

Shares in UnitedHealth plunged more than 16% by late morning Tuesday.

The massive health care conglomerate is one of the largest companies in the world — and, recently, one of the most publicly troubled. It owns Change Healthcare, a payments processor used by hospitals, doctors and pharmacists. A massive cyberattack last year paralyzed swaths of the entire U.S. health care system, affecting an estimated 100 million people.

A killing that shocked the country

It also owns UnitedHealthcare, the largest U.S. health insurer, whose CEO, Brian Thompson, was shot and killed in Manhattan in December.

The killing sparked a widespread consumer backlash over the high costs and denied claims of U.S. health care. The alleged shooter, Luigi Mangione, is facing the death penalty and has pleaded not guilty to four federal charges.

The fury against health insurers is so pervasive that some people view Mangione as a vigilante folk hero. An online fundraiser for his legal costs has raised more than $1 million.

Since December, Witty has tried to address some of the anger against his company and his industry. ""We understand and share the desire to build a health care system that works better for everyone,"" he wrote in a New York Times op-ed in December.

Big Health Care's financial problems are mounting

But ultimately, it was UnitedHealth's worsening financial problems that appeared to end Witty's four-year tenure. The company and its competitors have been facing rising costs in the Medicare Advantage businesses that allow private insurers to collect government payments for managing the care of seniors. These programs were once widely seen as money-makers for big health insurers.

But now Medicare-related problems appear to have cost multiple big health care CEOs their jobs. CVS Health, the owner of Aetna and one of UnitedHealth's top competitors, in October abruptly replaced its CEO, Karen Lynch.

UnitedHealth on Tuesday also said it was suspending its 2025 outlook, ""as care activity continued to accelerate."" UnitedHealth also said it was facing ""higher than expected"" medical costs in its Medicare Advantage business.

In other words: The senior citizens that UnitedHealth insures through its large Medicare business are going to the doctor more than expected, increasing the company's costs of providing care."|"UnitedHealth Group abruptly replaces CEO Andrew Witty, deepening a terrible yeartoggle caption Kent Nishimura/Getty Images/Getty Images North AmericaUnitedHealth Group abruptly replaced CEO Andrew Witty on Tuesday, as the sweeping problems facing the company and industry deepened.

The new layoffs will bring Nissan’s total workforce reduction to around 20,000 jobs, after it previously announced plans to cut 9,000 positions.

Nissan saw its profit almost wiped out in the financial year just ended. Operating profit totaled 69.8 billion yen ($472 million) in the 12 months to March, a decline of 88% from the previous year.

Nissan has been badly damaged by weakening sales in the United States and China, then saw merger talks with Honda (HMC) collapse and was recently forced to replace its chief executive. Like rivals, it is also being squeezed by US tariffs and threatened by fast-rising Chinese electric vehicle makers in markets in Southeast Asia and elsewhere.

New CEO Ivan Espinosa now faces the difficult job of turning around an automaker that has seen its once-mighty brand value eroded.

The results were a “wake-up call,” he said at a press conference. Still, a sudden turnaround seems unlikely – the automaker expects a 200 billion yen operating loss in the first quarter, CFO Jeremie Papin said.

Analysts have said Nissan is now paying the price for years under former Chairman Carlos Ghosn when it focused too heavily on sales volume and used heavy discounts to keep cars moving off lots. That has left it with an aging line-up that it is now scrambling to update.

Espinosa said Nissan must prioritize self-improvement with greater urgency and speed, and aim for profitability by relying less on volume.

It is aiming for total cost savings of 500 billion yen versus the 2024 financial year. This will see it cut the number of its production plants to 10 from 17 and reduce the complexity of parts by 70%."|"The new layoffs will bring Nissan’s total workforce reduction to around 20,000 jobs, after it previously announced plans to cut 9,000 positions.

The latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that consumer prices increased 2.3% over the prior year in April, a slowdown from March's 2.4% and below economists' forecast for 2.4%. This marked the lowest annual increase since February 2021, before a large increase in inflation sparked a Federal Reserve interest rate hiking cycle.

On a month-over-month basis, prices increased 0.2%, lower than the 0.3% estimated by economists. Prices fell 0.1% on a monthly basis in March by comparison. A 0.3% rise in the index for shelter accounted for more than half of the all items increase, per the BLS.

""There isn't a lot of evidence of tariffs boosting the CPI in April, but this shouldn't be surprising as it takes time,"" Oxford Economics chief US economist Ryan Sweet wrote in a note to clients. ""The areas where tariffs likely boosted prices in April were in furniture/bedding, appliances, and to a lesser extent toys.""

Toy prices increased 0.3% after falling in three of the previous four months. Meanwhile, furniture and bedding prices rose 1.5%. Appliance costs popped 0.8%.

On a ""core"" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, prices in April climbed 0.2% over the prior month, ahead of March's 0.1% rise but below consensus projections for a 0.3% increase. Over the last year, core prices rose 2.8%, unchanged from the prior month and in line with Wall Street's expectations.

The CPI report greets investors less than 24 hours after markets soared on news that the US and China have placed a 90-day pause on a wide swath of tariffs between the two countries.

NBC is adding Michael Jordan to its National Basketball Association coverage.

The network announced on Monday at its Upfront presentation that Jordan will join the network as a special contributor to NBA broadcasts.

""I am so excited to see the NBA back on NBC,"" Jordan said in a video alongside the announcement. ""The NBA on NBC was a meaningful part of my career, and I'm excited about being a special contributor to the project.

It is unclear what Jordan's exact role will be. A person familiar with the matter told CNBC the basketball legend will not be a ""regular"" in the lineup but will appear throughout the season.

In July, NBC inked an 11-year deal with the NBA to broadcast games across NBC Sports and Peacock starting this fall.

Jordan's agreement with NBC marks his first partnership with a major broadcaster since his retirement from the court in 2003.

The 14-time NBA All-Star has since focused on his business career, first as owner of the Charlotte Hornets and later as a NASCAR owner of 23XI Racing.

NBC Sports President Rick Cordella told CNBC Sport last month that NBC was looking to bring back a blend of that '90s nostalgia to NBA viewers.

The network has also once again tapped into the music of John Tesh, composer of ""Roundball Rock,"" a popular anthem that gained notoriety with NBC basketball in the '90s.

Cordella also said NBC will bring back player introductions to the broadcast in an effort to show off the atmosphere.

Jamal Crawford, Reggie Miller, Carmelo Anthony, Mike Tirico and Noah Eagle will also be part of NBC's NBA broadcast this fall, as well as the use of an artificial intelligence-generated voice of the late Jim Fagan.

The deal offers hope for a permanent trade deal, but there is little clarity on what Americans will actually get out of it.

Under the deal, the U.S. will cut its 145% tariff on Chinese goods down to 30%, while China will lower its own tariff on U.S. imports to 10%, down from 125%. Both sides described the agreement as a pause to keep talks going — not a resolution.

Officials from both countries met over the weekend in Geneva to work out the details. At a press conference, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the message from both sides was clear: “Neither side wanted a decoupling.”

Trump also softened his tone on Monday, telling reporters, “We’re not looking to hurt China.”

That’s in stark contrast to his tough talk during the April 2 “Liberation Day” press conference, when he unveiled the 145% tariff.

Kelly Ann Shaw, a former White House economic adviser under Trump, told Reuters the move shows the president is simply following through.

“He is doing what he said he would,” she said. “This is absolutely about resolving disparities in the trading relationship.”

But many online — including economists, former officials, and political strategists — saw it differently.

“China has agreed to nothing,” said economist Peter Schiff on X. “If 145% tariffs were just a bargaining chip, China already called Trump’s bluff and won.”

Others pointed out that Trump gave up the threat of high tariffs without winning any clear concessions in return.

“I guess all those manufacturing jobs aren’t coming here now,” wrote former federal prosecutor Ron Filipkowski. “So much for Liberation Day.”

What did the tariffs actually accomplish?

Economist Justin Wolfers told MSNBC that the best outcome would be to roll back Trump’s trade policy altogether.

“The single best thing that could happen is if we went back to the trade policy we had on January 20,” referring to Trump’s first day in office.

Wolfers noted that most wealthy countries have spent decades reducing tariffs, with average rates now around 1–2%. From that perspective, Trump’s tariff policy was fighting a battle the rest of the world had already moved past.

Peter Berezin, chief strategist at BCA Research, added that China effectively got the same 10% tariff rate and 90-day extension as other countries that pushed back on Trump’s trade measures without giving anything up.

“I don’t see how that strengthens Trump’s hand in future negotiations,” he wrote.

Democratic strategist Matt McDermott said the White House still hasn’t delivered on its central promise: bringing factory jobs back to the U.S.

In the meantime, Americans are stuck with a 30% import tax, which eventually gets passed on to consumers. “Trump caved and got zero in return,” McDermott wrote.

Fox Business reporter Charles Gasparino said the Trump administration backed down because the markets — especially the bond market — started pushing back too much.

“What we have seen is a little lesson on how markets exert their power,” Gasparino wrote. “You can't go to trade war with the world without bad stuff happening.”"|"The deal offers hope for a permanent trade deal, but there is little clarity on what Americans will actually get out of it.
Under the deal, the U.S. will cut its 145% tariff on Chinese goods down to 30%, while China will lower its own tariff on U.S. imports to 10%, down from 125%.
Economist Justin Wolfers told MSNBC that the best outcome would be to roll back Trump’s trade policy altogether.
“The single best thing that could happen is if we went back to the trade policy we had on January 20,” referring to Trump’s first day in office.
From that perspective, Trump’s tariff policy was fighting a battle the rest of the world had already moved past."|['policy', 'tariff', 'trumps', 'deal', 'return', 'pundits', 'tariffs', 'trade', 'trump', 'slam', 'caved', 'china', '145', 'zero', 'economists', 'countries']|China|Geneva|Geneva

This amount fits inside the $4.5 trillion budget threshold previously agreed by Congress in its fiscal framework, allowing the House Ways and Means Committee to make amendments that will increase the national deficit.

According to the JCT’s detailed tables, maintaining Trump-era tax cuts, which were first offered in 2017, as well as various other fiscal ideas, will increase the national deficit by nearly $5 trillion.

However, these expenses would be substantially offset by around $2 trillion in savings resulting from reduced renewable energy incentives and more vigorous international tax enforcement. These values are compared to the Congressional Budget Office’s (CBO) January 2025 baseline predictions.

Republicans have had mixed reactions to the proposal, w hile some remain cautiously supportive, others, particularly fiscal conservatives, express concern about the growing deficit. Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX) highlighted the need for additional improvements before expressing his full support.

“I remain open-minded because progress has been made based on our forceful efforts to force change,” Roy stated. “But we cannot continue down the path we’ve been going down.”

At the heart of the GOP proposal is the extension of individual income tax rate reductions from the 2017 Trump tax cuts. These reduced marginal tax rates, set at 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, and 37%, are projected to slash federal revenues by $2.2 trillion over the next 10 years.

Maintaining the increased standard deduction $29,200 for married couples and $14,600 for individuals in 2024, will cost another $1.3 trillion. However, JCT notes that the elimination of personal exemptions helped offset those costs, adding $1.8 trillion in revenue through 2034.

Another expensive element is the extension of the alternative minimum tax (AMT) exemption, which alone could reduce federal revenues by $1.4 trillion.

The package also includes an expansion of the child tax credit (CTC), expected to cost $800 billion, and enhanced deductions for pass-through businesses, priced at $700 billion.

Other proposed tax reliefs include:

$40 billion for eliminating taxes on tips,

$124 billion for removing taxes on overtime,

$71 billion for a new senior deduction, and

$57 billion for excluding car loan interest from taxable income.

Meanwhile, modest revenue increases are expected from modifications to the Earned Income Tax Credit, projected to bring in $15 billion, and stepped-up international tax enforcement, expected to yield $116 billion.

Significant federal savings will also come from reversing clean energy initiatives under the Inflation Reduction Act. Key cuts include:

$78 billion by terminating the clean vehicle credit,

$104 billion by removing the commercial clean vehicle credit, and

$154 billion by canceling the clean electricity investment credit.

Although the bill offers a range of tax breaks and seeks to solidify Trump’s 2017 tax vision, the JCT report highlights the substantial fiscal implications that could reignite deficit concerns among both parties."|"According to the JCT’s detailed tables, maintaining Trump-era tax cuts, which were first offered in 2017, as well as various other fiscal ideas, will increase the national deficit by nearly $5 trillion.

Inflation was slightly lower than expected in April as President Donald Trump's tariffs just began hitting the slowing U.S. economy, according to a Labor Department report Tuesday.

TORONTO--Honda Canada will postpone a $15-billion Canadian (US$10.7 billion) electric vehicle investment project in Canada's most populous province, including a proposed EV battery plant and retooled vehicle assembly facility.

Honda Canada spokesman Ken Chiu said Tuesday due to the recent slowdown in the EV market, Honda has announced an approximate two-year postponement of the comprehensive value chain investment project in Ontario.

“The company will continue to evaluate the timing and project progression as market conditions change,” Chiu said in a statement.

The decision has no impact on current employment at the Honda manufacturing plant in Alliston, Ontario, he added.

Honda’s EV project in Canada includes a retooled assembly plant, an electric vehicle battery plant in close proximity, as well as two key battery parts facilities located elsewhere in Ontario.

The project was expected to see the two main plants create 1,000 jobs on top of retaining the existing 4,200 jobs at the assembly plant.

Under the original plan, the plant was set to produce up to 240,000 vehicles per year when fully operational in 2028.

Ottawa was set to give the Japanese automaker around $2.5 billion Canadian (US$1.8 billion) through tax credits, while Ontario committed to providing up to $2.5 billion Canadian (US$1.8 billion) in support directly and indirectly.

“The market cooling consequences of US tariff actions continue to be felt by everyone, Honda included,” Flavio Volpe, president of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers’ Association, posted on social media."|"(AP Photo/ File)TORONTO--Honda Canada will postpone a $15-billion Canadian (US$10.7 billion) electric vehicle investment project in Canada's most populous province, including a proposed EV battery plant and retooled vehicle assembly facility.

Before 1995, workers in China only had one day off per week. Weekends, as they are understood today, simply didn't exist for the 1.2 billion Chinese population.

That changed when then-premier Li Peng issued a directive to align China's labour standards with international norms, facilitating its bid to join the World Trade Organization (WTO).

The policy shift marked a significant change in everyday life — an early and powerful example of how the Chinese government can reshape the rhythm of society overnight to serve strategic goals.

It symbolised Beijing's willingness to use its power to change the lifestyle of everyone in the country, as one of the outcomes of its 15-year negotiation with the United States.

The breakthrough of the working-hour system in China not just enhanced Beijing's will to open its door to the global market.

It was a symbol of adaptation — a gesture to a rules-based global economy.

But it also laid the foundations for today's differences with the US — tensions rooted in structural mismatches over trade, regulation and state power.

While the 90-day tariff truce between China and the US is seen as a relief and an optimistic message for the world, at the heart of the stand-off is a clash between fundamentally different systems.

The US increasingly views trade policy through a national security lens, aiming to reduce dependency on foreign supply chains, particularly those involving China.

Conversely, China remains committed to a model of state-led capitalism that prioritises global manufacturing dominance.

What's unfolding now is not a negotiation between equals, but a contest over who sets the rules — and whose system can withstand the pressure.

It's a clash of Xi Jinping's Chinese Dream and Donald Trump's America First.

Strategic goods and strategic thinking

Trade is no longer just about economics for the US — it has become a central part of its national security strategy.

The supply chain crisis during the COVID-19 pandemic exposed the fragility of relying on a single country — particularly China — for critical goods like pharmaceuticals and medical equipment.

In response, Washington has moved aggressively to ""de-risk"" and re-shore industries deemed strategic, including semiconductors, rare earths, and clean energy components.

The Biden administration's CHIPS and Science Act and Inflation Reduction Act are designed with this in mind: to reduce reliance on Chinese supply chains and invest in domestic capacity.

The logic is straightforward — if a geopolitical rival controls your access to essential goods, your security is compromised.

That logic now underpins bipartisan consensus in Washington. The Pentagon, the Commerce Department, and even Treasury are aligned in this approach.

Meanwhile, China continues to rely on the US to maintain its global trade dominance. The US remains one of China's largest export markets.

Access to the US not only brings revenue but also legitimises China's role in global commerce.

Since joining the WTO in 2001, China has used its manufacturing strength to climb the value chain, becoming the world's factory. But with that rise has come growing scrutiny.

At the core of the issue is how China uses its state apparatus to direct entire industries.

The Party can create a sector seemingly overnight — from solar panels to electric vehicles — through massive subsidies, cheap land, tax incentives, and government procurement.

The solar industry is one of the starkest examples.

In the early 2000s, Beijing picked it as a strategic priority. Within years, Chinese firms, backed by billions in subsidies, flooded the global market with low-cost panels, undercutting foreign competitors and forcing several Western manufacturers into bankruptcy.

The same playbook is now being applied to electric vehicles and battery technology.

But the Chinese system doesn't just build industries — it can also destroy them. Once state subsidies are withdrawn or redirected, whole sectors can collapse.

For domestic and international players alike, the uncertainty generated by this top-down industrial policy is a risk.

This dynamic — of building with the state and eroding competition through state support — has angered not only the US, but also the EU, Canada, and others.

State subsidies have enabled Chinese solar panel manufacturers to dominate the global market. ( Reuters: China Daily )

WTO promises and political realities

The US has long accused China of failing to fulfil its WTO commitments.

These include promises to reduce subsidies, increase market access, and protect intellectual property.

However, over the years, Beijing has doubled down on support for state-owned and strategically chosen enterprises.

Despite entering the WTO as a developing country, China now dominates sectors it once pledged to liberalise.

In areas like digital trade and cloud services, the barriers to foreign firms remain high, while Chinese companies enjoy global access and home-market protection.

For Washington, this is no longer just about economics — it's about rules, reciprocity, and the contract of trust.

Trade deficits can be tolerated; systemic manipulation cannot.

That's why, even with a temporary tariff easing, the tone in Washington remains sceptical.

The current round of tariffs is broader than the last.

America's global tariff hikes are supposed to stop Chinese firms rerouting goods through other countries. ( Reuters: Florence Lo )

""This time, unlike the first round, is not purely targeting China, but imposes tariffs on nearly all countries around the world,"" Australian economist Shi Heling said.

""Firstly, to prevent China from rerouting exports through third countries into the US.

""Secondly, this is no longer just economic competition — it's a mix of economic and national security concerns. Ultimately, it's about who controls the supply chains.""

On the Chinese side, there is deep resistance to changing course.

Under Xi Jinping, the role of the Party in economic life has only strengthened.

Private firms are now expected to align with state goals. National champions like Huawei and BYD are not just businesses — they are arms of Beijing's broader global ambition.

The Belt and Road Initiative, too, is part of this strategy: to shape global economic flows in ways that favour Beijing's economic influence and geopolitical leadership.

So while China wants access to the US market to maintain growth, legitimacy, and influence, it's unwilling to concede control.

The ideological difference is stark.

In the West, competition is seen as a process governed by rules and independent oversight.

In China, the outcome — national strength — justifies the means.

""Both countries need reform,"" Shi said.

""China should stop giving companies excessive subsidies. Its economic policy is not built on a fair system — but on doing whatever it takes to crush competitors.

""The US should focus on the fiscal deficit and public debt. Even after the 90-day truce ends, major structural issues will remain.""

Australia and the regional balancing act

Even within the Asia-Pacific, this tension is playing out.

Countries like Japan, Indonesia and Malaysia, which once emulated aspects of China's state-driven model, are increasingly distancing themselves.

As their economies mature, they recognise the need to reduce market distortions and avoid over-reliance on a single dominant player.

This growing scepticism toward China's approach reflects a broader unease in the region.

In this context, the 90-day pause looks less like a breakthrough and more like a holding pattern.

It buys time — politically useful for both Trump and Xi, given the domestic pressures. But it postpones rather than resolves the conflict.

For Australia, this presents both risks and opportunities.

The trade relationship with China is strong, largely due to complementary rather than competitive industries.

But Canberra faces a strategic dilemma.

Economically, it can benefit from global supply chain shifts and Chinese demand.

Politically and militarily, it is tied closely to the US and must respond to the changing security environment.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese will ultimately have to choose a side between national security and economic gains.

Australia stands to benefit economically from the rising geopolitical rivalry between China and the US.

""China and Australia have strong industrial complementarity and relatively low direct competition,"" Shi said.

""Compared with other countries, trade difficulties between China and Australia will be less."""|"The US increasingly views trade policy through a national security lens, aiming to reduce dependency on foreign supply chains, particularly those involving China.

But economists don’t expect that to last|2025-05-13 04:01:36|"WASHINGTON (AP) — Inflation cooled for the third straight month in April even after some of President Donald Trump’s tariffs took effect, though economists and many business owners expect inflation will climb by this summer.

Consumer prices rose 2.3% in April from a year ago, the Labor Department said Tuesday, down from 2.4% in March and the smallest increase in more than four years. On a monthly basis, prices rose modestly, increasing 0.2% from March to April after falling 0.1% the previous month, the first drop in five years.

Grocery prices dipped 0.4% from March to April in what will come as a relief to many people stretching family budgets for the basics. It was the biggest decline in food costs at home since September 2020, the government said. Egg prices fell sharply, declining 12.7%, the most in 41 years. Yet they are still 49% higher than a year ago.

Overall, the report suggests tariffs haven’t yet impacted prices for many items. Economists say the impact will more likely be seen by June or July. The 10% tariff on all goods that took effect April 5 could take two to three months to feed into the inflation data. And many companies built stockpiles of products earlier this year, enabling them to delay price hikes in hopes that the trade war will cool.

The cost of clothing, which is mostly imported, declined 0.2% from March to April, Tuesday’s report said. New car prices were unchanged. And grocery prices fell despite fears that tariffs on some goods from Mexico would boost food costs.

“It’s early days for tariff effects,” said Laura Rosner-Warburton, co-founder of MacroPolicy Perspectives and formerly an economist at the Federal Reserve’s New York branch. “More will come in May, June, and July. There are plenty of price increases already scheduled and on the way.”

And there were some early signs that the duties are having an impact. Computer prices rose 0.3% from March to April, a category that is heavily imported from China and usually sees mild price declines. Sporting goods and toys, where many products are imported, also saw increases. And a category that includes baby strollers and car seats also got more expensive.

Still, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices were also muted, rising 2.8% in April compared with a year ago, the same as in March. On a monthly basis, they increased a mild 0.2%. Economists watch core prices because they typically provide a better read on where inflation is headed.

Rosner-Warburton noted that some prices fell as business weakened, particularly in travel. Air fares and hotel prices dropped noticeably last month, contributing to lower inflation, but that may have been driven by a decline in foreign visitors to the U.S.

Some companies have raised prices and others have said they plan to do so as a result of the duties. Mattel Inc., the maker of Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels cars, said earlier this month it would have to raise prices on some products. The company makes 40% of its products in China.

Tool maker Stanley Black & Decker said it raised prices in April and plans to do so again in the July-September quarter because of higher tariffs. And executives at Procter & Gamble, the consumer products giant that makes household name brands such as Crest toothpaste, Tide detergent, and Charmin toilet paper, said last month it will likely have to pass on higher prices to consumers as soon as July.

Only some early tariffs imposed by Trump were in effect in April, including 25% duties on steel and aluminum and 25% on some imports from Canada and Mexico. Trump’s initial 20% import taxes on goods from China were also in place. The steel and aluminum duties will take time to feed through into consumer products, such as cars, and may not affect retail prices for months.

Trump’s huge 145% import taxes on Chinese goods were reduced to 30% in a deal announced Monday, with some of the higher tariffs on pause for 90 days. Retailers and importers had largely stopped shipping shoes, clothes, toys, and other items when the duties were so high, but many will now resume importing from China, which should reduce the chances of empty shelves this fall.

Yet the additional 30% duties, on top of other import taxes, will likely affect prices. The Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, a trade group, says children’s shoes from China will now pay a nearly 100% tariff, because the latest duties are on top of previous import taxes.

Matt Priest, president and CEO of the FDRA, said that the cost of shipping goods from China will likely rise as many companies scramble to get orders to the U.S. during the 90-day window.

“We’re not out of the inflationary cost woods yet,” he said.

And economists say average tariffs are now at about 18%, roughly six times higher than before Trump took office and the highest in about 90 years.

Consumer prices cooled noticeably in February and March, prompting Trump to claim repeatedly on social media that there is “NO INFLATION.” Inflation has fallen to nearly the 2% target set by the Federal Reserve, the agency charged with fighting higher prices.

The Fed would have likely been gearing up to restart interest rate cuts in the absence of tariffs because inflation is down. It reduced its benchmark rate three times last year. However, it has since frozen rates while it awaits further evidence of how the tariffs — and other policy changes, such as immigration restrictions and potential tax cuts — affect the economy.

The smaller import taxes on Chinese goods will limit the damage to the U.S. economy, but combined with all the other tariffs, economists forecast they will still slow growth this year and worsen inflation.

The Yale Budget Lab, for example, estimates the tariffs will lift prices 1.7% and cost the average household about $2,800 this year.

“This is still a very, very substantial tariff hike, but it will take awhile” to show up in the inflation data, Alan Detmeister, an economist at UBS, said.

Many small businesses are relieved that the U.S. has cut its tariffs on goods from China but say they still aren’t sure what their costs will be for the remainder of this year, or whether they can avoid raising prices themselves.

Rick Woldenberg, CEO of Learning Resources, an educational toy company, said that the 145% tariffs would have pushed his tariff bill to $100.2 million from $2.3 million last year.

He paused shipments and production but is now strategizing how to work with the lower tariffs. He has 13 containers stored in warehouses in Los Angeles, which allows importers to defer duty payments for up to five years. And he may bring $11 million of goods from China and pay the 30% tariffs, but he’s not sure how to price them.

“We just don’t know what our costs are,” he said. “We do not know what our tariff costs are. We do not know what our freight costs are.”

Six in 10 Americans said the economy has affected at least one of their major life goals, according to the Harris poll, citing either lack of affordability or anxiety around the current economy.

Though Donald Trump’s tariff policies have only been in place for a few weeks, and though the president has temporarily walked back on some of his harshest policies, the findings are a sign that Trump’s economic agenda could have long-term effects.

The Trump administration has said it wants to encourage Americans to have more babies, and is floating a $5,000 “baby bonus” for new mothers. But its economic policies appear to be a major stumbling block to that ambition. Of those who originally planned to have a child in 2025, a majority say the current economy has affected their plans in some way, by either being unable to afford having a child (32%) or being uncomfortable having one in the current economy (33%).

Large percentages of those surveyed said they wanted to make major financial decision: 45% said they wanted to make a big purchase – a car, for example, or appliances – and 42% said they wanted to buy a house.

But 75% of those who said they wanted to buy a home said the current economy had derailed them.

Buying a home has long been seen as the benchmark for the American dream, but has become increasingly unaffordable for many Americans.

Home prices rocketed after a buying frenzy during the pandemic, when interest rates were at zero, and have not come down since. Though mortgage rates have fallen slightly since their recent peak of about 7.5%, the average 30-year mortgage rate in March was 6.7% – more than double what it was four years ago.

The economic anxiety disproportionately affects the long-term goals of younger Americans, who are less likely to own a home already, be married or have kids. A majority of Gen Z and millennials renters (68%), for example, said they had a goal of buying a house, compared to just 29% of renters who are older.

Much of the instability appears to come from the rising cost of living: 65% of Americans said they thought the cost of living had worsened since the start of the year, and half said it had made it more difficult to afford their living expenses.

A vast majority (78%) said they had noticed increased grocery prices over the last few months, while 60% said they had also noticed monthly bills and everyday essentials getting more expensive.

Although nearly half (48%) of Republicans said the cost of living has gone up this year, Republicans appear to be more optimistic about the overall state of the economy, particularly compared to when Joe Biden was in the White House.

When respondents were asked last May whether they thought the US was experiencing a recession, 67% of Republicans said they believed the country was in a recession. Nearly a year later, the number has dropped to 40% of Republicans.

On the other hand, 49% of Democrats believed the country was in a recession last May, compared with 59% who think the US is in a recession now. The US is not in recession and has not been since February to April 2020, during the Covid pandemic.

Perhaps most concerning for Trump is that although only 33% of Republicans believe the US economy is worsening, 64% of independents believe it is getting worse, more in line with Democrats (73%). More independents believed that the economy was in a recession last May (53%) compared to this April (46%), though the switch in opinion is much smaller than for Republicans.

Though Trump has said that his tariffs will “make America wealthy again”, it appears few Americans believe him.

Tariffs came out on top in a list of things that Americans believe will most likely hurt their household financially in 2025. Nearly a third (29%) of respondents, including 39% of Democrats, 28% of independents and 21% of Republicans, said that tariffs will do the most harm. Over 20% said that government policies will be the most harmful, including 24% of independents."|"Americans are reconsidering major life events including marriage, having children and buying a home amid economic anxiety in the opening months of the Trump presidency, according to an exclusive poll for the Guardian.

India’s MAJOR S-400 Move ’Spooks’ Pakistan; Team Putin To Send More Air Defence Systems By…

Poll Which approach do you think is more effective in resolving international disputes? Mediation by third-party nations Bilateral talks between involved parties

NEW DELHI: India on Tuesday reiterated its rejection of US President Donald Trump's offer to mediate in the dispute with Pakistan over J&K, and said India had a long-standing national position that any issue pertaining to the Union Territory would be addressed by India and Pakistan bilaterally.""That stated policy has not changed. As you are aware, the outstanding matter is the vacation of illegally occupied Indian territory by Pakistan,"" MEA said when asked about Trump's offer.Government also rejected the US president's claim that he had threatened to stop trade with India and Pakistan to get them to agree to a ""ceasefire"".Also read: 'No mention of trade in India-US talks during India-Pakistan crisis' ""From the time Op Sindoor started on May 7 till the understanding on cessation of military action on May 10, there were conversations between Indian and US leaders on the evolving military situation. The issue of trade did not come up in any of these discussions,"" MEA said.Also, with Trump claiming that he had averted a nuclear war, govt said India's military action was entirely in the conventional domain and warned other countries not to get carried away by Pakistan's nuclear bluff.While there were reports that Pakistan's National Command Authority, which is responsible for the country's nuclear arsenal, would meet on May 10, govt recalled that Islamabad had later on record denied any ""nuclear angle"". May 10 was the day India pounded 8-10 airbases in Pakistan, forcing Pakistan to seek a DGMO-level dialogue.India's armed forces have denied they hit a nuclear site at Kirana Hills, debunking reports about a radioactive leak there.

In conversations with various countries, we cautioned that their subscribing to such scenarios could hurt them in their own region,'' MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.Amid repeated claims by Trump that he had mediated a ""ceasefire"", govt reiterated that the specific date, time and wording of the understanding was worked out between the DGMOs during their phone call at 3.35 pm on Saturday. The request for this call was received by MEA from the Pakistani high commission at 1237 hours, Jaiswal said. ""The Pakistani side had initial difficulties connecting the hotline for technical reasons. The timing was then decided based on the availability of the Indian DGMO at 1535 hours,"" he added.""Early on 10th morning, we had mounted an extremely effective attack on key Pakistan Air Force bases.

27|https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/13/volodymyr-zelenskyy-donald-trump-vladimir-putin-peace-talks-turkey|Trump must realise Putin is obstacle to peace, Zelenskyy says|2025-05-13 00:00:00|"Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he hopes the current period of frantic diplomacy and high-stakes gambits between Russia and Ukraine will end with Donald Trump understanding that Vladimir Putin is the real obstacle to a peace deal.

“Trump needs to believe that Putin actually lies. And we should do our part. Sensibly approach this issue, to show that it’s not us that is slowing down the process,” said Zelenskyy, speaking to a small group of journalists, including the Guardian, in his office at the presidential administration in Kyiv.

Zelenskyy said he would travel to Turkey on Thursday whether or not Putin flew in for talks.

Zelenskyy said he had arranged to meet with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, in Ankara, but would be ready to fly to Istanbul at a moment’s notice if the Russian leader showed up. “If Putin does not arrive and plays games, it is the final point that he does not want to end the war,” he said on Tuesday.

Previously, after Putin used an unexpected late-night Kremlin address to call for direct Russia-Ukraine negotiations in Istanbul, Zelenskyy responded by saying he would be waiting for Putin personally in Turkey on Thursday.

Trump, who is on a visit to Saudi Arabia, appeared to float the idea of a three-way meeting with Putin and Zelenskyy, saying on Monday: “I believe the two leaders are going to be there. I was thinking about flying over.”

Zelenskyy said he was hoping Trump would indeed meet him in Turkey. “If Trump travels, it will push Putin also to travel,” he said. “Trump can really help. It’s the situation where the US being present can give important guarantees.”

Trump’s Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, also suggested the potential for a three-way summit. “This could be a really great meeting … We hope that President Putin will also come, and then President Trump will be there,” he told Fox News. Kellogg, as well as the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and the envoy Steve Witkoff are also reportedly expected in Turkey.

However, there is little sign that Putin is prepared to travel. Although he has not directly ruled it out, comments from the Kremlin suggest Russia will instead send a lower-level negotiating team to Istanbul.

“Our delegation will be there and will wait for the Ukrainian side,” said Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, on Tuesday evening. The Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said Russia wanted to use any talks to address the “root causes” of the conflict as Moscow sees them, including the “denazification” of Ukraine and the official incorporation into Russia of annexed territories – suggesting that the rhetoric of the two sides is still very far apart.

Zelenskyy said he believed that without a ceasefire agreed by the leaders, there was no point in beginning lower-level talks.

“I want you to understand why I would meet with Putin. We are not going to be able to agree on everything now. It’s impossible. We have different approaches to life, different worldviews. But we have to somehow find a way to end the war,” he said. If he and Putin could agree on a ceasefire, Zelenskyy said, then lower-level groups could meet to start hammering out details of the next steps.

He pointed to previous talks in Saudi Arabia, when the Americans acted as intermediaries between Russian and Ukrainian delegations, and a lasting full ceasefire could not be agreed. “Without signals from the leaders, or a meeting of the leaders, this format doesn’t work,” he said.

However, when pressed, he refused to rule out sending a lower-level delegation to Istanbul for talks. “I don’t know. I am being honest. Maybe the Americans, maybe someone will really want to launch this format again. I don’t know,” he said.

The back-and-forth diplomacy began with a visit to Kyiv by the leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Poland on Saturday, timed symbolically to come just one day after a set-piece military parade in Moscow marking 80 years since the Soviet victory in the second world war. After speaking with Trump on the phone, the four European leaders laid down an ultimatum to Putin that he should sign up to a 30-day ceasefire by Monday or face further sanctions. Putin rejected the ultimatum, instead offering the Istanbul talks without a ceasefire.

In the event that nothing is agreed during whatever meetings take place in Turkey this week, the big question is whether the Europeans can bring Trump along with them in their plans to ratchet up the pressure on Moscow. Zelenskyy said he hoped that new sanctions would soon be on the agenda if Thursday’s meetings came to nothing.

“I believe that President Trump is not against imposing sanctions … and I believe that there is political will in Congress to vote for these sanctions. I believe the Americans are very close to imposing these sanctions,” he said. He added that consultations would take place in the coming days – “if you’ll allow me, I won’t say where or when” – in which Europeans would be briefed on upcoming US sanctions plans.

The Ukrainian president has been walking a diplomatic tightrope in recent weeks, as Kyiv tries to keep the Trump administration on side. After the disastrous White House meeting at the end of February, Zelenskyy appears to have had some success turning the relationship around, culminating in a positive meeting on the sidelines of Pope Francis’s funeral in the Vatican last month.

Asked what he had said to Trump to win him back over, Zelenskyy declined to answer: “I won’t tell you. I know the reasons; in my opinion, I know why we had such a good talk. But I can’t say, I just can’t.”

British and French officials have been speaking regularly with Ukrainian counterparts since the White House debacle and offering guidance on how to mend relations with the US administration.

Zelenskyy said the contact with European allies had been closer and more frequent than ever before, and that the French president, Emmanuel Macron, was one of “two or three” leaders whom he spoke with regularly by phone. “He has a very creative approach … He’s a risk-taker. And risk-takers can be different kinds of people, but they are all focused on results. They don’t put themselves above everything else,” Zelenskyy said.

After his visit to Turkey, Zelenskyy is expected to visit Albania for a meeting of European politicians on Friday, and then may travel to Rome, where he suggested he could attend the inaugural mass of the new pope, Leo XIV, after having a positive phone call with him earlier this week.

“I think it could happen on Sunday,” Zelenskyy said. “If it works out. We don’t know what this week will bring. We have come to the moment when we don’t know what will happen tomorrow.”"|"Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he hopes the current period of frantic diplomacy and high-stakes gambits between Russia and Ukraine will end with Donald Trump understanding that Vladimir Putin is the real obstacle to a peace deal.

Addressing a weekly news conference, Randhir Jaiswal, the spokesman for India’s foreign ministry, said top leaders in New Delhi and Washington were in touch last week following the Indian military’s intense standoff with Pakistan, but that there was no conversation on trade.

“The issue of trade didn’t come up in any of these discussions,” Jaiswal said, referring to the conversations held between U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as well as between U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his Indian counterpart, S. Jaishankar.

Following Saturday’s understanding between India and Pakistan to stop military action on land, in the air and at sea, Trump told reporters on Monday that he had offered to help both nations with trade if they agreed to de-escalate.

“I said, come on, we’re going to do a lot of trade with you guys. Let’s stop it. Let’s stop it. If you stop it, we’ll do a trade. If you don’t stop it, we’re not going to do any trade,’” Trump said.

“And all of a sudden, they said, I think we’re going to stop,” Trump said, crediting trade leverage for influencing both the nations’ decision. “For a lot of reasons, but trade is a big one,” he said.

The militaries of India and Pakistan had been engaged in one of their most serious confrontations in decades since last Wednesday, when India struck targets inside Pakistan it said were affiliated with militants responsible for the massacre of 26 tourists last month in Indian-controlled Kashmir. Pakistan has denied any links to the attackers.

After India’s strikes in Pakistan, the two sides exchanged heavy fire along their de facto borders, followed by missile and drone strikes into each other’s territories, mainly targeting military installations and airbases .

The escalating hostilities between the nuclear-armed rivals threatened regional peace, leading to calls by world leaders to cool down tempers.

Trump said he not only helped mediate the ceasefire, but also offered mediation over the simmering dispute in Kashmir, a Himalayan region that both India and Pakistan claim in entirety but administer in parts. The two nations have fought two wars over Kashmir, which has long been described as the regional nuclear flashpoint.

New Delhi also declined Trump’s offer for mediation on Tuesday.

“We have a longstanding national position that any issues related to the federally controlled union territory of Jammu and Kashmir must be addressed by India and Pakistan bilaterally. There has been no change to the stated policy,” Jaiswal said.

Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said late Tuesday that Pakistan was expelling a staff member of the Indian High Commission in Islamabad, accusing him of unspecified inappropriate activity and giving him 24 hours to leave the country.

In a tit-for-tat move last month, India and Pakistan reduced each other’s diplomatic presence in Islamabad and New Delhi. So far, none of the expelled diplomats have returned. Pakistan and India routinely expel each other’s diplomats over allegations of espionage.

Macron also said he was “was ready to open” talks about France sharing its nuclear umbrella with European allies.

“I will define the framework in a very official fashion in the weeks and months to come,” he said.

European allies have been worried about losing protection from the U.S. under President Donald Trump, whose commitment to NATO and keeping American troops in Europe has been called into question.

Macron reiterated that he was not in favor of seizing the €200 billion of Russian assets held in Brussels-based financial institution Euroclear that were frozen after the Kremlin’s full-scale invasion began in February 2022, despite reports that France has reportedly warmed to the idea.

LONDON -- Over a ton of cocaine worth close to nearly half a billion dollars has been seized from a boat off the coast of Australia, officials have confirmed.

Detectives from the Organised Crime Squad in Australia have charged five people following the seizure of the drugs from a vessel off the New South Wales coast after police there obtained potential intelligence to the drugs following a “suspicious purchase” of a 43-foot-long motor cruiser paid for by just cash in Sydney’s Sutherland Shire on April 28, according to a joint statement from the New South Wales Police Force and the Australian Federal Police (AFP).

“On Friday (9 May 2025), as the vessel travelled back to shore - towards South West Rocks - it was intercepted by the Marine Area Command about 9.30am.,” the statement said. “Two men, aged 24 and 26, were arrested on board and escorted to shore by the police vessel. They were taken to Coffs Harbour Police Station.”

Approximately 1,110 blocks of cocaine, weighing 1.039 tons were located on the vessel, police confirmed.

“The seized cocaine equates to over a million individual hits, with an estimated potential street value of $623.4 million,” (more than $400 million U.S. dollars) police said.

Three other people – aged 28, 29 and 35 - were simultaneously arrested on shore after investigators stopped two vehicles attempting to leave the South West Rocks area and they were taken to Taree Police Station.

Forensic specialists are currently examining the seized drugs and will be conducting further testing to determine the exact weight and purity of the drugs.

“The two men at Coffs Harbour were charged with supply prohibited drug - large commercial quantity and participate in criminal group,” Australian officials said. “The three men at Taree were charged with take part in supply prohibited drug - large commercial quantity and participate in criminal group.”

All five of the suspects appeared at Parramatta Bail Court on Saturday where they were all formally refused bail and mandated to appear at Coffs Harbour Local Court on July 15, authorities said.

“The AFP and NSW Police Force have a long history of disrupting criminal networks attempting to import drugs that destroy our community. Combining our resources and expertise allows us to get successful outcomes like the one we are announcing today,” AFP Assistant Commissioner Stephen Dametto said. “Australia’s vast coastline is attractive to organised crime groups, who attempt to exploit this by trying to import drugs using boats. The bad news for them is the AFP will continue to work together with our partners to target organised crime syndicates who wrongly believe they can operate with impunity.

NSW Police State Crime Commander, Acting Assistant Commissioner Jason Weinstein said these arrests are testament to how rapidly our policing resources can coordinate and stop significant amounts of drug coming into NSW.

“Whether on land or sea, NSW Police have the investigative capability to disrupt and undermine criminal enterprise,” Weinstein said. ""This seizure shows how our continuous monitoring of known organised crime methodologies with industry partners, can be actioned into a successful multi-agency operation with those involved immediately arrested to prevent illicit drugs entering NSW. Our ability to pivot and protect the community is evident in this week’s actions. Make no mistake these drugs, if allowed to enter our communities, would have had devastating impacts on people’s lives and social cohesion, particularly in regional townships.”

The higher education minister, James Lawless, will on Tuesday seek cabinet approval for a “global talent initiative” to entice top international academics, including those seeking to leave the US or deterred from working there.

The plan envisages deploying roving academic talent scouts who will offer potential recruits attractive packages, with the Irish government contributing up to half of the salaries offered by Ireland’s third-level institutions. The talent hunt will reportedly prioritise experts in renewable energy, food security, digital technology, artificial intelligence, semiconductors and healthcare.

Lawless told an Irish universities association seminar on Monday: “Today, as US research freedoms come under threat, Ireland has a unique opportunity to emulate their post-war success by offering a stable, open, EU-aligned environment where world-class researchers can thrive, contribute and shape the future of science. Ireland will be a welcoming host for the best and brightest fleeing the US university system.”

Perceptions of the US as a haven for research had changed in recent months, the minister said. “It has become a cold place for free thinkers and talented researchers. We all know how that will grind advanced research to a halt. And that is nothing in the face of the human suffering of targeted student arrests and deportations”. Reports of library culls “bring to mind book burnings of old”, he said.

As a precedent Lawless cited Ireland’s success in enticing Erwin Schrödinger to Dublin on the eve of the second world war. The Austrian physicist helped to set up the Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies (DIAS).

The Irish scheme follows efforts by Belgium’s Vrije Universiteit Brussel, France’s Pasteur Institute and other European institutions to recruit US researchers by offering themselves as a haven for those keen to escape a White House crackdown on research and academia. In March the Netherlands said it planned to launch a fund to attract researchers.

The Trump administration has frozen billions in federal funds for research under in the name of efficiency and punishing alleged anti-semitism and other transgressions in academia. It has been called an “RMS Titanic moment” for American higher education.

The migration of talent might initially benefit only individual, high-profile researchers but there would be an economic effect, Cas Mudde, the Stanley Wade Shelton UGAF professor of international affairs at the University of Georgia, recently wrote in the Guardian. “That might force even the Trump administration to change course.”"|"Ireland is to launch a scheme to poach academics and university lecturers from overseas on the basis that the Trump administration has made the US “a cold place for free thinkers and talented researchers”.

A full and immediate ceasefire between India and Pakistan was announced on May 10 after days of heightened military exchanges that brought both nuclear-armed neighbours to the brink of war.

The announcement was first made by US President Donald Trump and later confirmed by Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

Tensions flared following an April 22 attack in Pahalgam, Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK), which left 26 civilians dead.

On 17 July 2014, Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was brought down over eastern Ukraine. The flight was on its way from Amsterdam (Netherlands) to Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia). 283 passengers and 15 crew members were on board, and all of them died in the crash.

Representatives from the Netherlands, Australia, Belgium, and Ukraine created a Joint investigation team to investigate this airplane crash. Russia rejected its connection to the crime.

In November 2022, The Hague Court announced the verdict for the case of MH17. Two Russian citizens, Igor Girkin and Sergei Dubinsky, and Ukrainian citizen Leonid Kharchenko, were found guilty. The court sentenced them to life imprisonment and approved the payment of compensation.

Also, The Hague Court recognized that Russia has controlled the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic since at least May 2014.

The Netherlands and Australia initiated the dispute in March 2022. They asked the ICAO to assign Russia responsibility and start negotiations between three countries under the organization’s control. Moscow announced its unilateral suspension of participation in the dispute in the summer of 2024.

On May 12, 2025, ICAO voted on the decision, with a “significant majority” of the Council members supporting the Netherlands and Australia’s position. The next step is to indicate the amount of compensation that’ll be asked from Russia.

“This decision also sends a clear message to the international community: states cannot violate international law with impunity,” said Foreign Minister of the Netherlands Caspar Veldkamp.

On May 9, Ukrainian officials, the Council of Europe, and foreign ministers from European countries signed a document about political support of creating a Special tribunal for Russian aggression against Ukraine.

The U.S. will remove all sanctions on Syria, President Donald Trump announced Tuesday. ""I will be ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria in order to give them a chance at greatness,"" Trump told a packed auditorium at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, during the first appearance of his four-day visit to the Middle East ""In Syria, which has seen so much misery and death, there is a new government that will hopefully succeed in stabilizing the country and keeping peace. That's what we want to see,"" he said in a wide-ranging speech that focused on his own time in office and U.S. relations with the Middle East.

""In Syria, they've had their share of travesty, war, killing many years. That's why my administration has already taken the first steps toward restoring normal relations between the United States and Syria for the first time in more than a decade,"" Trump said. Syria has been designated a state sponsor of terrorism by the U.S. government since 1979. Additional U.S. sanctions were imposed on the country in 2004 and again in 2011, after the regime of then-President Bashar Assad launched a brutal crackdown on anti-government uprisings. In the roughly 14 years since, the country has been devastated by civil war, sectarian violence and brutal terrorists attacks, including the Islamic State takeover of parts of the country in 2014 and subsequent Western-led bombing campaign to eradicate the extremist group.

The toppling of the Assad regime during a shock offensive by anti-Assad militia groups in December of 2024 stunned the global community, and brought about the prospect of a new beginning for the devastated country. Syria's new president, Ahmed al-Sharaa — a former al-Qaeda member who describes himself as reformed — currently leads the country's transitional government. Syria remained under myriad international sanctions but those imposed by the U.S. were the most severe, as they applied to third parties as well, deterring other countries and groups from transacting with the country. The United Nations and aid organizations like the International Committee for the Red Cross, as well as the Arab League and other NGOs, pushed for sanctions relief following the devastating 2023 earthquake that hit Syria and neighboring Turkey. In addition to throttling the potential for economic progress, the sanctions hindered the ability of aid agencies and governments to provide rapid humanitarian assistance, those organizations said.

41|https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/13/politics/trump-middle-east-business-invs|Luxury skyscrapers, golf courses and cryptocurrency: Trump’s rapidly expanding Middle East business|2025-05-13 00:00:00|"CNN —

The Trump family’s business ties to the Middle East have more than tripled since the president’s first term in office, a CNN tally of the deals has found, including a slew of new projects announced since he reclaimed the White House.

Amid the ongoing plans for luxury skyscrapers, golf courses and cryptocurrency deals in the region, Donald Trump is traveling to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates this week not only as US president, but also as the patriarch of a family whose business empire continues to expand in that part of the world.

His financial ties to the Middle East have prompted concerns among government ethicists who say it’s difficult to determine whether he’s acting in the best interest of the United States or his pocketbook.

“When the American people elect a president, they expect that person to work for them, not for profit,” said Robert Weissman, co-president of Public Citizen, a consumer rights advocacy group. Such financial links, Weissman and other watchdogs say, create an opportunity for foreign powers to seek to sway United States policy through those lucrative business deals.

But Trump has moved full steam ahead, seemingly embracing the overlap of his personal interests and those of the nation. He’s shown he is comfortable boosting business ventures while in office – and doing so in public view. He set the tone by launching his own meme coin days before taking office, which spiked in value right after Trump offered a private dinner to its top investors last month.

“I’ve always had an instinct for making money,” Trump said in February at a conference hosted by a group launched by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund. During the event, Trump promoted the US as ripe for investment but also touted his personal business achievements.

The Trump projects in the Middle East – many of which have been announced but not yet developed – largely involve licensing agreements with foreign developers that have partnered with the Trump Organization and paid to use the Trump name.

Past presidents have divested their businesses or put them in so-called blind trusts to avoid appearances of self-dealing. Trump has taken a different approach. His assets are in a trust managed by his children, and his son Eric Trump, executive vice president of the Trump Organization, has said the business will be walled off from the office of the presidency to avoid any ethical conflicts.

And while the Trump Organization in January pledged to make no new deals with foreign governments during the president’s second term, a recently announced deal for a Trump-branded golf course in Qatar includes a firm backed by Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund, Qatari Diar.

“Through this collaboration, we look forward to further strengthening Qatar’s position as a preferred destination,” the Qatari government minister who heads that firm said when announcing the venture earlier this month.

Eric Trump said in a press release his organization is “incredibly proud” to expand the Trump brand into Qatar through Qatari Diar, and a separate real estate company, Dar Global. Eric Trump told the New York Times last month Dar Global purchased the land for the golf course from Qatari Diar.

A Trump Organization spokesperson said the company has no affiliation, partnership or engagement with Qatari Diar or Qatar’s government and added that the company’s agreement to brand that project is with Dar Global. “The Trump Organization does not conduct business with any government entity,” spokesperson Kimberly Benza said.

President Trump, who famously said “I want America to win,” has repeatedly sought financial boosts for the US from Gulf nations. His administration boasted about securing a UAE commitment to invest $1.4 trillion in the US over a decade, and Saudi Arabia announced in January plans to expand trade and investment with the US by $600 billion over four years. In March, Trump called for Saudi Arabia to spend $1 trillion in the US.

Still, critics say the actions of Trump and his business in the first few months of his second term demonstrate a willingness to personally cash in on the presidency, and some fear foreign officials have helped him do so to advance their own agendas.

During Friday’s press briefing, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt dismissed a question about whether the president would conduct personal business meetings on his trip.

“It’s frankly ridiculous that anyone in this room would even suggest that President Trump is doing anything for his own benefit,” Leavitt said. “This White House holds ourselves to the highest of ethical standards.”

‘Believing in the Trump brand’

Immediately after a mob of his supporters stormed the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, following his election loss, Trump became a pariah in much of the American business community. Hunkered down at Mar-a-Lago, he was banned from some social media apps. A software company stopped processing payments for his campaign website. Prominent financial firms distanced themselves. Even the hotel bearing Trump’s name in the nation’s capital was virtually empty.

“We live in the age of cancel culture,” Eric Trump said, reacting to those moves shortly after the Capitol riot.

But some business leaders stood by Trump, such as his friends in the Middle East.

“I would welcome the opportunity of expanding our relationship,” Hussain Sajwani, the head of DAMAC Properties, the developer of a Trump golf course in Dubai that opened in 2017, said a week after the January 6 insurrection.

Soon, entities in the region offered new opportunities to the Trump family.

After the PGA canceled its tournament at Trump’s New Jersey golf course, Trump partnered with LIV Golf, a new professional golf circuit backed by Saudi Arabia. The league hosts some of its tournaments at Trump properties, including one in April.

In recent years, Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, widely known as MBS, invested $2 billion in a private equity firm launched by Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner. Kushner and MBS developed a close personal relationship when Kushner served as an adviser to Trump during his first term. Though Kushner said he would not return to the White House, multiple Trump officials and people close to Kushner say he has been informally advising US officials on negotiations with Arab leaders, CNN reported Friday.

In the neighboring nation of Oman, the government’s tourism arm in 2022 partnered on plans to build a Trump-branded resort, along with villas and a golf club, near the capital city of Muscat. Last summer, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. commemorated the launch of the joint venture by dining with Oman’s crown prince near a stage emblazoned with the words, “The Ultimate Power Move.”

While those deals materialized during Trump’s time out of office, his business’s expansion in the region appears to have been supercharged after his electoral win in November.

Dar Global, the real estate firm developing the Oman project as well as other Trump-branded towers announced before the election, has since promoted plans for two additional projects in Saudi Arabia’s Riyadh capital and the golf club in Qatar. Dar Global’s parent company, which is based in Riyadh, has committed to advancing Crown Prince MBS’ ambitious plan to modernize Saudi Arabia’s economy.

“Don’t stop believing in the Trump brand,” Dar Global’s CEO, Ziad El Chaar, said in a speech posted online this month in which he touted one of the projects planned for Dubai.

At that same event, Eric Trump referenced how his organization has done “so many projects” with Dar Global and added, “I’m not going to break any news, but I think there’s a few more to come.” He has separately commended Gulf nations for policies that favor development and reject what he has called “woke cancel culture.”

Just Sunday, President Trump wrote in a Truth Social post that his administration would accept a plane to replace its Air Force One as a “GIFT, FREE OF CHARGE.” Two people familiar with the agreement told CNN the 747-8 was from the Qatari royal family. However, a Qatari official said the plane is technically being gifted from the Qatari Ministry of Defense to the Pentagon, which would retrofit the plane for the president’s use with security features. The plane will be donated to Trump’s presidential library after he leaves office, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. Trump added that the plane will “go directly” to his presidential library after he leaves office. “I wouldn’t be using it,” he said.

Companies in the region have also boosted Trump’s crypto firm, World Liberty Financial. UAE-based DWF Labs announced in April the purchase of $25 million worth of the firm’s tokens. MGX, an Emirati-backed investment firm, agreed to use a cryptocurrency launched by the firm for a $2 billion investment in crypto exchange Binance, according to an announcement from World Liberty co-founder Zach Witkoff, whose father is Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East. The chairman of MGX is the deputy ruler of Abu Dhabi and UAE national security adviser.

That announcement from Witkoff prompted Democratic Sens. Jeffrey Merkley and Elizabeth Warren to press the US Office of Government Ethics to investigate the deal, which they stated could “open our government to a startling degree of foreign influence and the potential for a quid pro quo that could endanger national security,” according to a letter they sent last week.

“These Gulf nations are very actively trying to advance their standing in the world and having the president of the United States both do business in their country and come in an official capacity conveys very significant respectability,” said Noah Bookbinder, president of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. “It may be a win-win for these Gulf countries and for the president and his businesses, but it’s less clear that it’s a win for the American people.”

“This is a very delicate region of the world, where there are really important decisions that need to be made about where to deploy the military, how to engage in peace negotiations, and about economic agreements,” Bookbinder said. “You want the President making decisions based on what’s in the interest of the American people… not based on what’s going to be most helpful to his businesses.”

‘A real risk’

American presidents typically visit one of the country’s closest allies during their first major trip abroad. Since World War II, most presidents have traveled to Mexico, Canada or the United Kingdom, according to the State Department. Not Trump.

In 2017, the newly minted president traveled to Saudi Arabia where he was greeted with a lavish reception. Then, he signed an arms deal with King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud. Though Trump traveled to Italy for the pope’s funeral last month, his first official presidential trip during his second term is again to Saudi Arabia.

The United States and Saudi Arabia have a long history of diplomacy, mainly centered on a shared interest: oil. But Trump’s relationship with Saudi Arabia was particularly close during his first term, and the kingdom, which has faced allegations of human rights abuses, benefitted. When the journalist Jamal Khashoggi – a Saudi dissident and an American resident – was killed and dismembered at a Saudi consulate in Turkey after criticizing the Saudi kingdom, the United States’ Central Intelligence Agency reported that the crown prince was behind the assassination. Trump questioned his own government’s conclusion, instead backing MBS.

“It could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event — maybe he did and maybe he didn’t!” Trump wrote in a statement. The crown prince has denied involvement in Khashoggi’s killing.

Ben Freeman, who directs a foreign policy program at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, noted that geopolitics in the region are extraordinarily complicated and Gulf nations have an array of foreign policy positions that don’t align with those of the US. He said additional deals in the region, depending on the specifics, could create reputational risks for the US and even undermine national security.

“There is seemingly this tit-for-tat where the Saudi regime, especially, makes investments in Trump… and Saudi Arabia is the first destination of his first state trip abroad,” said Freeman. “There’s a real risk that personal interests are trumping the national interest.”

Poland’s government says it is now certain that Russia was behind the fire that last year destroyed Warsaw’s largest shopping centre, Marywilska 44. It also says it has detained some of those responsible.

“We already know for sure that the large fire at Marywilska was the result of arson ordered by the Russian security services,” announced Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Sunday evening, just before today’s first anniversary of the fire.

“The activities were coordinated by a person in Russia,” he added. “Some of the perpetrators are already in custody, the rest have been identified and are being sought. We will catch them all!”

Wiemy już na pewno, że wielki pożar na Marywilskiej był efektem podpalenia na zlecenie rosyjskich służb. Działania koordynowane były przez osobę przebywającą w Rosji. Część sprawców przebywa już w areszcie, reszta została zidentyfikowana i jest poszukiwana. Dopadniemy wszystkich! — Donald Tusk (@donaldtusk) May 11, 2025

Tusk’s announcement was immediately followed by a joint statement from interior minister Tomasz Siemoniak and justice minister Adam Bodnar.

They noted that dozens of prosecutors and police have been investigating the fire over the last year, in cooperation with the authorities in Lithuania, “where some of the [same] perpetrators also carried out sabotage activities”.

“Based on the evidence collected, we know that the fire was the result of arson committed at the request of the Russian security services,” wrote Siemoniak and Bodnar. “We have in-depth knowledge about the course of the arson, as well as the way in which the perpetrators documented it.”

In the early hours of 12 May 2024, a fire broke out at Marywilska 44 that spread quickly and, by the time it had been brought under control a few hours later, had destroyed 90% of the premises. As the centre was closed during the night, no casualties resulted from the fire.

Little more than a week after the fire, Tusk had already declared it was “likely” that Russia was behind it. Earlier this year, he revealed that evidence from Lithuania also pointed to Russia’s involvement.

The fire was part of a series of acts of sabotage in Poland and other countries in the region that the authorities have blamed on Russia, whose intelligence services recruited and hired people living in those countries – often Ukrainian and Belarusian immigrants – to carry out the attacks.

In March this year, Poland charged a Belarusian national, named only as Stepan K. under Polish privacy law, with carrying out a terrorist arson attack in Warsaw on behalf of Russia. They noted that the fire was ignited in a very similar manner to the one at Marywilska, which took place just a month later.

They also revealed that the case against Stepan K. was linked to an investigation into other arson attacks on large stores not only in Poland but elsewhere in central and eastern Europe.

Last year, Poland ordered one of Russia’s consulates to close and its staff to leave the country in response to what it says are acts of sabotage and cyberwarfare being carried out by Moscow.

Zelensky invited Putin to meet in Turkey on May 15 to launch the first direct negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow since 2022, though the Kremlin has not revealed whether the Russian leader would attend.

""Up until now, we have not received an answer or confirmation that President Putin will be in Turkey. But President Zelensky of Ukraine is ready and will go,"" Yermak said in a keynote discussion at the Copenhagen Democracy Summit, in comments reported by Politico.

Yermak said Ukraine is ""ready to discuss anything,"" but ""only if a ceasefire is achieved.""

""We're ready to discuss any options that are on the table. There are many interesting and very strong options. The strongest guarantee is Ukraine's prepared and trained military force, and our partners exactly understand what we need to prevent such a terrible war from happening again,"" he said.

Yermak added that if Putin does not come to Turkey, it will be ""the last signal"" that Russia ""does not want to end the war and is not ready for any negotiations.""

Ukraine and its European allies have urged an unconditional ceasefire starting on May 12 as the first step toward peace. Russia has ignored this proposal, continuing its attacks on Ukraine.

Asked by the Kyiv Independent whether Zelensky plans to make the trip even if Russia does not support the truce or if Putin declines to attend, a source close to the president said, ""We are ready for all options. But of course, we are separately waiting for a response on the ceasefire.""

The last face-to-face meeting between Putin and Zelensky took place in 2019 in Paris during a Normandy Format summit. Since then, there have been no direct in-person meetings between the two leaders.

It was only the other day that scientists warned that residents of Hawaii could soon be dragged towards their doom due to the shore there sinking by around 25mm per year.

That's just the latest in the many, many potentially disastrous consequences of climate change, which has already contributed towards a significant rise in the Earth's temperature, leading to the ice caps melting and the floods that follow.

Advert

While Sir David Attenborough reckons that protecting the sea is the key towards saving the planet, it seems clear that there are a huge amount of problems that need to be solved by Earth's best minds.

Unfortunately, those in charge seem to have a far more blasé attitude towards the potential destruction of our planet, with US President Donald Trump instigating 145 actions to undo rules protecting clean air, water and a liveable climate, all in just his first 100 days back in office.

The UK government are taking a slightly more proactive, if questionable approach, reportedly launching a new £50m project to try and 'dim the sum' recently, in the hope that we can cool down the planet which is rapidly rising in temperature.

And Australia are getting involved too now, although the 'black box' that is reportedly being built in Tasmania is perhaps more a way of recording our own mistakes.

The device will also provide an account of how humanity failed to avoid disaster in the event of a climate apocalypse. Hopefully, some of us will still be around to watch it.

Scientists add: ""Earth's Black Box will record every step we take towards this catastrophe.

""Hundreds of data sets, measurements and interactions relating to the health of our planet will be continuously collected and safely stored for future generations.

They don't exactly sound positive about our chances but they are keen to remind us that we all have a responsibility to reduce our carbon footprint, however, annoying it might be when billionaires take their private jets out for a 10 minute-spin.

The scientists conclude: ""Only one thing is certain, your actions, inactions and interactions are now being recorded.""

50|https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/us-china-trade-tariffs-deal-trump-blinked-rcna206348|The U.S.-China trade ‘deal’ is no deal. The U.S. just blinked.|2025-05-13 13:55:07.721000+00:00|"Last month, U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports skyrocketed to 145%. Some sectors, like cars, were hit particularly hard. Other sectors, like semiconductors, got exemptions. The numbers changed almost as quickly as the justifications, ranging from reshoring jobs to creating a new economic bloc against China.

This weekend, there was a new whiplash as U.S. negotiators announced that they would scale back tariffs to around 30%. In response, China reduced its tariffs on U.S. goods to 10%. Even though the details of the negotiation are still trickling out, the White House is already trumpeting the “Art of the Deal.”

While the U.S. did avoid a major economic calamity, this is not a deal. The U.S. blinked. Welcome to the tariff ""omnishambles.""

The initial round of negotiations thus has undermined much of the leverage that we have for future rounds.

Far from some diplomatic coup, the U.S. climb down reflects the economic risks of maintaining such high tariffs. Activity at West Coast ports had slowed to levels not seen since the pandemic. News from the ports was mirrored in reports of layoffs and bankruptcies among small businesses. Just as bond markets had forced the administration’s hand in April, when it had imposed extreme tariffs against many allies, cutting off trade flows with China had significantly raised the chance of a recession.

While the de-escalation between the U.S. and China will temper some of the worst fears of decoupling, the American economy is far from out of the woods. Reporting suggests that the negotiations provided no new wins in terms of U.S. access to the Chinese markets. And even the 30% tariff level will stoke inflation, as goods from China now face higher taxes than they did a year ago. Equally important, the Trump administration has included a 90-day review window in which the extreme rates could snap back. If you are a business, how can you make any sensible long-term investments? It is just this type of uncertainty that stokes fears of recession.

But for China, the negotiations have revealed the weakness of America's threats. Given that the U.S. was unable to maintain higher tariffs for more than a month, how credible is the proposed snap-back? In many ways, the bargaining dynamics mirror those between the U.S. government and bond markets a month ago. Repeatedly escalating to extremes and then backing down only further reveal U.S. pressure points. The initial round of negotiations thus has undermined much of the leverage that we have for future rounds.

And it is not only that China has learned something about our pain tolerance. As we lick our wounds and restock empty ports with new Chinese goods, Chinese President Xi Jinping is already meeting with Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva to secure new investments and boost Brazilian exports. The administration’s tariff policy has forced the U.S. to scramble to rebuild individual economic ties. Meanwhile, China is playing a global game, diversifying away from U.S. dependencies and going on diplomatic tours trumpeting itself as a free trader.

This leaves many of our closest allies even more confused. At least one of the purported justifications of the tariffs was to create an anti-China economic bloc, and U.S. officials reportedly have tried to pressure countries into reducing their economic ties with China. All the while, however, the U.S. has eliminated traditional incentives like U.S. development assistance that we use to get others on board. Now the U.S.-China negotiations suggest that even the U.S. is not willing to decouple. If that is the case, why would others be willing to risk it?

This leaves many of our closest allies even more confused.

The Trump administration has unleashed one of the most difficult and challenging economic policies of the post-war period; conducting 90 trade negotiations in 90 days is staggering. Now try doing it as you simultaneously fire thousands of State Department workers with key diplomatic and area expertise.

The word omnishambles — popularized in the British political satire “The Thick of It” -- captures a particular type of policymaking characterized by chaos and mismanagement. We are just in the first episodes, but omnishambles is already the clear theme of this show. And while the U.S. has temporarily paused escalation with China, the risks to our economy and global credibility have already started."|"The numbers changed almost as quickly as the justifications, ranging from reshoring jobs to creating a new economic bloc against China.

The dad has reportedly been jailed for 10 years in Saudi Arabia after being stopped by security while preparing to fly back to the UK.

A British father-of-four has reportedly been jailed for 10 years in Saudi Arabia over a deleted tweet from an X account with just 37 followers.

Ahmed al-Doush is understood to have been put in prison following his arrest by Saudi authorities on August 31, 2024, while on a family holiday to the country. The senior business analyst with Bank of America was stopped by security while preparing to fly home to the UK from King Khalid International Airport in Riyadh.

‌



He has now been jailed for 10 years after a state-appointed lawyer told his wife Amaher Nour, that he had been convicted of an offence at a hearing on Monday but that he could not tell her what it was, reports the Mirror.

‌

Amnesty International had said Ahmed was told that charges would be issued against him for using social media to spread fake, untrue and damaging news five months after his arrest, and that he was secondly accused of having a relationship with an individual who threatened national security, reported The Times.

Ahmed's family believe these accusations may relate to a 2018 tweet he made concerning the situation in Sudan, with no mention of Saudi Arabia, which he then deleted.

They also believe that the second accusation is related to his alleged association with a Saudi critic in exile with whom he has no relationship beyond knowing his son. His wife was pregnant at the time of his arrest, before catching a flight back to Manchester Airport, and he therefore missed the birth of his fourth child.

Ms Nour said: ""The authorities asked for his documents and we thought it was just a problem with his visa. He called me from security and told me to fly with the children on to Turkey, our transit stop, and said, 'I’ll be with you shortly'.

‌



“The night times are the hardest for me when I’m alone and it’s quiet. I keep asking myself why, why, why has this happened, and I can’t get to the bottom of it because it’s not rational in any way. He has no political associations.”

Amnesty International says Mr Al-Doush has faced 'multiple violations' to his fair trial rights since his arrest and was subjected to extensive interrogation without a lawyer present and before being informed of the charges against him, reported the Manchester Evening News.

For two months, his family also had no contact with him, nor did they receive information about his condition or the reasons for his detention. His contact with his family and UK-based legal team has continued to be severely restricted.

‌

The case was discussed by the UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy with his Saudi counterpart, Prince Faisal bin Farhan bin Abdullah, though details of their call were not disclosed.

Responding to a letter from human rights group, Reprieve, to Mr Lammy concerning the case, a Foreign Office official wrote on April 2 that “the UK government cannot interfere in another country’s legal processes and must respect their systems, nor can we get British nationals out of jail,” reported The Guardian.

‌



Amnesty International said it was not until November last year that that Mr Al-Doush was able to call his wife and family at one weekly intervals. Sacha Deshmukh, Chief Executive of Amnesty International UK said: “We strongly condemn this sentence and reiterate our urgent call on the Saudi authorities to immediately and unconditionally release Ahmed al-Doush, if he is being held solely for peacefully exercising his human rights.

""He must be allowed to return to his family in the UK without delay. In the meantime, Saudi authorities must uphold his fair trial rights, promptly share his court documents with him and guarantee regular access to both his family and legal counsel.

""We also urge the UK government to take all necessary steps to secure his immediate and unconditional release. The arbitrary detention of another British national abroad cannot be tolerated. Immediate and decisive action is essential.”

Meanwhile, China kept improving its global standing, overtaking the U.S. for the first time and recording mostly positive perceptions in all regions except Europe. Russia, the reputation of which tanked in the wake of President Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, is still (slightly) more unpopular than the U.S. — though its image is also improving.

Trump’s reputation is in line with that of his country. The survey showed he’s less popular worldwide than his Russian and Chinese counterparts, Putin and Xi Jinping.

Trump recorded the worst score among a range of political, cultural and spiritual leaders that includes X owner Elon Musk, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, the late Pope Francis, Taylor Swift and Kim Kardashian.

Israel emerged as the country with the worst global reputation of those included in the poll, especially in the Middle East and South Asia. Israel is unpopular even in European countries that have historically been its allies, such as Germany, signaling growing discomfort with its government’s conduct in Gaza and the West Bank.

Last year, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant over alleged war crimes.

The data used in this story came from an online survey conducted by Nira Data and the Alliance of Democracies between April 9-23, 2025. The sample was 111,273 drawn across 100 countries, with an average sample size of around 1,100 respondents per country.

“It’s a great gesture,” the 78-year-old businessman told reporters at the White House on Monday, when questioned about potential expectations from the oil-rich Gulf state in exchange for the jet.

“I would never be one to turn down that kind of an offer. I mean, I could be a stupid person (and) say ‘no we don’t want a free, very expensive airplane.'” Qatar’s royal family has offered to donate a luxury 747-8 jumbo jet as Trump awaits the delayed delivery of two new presidential planes from Boeing. This move has sparked significant constitutional and ethical debates, along with security concerns regarding the use of a foreign-donated aircraft for the highly sensitive role of Air Force One.

The U.S. Constitution’s Emoluments Clause prohibits government officials from accepting gifts “from any King, Prince or foreign State.”

Trump responded sharply when asked whether he would use the jet for personal purposes after his presidency.

“You should be embarrassed asking that question,” Trump told a reporter. “They’re giving us a free jet. I could say, no, no, no, don’t give us I want to pay you $1 billion or $400 million, or whatever it is. Or I could say, thank you very much.” Trump stated that the jet would instead be donated to his future presidential library as an exhibit, similar to the display of a former Air Force One jet at Ronald Reagan’s library.

Utmost transparency

Trump and the White House maintain that the Qatari jet would be a gift to the U.S. Department of Defense, thereby circumventing constitutional concerns.

Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt assured that the White House would operate with “utmost transparency.”

“The Qatari government has graciously offered to donate a plane to the Department of Defense. The legal details of that are still being worked out,” Leavitt told Fox News.

“But of course, any donation to this government is always done in full compliance with the law, and we commit ourselves to the utmost transparency, and we will continue to do that.”

When questioned about potential quid pro quo from Qatar, Leavitt replied: “Absolutely not, because they know President Trump and they know he only works with the interests of the American public in mind.” Qatar sought to minimize the controversy, clarifying that the jet would not be a gift.

“The possible transfer of an aircraft for temporary use as Air Force One is currently under consideration between Qatar’s Ministry of Defense and the US Department of Defense,” said Ali Al-Ansari, Qatar’s media attaché to Washington.

Democrats, however, swiftly criticized the plan.

“Any president who accepts this kind of gift, valued at $400 million, from a foreign government creates a clear conflict of interest,” stated four members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The statement, issued by Senators Cory Booker, Brian Schatz, Chris Coons, and Chris Murphy, also asserted that the move “raises serious national security questions, invites foreign influence, and undermines public trust in our government.”

Trump has long expressed dissatisfaction with the current Air Force One jets, two highly customized Boeing 747-200B series aircraft that entered service in 1990 under President George H.W. Bush.

Earlier in the year, Trump indicated that his administration was “looking at alternatives” to Boeing due to delays in the delivery of two new 747-8 aircraft.

(Soon after taking office, Mr. Trump contended that Ukraine itself was responsible, contributing to the late-February blowup with President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office.)

Much of the conversation in Istanbul will focus on the control of territory that Russia now occupies, and whether Ukraine has to radically reduce its armaments, and whether NATO needs to pull back both troops and arms near Russian borders. Mr. Zelensky has vowed to attend, adding to the potential for a standoff. As Stephen Sestanovich, a Russia expert and longtime diplomat who wrote a book a decade ago entitled “Maximalist,” noted after a recent trip to Ukraine, ever since the Oval Office argument “the Ukrainians have found a way to combine gratitude with inflexibility and make it work for them.”

But in recent times, Mr. Putin, getting with the program, has dropped hints about joint Russian-American energy and mining operations, tempting a deal-hungry president to get something out of a Ukraine agreement, beyond his search for a Nobel Peace Prize. Mr. Witkoff sounded thrilled with that idea in an interview with Tucker Carlson.

Now the Iranians are trying a similar tactic.

After several weeks of conflicting statements about whether Iran could be allowed to continue enriching uranium, which can fuel a nuclear weapon, Mr. Witkoff said last week, in an interview with Breitbart, “we believe they cannot have enrichment, they cannot have centrifuges, they cannot have anything that allows them to build a weapon.”

The demands seemed pretty clear.

But the Iranians contend that Mr. Witkoff took a far more gentle approach in the negotiating room last weekend, and did not rule out allowing some nuclear activity in Iran. Meanwhile the Iranians, according to several Iranian and other officials, have begun floating ideas for nuclear energy joint ventures, perhaps with the United States, perhaps with Saudi Arabia, their regional rival. The key is all sanctions would be lifted and Iran would preserve some of the capabilities that Mr. Witkoff, and in recent days Mr. Trump, has suggested must be mothballed or dismantled.

On Tuesday in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, Mr. Trump said he was offering Iran “a new path and a much better path toward a far better and more hopeful future.” Then he said: “The time is right now for them to choose."""|"Mr. Putin clearly senses that Mr. Trump cares little about the sanctity of Ukraine’s borders or even who is responsible for the invasion.

but during the Biden administration, the US pushed for Saudi normalisation with Israel as part of a condition for progress on nuclear development talks.

Under Trump, Saudi Arabia's recognition of Israel would not constitute a condition for nuclear talks [Getty/file photo]

The United States is no longer demanding Saudi Arabia normalise ties with Israel as a condition for progress on civil nuclear cooperation talks, two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters ahead of US President Donald Trump's visit next week.

Dropping the demand that Saudi Arabia establish diplomatic relations with Israel would be a major concession by Washington. Under former President Joe Biden, nuclear talks were an element of a wider US-Saudi deal tied to normalisation and to Riyadh's goal of a defence treaty with Washington.

The Gulf kingdom has repeatedly said it would not recognise Israel without a Palestinian state, frustrating Biden administration attempts to expand the Abraham Accords signed during Trump's first term. Under those accords the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco normalised relations with Israel.

Progress towards Saudi recognition of Israel has been halted by fury across the region over the deadly war in Gaza. The nuclear talks had also stumbled over Washington's non-proliferation concerns. In a possible sign of a new approach, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright said that Saudi Arabia and the United States were on a ""pathway"" to a civil nuclear agreement when he visited the kingdom in April.

""When we have something to announce, you will hear it from the President. Any reports on this are speculative,"" US National Security Council spokesman James Hewitt told Reuters in response to a request for comment.

Saudi Arabia's government media office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Even without the normalisation requirement for civil nuclear talks to progress, and despite unpacking the issue from a wider defence treaty, a deal is not yet in close reach, one of the sources said.

One sticking point is Section 123 of the US Atomic Energy Act that allows cooperation with other countries developing civil nuclear capabilities but specifies nonproliferation criteria including limiting uranium enrichment. Saudi Arabia's energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman has said that the kingdom would seek to enrich uranium and sell the product.

One of the sources said the kingdom was still not willing to sign a so-called 123 agreement, which would prevent enrichment or reprocessing of plutonium made in reactors - two routes that have the potential to culminate in nuclear weapons.

Secretary Wright previously told Reuters a 123 agreement would be a prerequisite to any deal.

However, there are several ways to structure a deal to achieve both countries' objectives, Wright has said.

One solution being discussed is a ""black box"" arrangement where only US personnel would have access to a uranium enrichment facility on Saudi soil, the same source said.

Sell more oil

Riyadh wants to build nuclear generation capacity as it seeks to diversify its economy away from oil. Nuclear power could also help free up more crude barrels for export.

Arms control advocates have previously expressed concern about a Saudi nuclear programme because de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has said the kingdom would seek to quickly develop nuclear weapons should its regional rival Iran do so.

The US and Iran are currently holding talks over Tehran's nuclear programme, which Washington and Western allies say is geared towards producing weapons. Iran insists it is purely for civil purposes.

US Vice President JD Vance on Wednesday described the talks with Iran as ""so far, so good"" and said there was a deal to be made that would reintegrate Iran into the global economy while preventing it from getting a nuclear weapon.

Saudi Arabia and the United States are set to discuss a number of blockbuster economic deals during Trump's visit next week, with the US poised to offer Saudi Arabia an arms package worth well over $100 billion, sources have told Reuters. Trump has said Riyadh should ""round up"" a planned investment package in the US to $1 trillion from an initial $600 billion.

The trip is Trump's second visit abroad, after a short trip to Rome for the pope's funeral, since he returned to office in January. In his first term a lavish trip to Saudi Arabia marked his first overseas stop.

Trump fostered close ties with Gulf states including Saudi Arabia during his first term. The country invested $2 billion in a firm formed by Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and former aide, after Trump left office, and there are plans to build two Trump towers in Jeddah and Riyadh."|"US 'no longer demanding' Israel normalisation from Saudi Arabia as part of nuclear talksbut during the Biden administration, the US pushed for Saudi normalisation with Israel as part of a condition for progress on nuclear development talks.

The GVN calls on world governments to address the threat of H5N1 avian influenza by enhancing surveillance, implementing biosecurity measures, and preparing for potential human-to-human transmission.

""Understanding the current landscape of H5N1 infections is critical for effective prevention and response,"" said Sten H. Vermund, MD, PhD, chief medical officer of the GVN and dean of the USF Health College of Public Health at the University of South Florida, USA. ""The virus’ ability to infect both animals and humans, combined with recent genetic changes, underscores the importance of proactive surveillance and rapid response measures.""

The outbreak has affected nearly 1000 dairy cow herds and resulted in more than 70 human cases, including the first confirmed death in the U.S. The U.S. poultry industry is at significant risk, particularly in areas with high-density farming and where personal protective practices may be lacking. The highly pathogenic influenza virus is now circulating in all 50 states and Canada, resulting in the loss or culling of more than 168 million poultry in the U.S. since 2022. While human-to-human transmission is not documented, experts warn that virus mutations and reassortments, or combining two flu viruses, could increase transmissibility.

""Genomic surveillance is pivotal in tracking viral evolution and informing response strategies,” said Marion Koopmans, DVM, PhD, center of excellence director at the GVN and head of the department of viroscience at Erasmus Medical Center, Netherlands. “Continued investment in surveillance at the human-animal interface, and immediate sharing of unusual field observations and sequence data is essential for researchers worldwide to monitor virus dynamics effectively."" Dr. Koopmans is a U.S. and Dutch National Academy of Sciences member. She is highly regarded for her research on emerging infectious diseases and as a scientific advisor to policymakers at national and international levels.

The GVN virologists underscore the need for improved pandemic preparedness, drawing on lessons learned from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and previous outbreaks. They advocate for a multi-faceted approach to pandemic preparedness, which includes:

Enhanced Surveillance: Continuous monitoring of animals, including testing of milk and wastewater and individuals working with infected animals, to track virus evolution that may lead to human-to human transmissibility. The GVN calls for more comprehensive state-wide testing in the U.S. and internationally. Faster Genomic Data Sharing: Accelerating the release of genomic data to track virus evolution and spatial transmission, fostering collaboration among global research networks. Improved Farm Biosecurity: Using personal protective equipment (PPE) and strict farm cleaning protocols to minimize human exposure and prevent virus spread. Preparedness Plans for the Roll-Out of Tests: Advocating for self-administered diagnostic tests for farm workers, supported by healthcare access for frontline medical staff, to enhance early detection. Strengthening Public Health Infrastructure: Increased funding and support for response mechanisms, particularly in high-risk regions, to better manage outbreaks. Investment in Phenotype Prediction from Genetic Data: Invest in predicting the phenotypes of avian influenza viruses from genetic data, as key traits are difficult to predict solely from genomic sequences. Investment in Rapid Vaccine Development: Encouraging the development and rapid deployment of vaccines for humans and animals, focusing on farm workers. Preparedness Plan for the Roll-Out of Vaccines and Therapeutics: Prepositioned clinical studies to rapidly assess the properties of emerging virus strains and potential treatments. Preparedness Plan to Allow for Rapid Clinical Studies: Focus on enabling rapid clinical studies to assess key properties of new pandemic strains, evaluate new vaccines and treatments, and support modeling efforts. International Collaboration: Supporting a coordinated global response to track data, share research, and prepare for emerging viral threats to reduce community vulnerabilities and improve response strategies.

""Initiatives should focus on enhancing biosecurity measures in agricultural settings and educating the public about safe handling of poultry products and potential risks associated with contact with infected animals,"" said Peter Palese, PhD, center of excellence director at the GVN and Horace W. Goldsmith Professor of the department of microbiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Dr. Palese is a world leader in influenza research and a U.S. National Academy of Sciences member.

“Given the growing circulation of H5N1 among mammals, the GVN calls for urgent efforts to understand and interrupt transmission in cattle through herd management and potential vaccination,” said Ab Osterhaus, DVM, PhD, center of excellence director at the GVN and founding director of the Center of Infection Medicine and Zoonosis Research at the University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Germany. “Strengthening surveillance at animal-human interfaces is crucial, as current monitoring efforts are insufficient to guide effective prevention strategies.” Dr. Osterhaus is internationally regarded for his work on animal viruses, SARS, MERS, and H5N1. He is a co-founder of the global One Health Community, and a Dutch and German National Academies of Sciences member.

While some surveillance of H5N1 has been carried out, the GVN highlights the lack of comprehensive testing and monitoring to assess the virus's spread and risks to public health.

“A robust nationwide monitoring system is essential to quickly detect, and quarantine affected animals and implement preventive measures to curb further spread and human infections,” said Elyse Stachler, PhD, member of the GVN and a research scientist at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, USA. “Further, we believe it is crucial to maintain trust and stakeholder buy-in for monitoring programs, particularly from farm workers.”

""We are advocating for community-driven strategies to ensure the successful implementation of vaccines, if necessary,” said Christian Bréchot, MD, PhD, vice chair of the board of directors and president emeritus of the GVN and director of the Microbiomes Institute and senior associate dean for research in global affairs in the USF Health Morsani College of Medicine, USA. “The situation with H5N1 demands heightened vigilance and collaboration across public health sectors. Early detection and robust surveillance are critical to prevent further spread.""

""But the dots tell a story,"" immunologist Gigi Gronvall says about the two prints she framed and hung behind her desk at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.

One image shows the meticulous mapping of a London-based cholera outbreak in 1854 by British physician John Snow, whose work pinpointed the source of the sickness: a contaminated water pump in the Soho district. ""The prevailing theory at the time was that cholera spread through air,"" Gronvall says of Snow's groundbreaking work. ""But by gathering and mapping the data, Snow uncovered what we know to be true today—cholera spreads through contact with sewage and feces.""

Dots delineate a different infectious disease in the other, more complex image. There, arrows point up and down and sideways to pink, black, and blue circles, squares, and triangles, tracking viral and genetic material gathered in January 2020 from animals and stalls at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, China. A data visualization from a paper in the journal Cell (September 2024), the intricate markings reveal the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in the materials tested.

For Gronvall, a national security expert and senior scholar at the Center for Health Security, every study like this contributes to our body of scientific knowledge and reminds us, in this case, of a pandemic that led to the loss of more than 7 million people worldwide and trillions of dollars from the U.S. economy. People associate pandemics with the risks posed to human health, but they affect all aspects of society, she says. ""That's another reason we need to figure out how COVID started and what we can learn from it.""

Although the scientific community lacks consensus on whether COVID-19 originated in the Wuhan market or elsewhere, most scientists agree on another matter: We can expect more pandemics to come, owing to factors like climate change, mass migration, globalization, and human encroachment on wildlife and insect ecosystems. According to the center's director Tom Inglesby, who served in COVID-related advisory roles during the pandemic at the White House and in the Department of Health and Human Services, ""as temperatures change, people are moving around the world more rapidly than ever before … and intruding into ecosystems that used to be made up entirely of animals or insects."" This, in turn, creates opportunities for humans to get infected by new diseases and disease strains.

We can expect more pandemics to come, owing to factors like climate change, mass migration, globalization, and human encroachment on wildlife and insect ecosystems.

Another factor contributing to the likelihood of future pandemics are the concentrations of people living in megacities like Tokyo, Delhi, and Shanghai—to name three on a fast-growing list of cities with more than 10 million inhabitants. ""In some, people live incredibly close together without great sanitation, creating conditions for rapid spread, Inglesby says."" This happened last year, for instance, in the Democratic Republic of Congo's capital city Kinshasa, home to 17 million. There, a new, more contagious strain of a disease typically confined to rural areas, mpox, spread quickly. As a result, mpox now poses a threat not only to Kinshasa and the DRC but also the world, given the international flights going in and out of Kinshasa daily.

Over the past few decades, public health experts have watched infectious diseases spring up and evolve in surprising ways. That's a main reason the Center for Health Security was created in the first place, Inglesby says of the group that started in 1998 and has helped fight anthrax attacks and other bioterrorist threats, plus outbreaks of swine flu (H1N1), yellow fever, the Ebola and Zika viruses, and COVID-19.

Chances are, Inglesby says, experts won't be able to predict the next pandemic. It could be the bird flu ravaging U.S. cattle and poultry farms and infecting humans. It could be Zika or dengue fever, spread by mosquitoes, or another strain of influenza or coronavirus. ""No one really knows,"" he says. ""That's why we need to heed lessons from the past and prepare.""

Today, five years after COVID-19 spread to every continent on Earth, killed millions, and left roughly 400 million people with brain fog, breathing difficulties, and other symptoms of long COVID, Inglesby and others want to share and highlight the lessons learned to better prepare us for the next one that will inevitably occur.

Much of what they learned relates to the months leading up to the pandemic, ""a critical window of opportunity to do everything you can to contain the disease,"" Inglesby says. It involves decisions made at the executive level to combat a fast-spreading new virus, along with the timeline and manner in which officials share information and deploy countermeasures. It also involves the steps taken—or not taken—to contend with misinformation, which Gronvall, who teaches a class on the 1918 influenza virus that killed roughly 50 million, says we can count on transpiring in all pandemics.

""We'll be unpacking COVID for decades to come, with doctoral students and scholars poring over the data,"" Gronvall says. But with other pandemics on the horizon and COVID-19 continuing to mutate and cause lasting complications for people with and without chronic health conditions, experts say our country can't ignore what it learned and put its head in the sand.

Lesson 1: Prepare for the worst

On Jan. 1, 2020, epidemiologist Caitlin Rivers opened her inbox to find an email from the disease outbreak surveillance system ProMED, sent one minute before midnight.

""I have a bad feeling about this,"" the senior scholar at the Center for Health Security thought to herself, unintentionally channeling the famous Star Wars line.

The email reported a cluster of pneumonia-like cases of unknown cause in Wuhan, the sprawling capital city of central China's Hubei province, with a population of 11 million. Government officials in China hadn't yet reported the illnesses, but the low-tech email service ProMED had pieced together the news from active chatter on Weibo, a Chinese microblogging site.

Following ProMED's alert, media outlets worldwide started reporting on the strange sickness that turned out to be the novel coronavirus, COVID-19. But according to a report by the nonprofit research institution Project Information Literature, other stories dominated the U.S. news cycle, such as the Senate's impeachment trial of President Donald Trump and the tragic death of basketball star Kobe Bryant. ""Buried deeper in the news flow were reports of a mysterious flu spreading through China,"" the report reads. ""To the Americans who followed this story, this threat seemed safely distant.""

But faculty at the Center for Health Security saw clear warning signs and took swift action. In a Foreign Affairs article published on Jan. 31, 2020, Inglesby reminded the world of a tenet of public health: preparation is the key to an effective response, or, as Benjamin Franklin put it, ""By failing to prepare, you prepare to fail.""

According to Inglesby, as evidence mounted in January that the novel virus could morph into a pandemic, ""governments [worldwide] needed to act immediately by organizing for the worst-case-scenario and turning on all required systems""—a tall order that involves stockpiling diagnostic tests and protective equipment, readying hospitals and health care workers, preparing schools and teachers, and pooling resources and teams to develop a vaccine, therapeutic drugs like antivirals, and the manufacturing supply chain to produce and distribute these products in record time.

""If, for some miraculous reason, a pandemic didn't occur, then the extra work would leave us better prepared for the next one,"" Inglesby says.

Did the right people listen?

Some pockets of the federal government ""were quietly, extremely concerned and doing what they could to prepare,"" Inglesby says. But the government's main effort involved regulating travel from China, with passengers facing health screenings and potential quarantines.

More travel restrictions and bans followed, measures that experts say did little to prevent the spread of a virus already widely circulating. According to Inglesby, ""there should never have been an assumption that shutting down travel was a foolproof strategy. People were moving around the world all the time, and it was too late.""

George W. Bush ""A pandemic is a lot like a forest fire. If caught early it might be extinguished with limited damage. If allowed to smolder, undetected, it can grow to an inferno that can spread quickly beyond our ability to control it.""

In February 2020, as COVID cases multiplied, Inglesby attended a federal government meeting with health care system leaders. ""People were worried, but the meeting was more like a brainstorming session, instead of [an action plan] to start implementing specific steps to prepare hospitals and health care workers,"" he says.

Why no plan?

Pandemic preparedness had been a federal priority since 2005, when President George W. Bush devoted $7 billion to the cause. ""A pandemic is a lot like a forest fire,"" Bush told scientists at the National Institutes of Health. ""If caught early it might be extinguished with limited damage. If allowed to smolder, undetected, it can grow to an inferno that can spread quickly beyond our ability to control it.""

The Obama administration continued the work, taking an aggressive approach to the Ebola epidemic in 2014 and establishing a global health security directorate (through the White House's National Security Council), with a mission to prepare for and, if possible, prevent the next outbreak from turning into an epidemic or pandemic. The directorate [created a 69-page playbook, delineating how to guide government sectors through the complex work of fighting health threats.

In 2018, however, the Trump administration dismantled the directorate, claiming it was overstaffed and needed streamlining. Some staff members merged with other groups, while others left their positions, resulting in what the directorate's former leader Beth Cameron described as a diminished federal workforce devoted to monitoring and mitigating disease spread when COVID broke out.

""In a health security crisis, speed is essential,"" Cameron wrote in a March 13, 2020, op-ed for The Washington Post. ""When this new coronavirus emerged, there was no clear White House-led structure to oversee our response, and we lost valuable time.""

For a country as large as the U.S., creating a unit to oversee and coordinate global health security, with backing from senior government officials, is essential, experts say.

Inglesby agrees. Fighting a disease, he explains, ""involves tremendous coordination among not only government sectors but also private companies, nonprofits, and countries and organizations worldwide. It requires a structured, strategic approach.""

Lesson 2: Deliver information, not reassurance

Sometimes it makes sense to withhold information or quell fear with words of reassurance. When a friend suffers a loss, one might say, You'll get through it. Everything will be OK.

When it comes to a health threat, however, placating the public isn't the right strategy, experts say, and it's a lesson Inglesby and Rivers hope the country will take from the pandemic.

When it comes to a health threat, placating the public isn't the right strategy.

""The job of public health and political leaders should never be to overly reassure,"" Inglesby says. ""The job is to be factual and to provide maximum information to people and their families so they can make good judgments and lower their own risk of spread.""

But as Rivers explains in her recently released book, Crisis Averted: The Hidden Science of Fighting Outbreaks, senior officials downplayed the threat in the weeks before and after COVID became a pandemic. Alex Azar, the secretary of Health and Human Services at the time, announced at press briefings in late February that the risk to the American public remained low, while President Trump tweeted that the health threat had been ""inflamed ... far beyond what the facts would warrant.""

For Rivers and others monitoring the situation, ""the risk to the United States was anything but low … [yet went] unnoticed by most of the public and [was] actively denied by elected leaders,"" she says. That's why, when the U.S. declared a national emergency on March 13, the country was caught off guard.

Rivers, in Crisis Averted, stresses the importance of sharing information in a straightforward, timely manner. ""Clarity is a core tenet of public health messaging,"" she writes. Delivering bad news is difficult, and even the best health officials sometimes use ""opaque language"" and ""fuzzy jargon"" to soften the blow. The problem with these approaches, however, is that they don't ""give the listener any sense of the magnitude of the problem, or any direction about how concerned to be,"" she says.

Instead, people can more easily grasp information delivered in plain language with concrete examples, Rivers continues. This is a goal of public health messaging, but it mostly went unmet early in the pandemic.

As Inglesby explains it, ""the more we're in the mode of dismissing or downplaying the [situation] or of reassuring people, the more anxious they're going to get,"" and the more susceptible they'll be to misinformation.

Instead, people need specific information and evidence-based advice about their own circumstances. ""Some of us face higher risks than others, whether we're elderly or have an underlying condition, or we have a grandmother living with us,"" he continues. ""Everyone needs practical guidance.""

Lesson 3: Admit the unknown

""Science is slow,"" says Gigi Gronvall, sitting at her desk one morning in front of the images that remind her of the knowledge and benefits a society can reap when scientific breakthroughs occur. ""But science is far more effective than jumping to conclusions.""

During the pandemic, with schools and businesses closed and loved ones getting sick and dying, ""no one wanted to wait for information or be told what they could and couldn't do,"" she says. ""No one liked the disciplinarian,"" and public health became an easy target.

According to a study by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, 57% of leaders of local health departments surveyed nationwide became targets of harassment between March 2020 and January 2021, with droves of practitioners opting to leave their positions. ""Constrained by poor infrastructure, politics, and the backlash of the public they aimed to protect, public health officials described grappling with personal and professional disillusionment, torn between what they felt they should do and their limited ability to pursue it,"" the study reports. ""For some, the conflict was untenable.""

Why did public health become the scapegoat of a nation on lockdown?

From Inglesby's perspective, the backlash stemmed partly from an over-reliance on the CDC to make decisions beyond the scope of its expertise. ""The CDC is full of talented scientists, but as a health research agency, it wasn't set up to respond 24/7 to questions from the government and policymakers about matters of logistics and economic and societal tradeoffs, such as whether to close schools and businesses and cancel events,"" he says. ""These are political and civil-society decisions that require a collaborative effort, with people representing various interests weighing in to determine the best course of action.""

Founded in 1946 to stop the spread of malaria, the CDC serves as the nation's leading public health agency, responsible for providing scientific guidance on the spread of infectious diseases. The Atlanta-based agency is staffed with epidemiologists, virologists, and other experts in disease control and prevention, not in areas like economic growth and K-12 education. When asked, in the summer of 2020, to provide guidance on the return to school for students and teachers, the CDC submitted a report to the Trump administration indicating that the move would pose risks to a country experiencing 40,000 to 100,000 new cases of COVID every day—and to a nation with an already-overwhelmed health system.

The administration pushed back on the report, and many blamed the CDC for keeping kids out of school. According to Inglesby, however, the CDC was simply doing what it was set up to do: offering guidance on the matter, as it relates to curtailing harm done by the virus. ""It became all too easy to blame [the agency] for a decision that needed experts in additional areas to weigh in,"" he says.

The backlash on public health also stemmed from the learning curve involved in combatting a wily new virus behaving in unpredictable ways, experts say. ""We didn't have all of the answers, and new scientific evidence was emerging all the time,"" Inglesby explains. ""A study would be completed or half-completed. A new variant would be identified, and the message to the public would change.""

One example: face masks.

Early in the pandemic, scarce information existed on whether masks could stave off COVID-19, so officials didn't suggest wearing them. That changed, however, as data revealed that masks slow down the disease transmission, leading the CDC to alter its guidance. ""Some political leaders and members of the public accused the CDC of reversing positions and [lacking competence],"" Inglesby says, referring to the allegations of ""flip-flopping"" that resounded nationwide. ""What was missing from the conversation, however, is that changes are inevitable in an agency devoted to scientific research—that's the nature of what researchers do."" They gather evidence and conduct studies, shifting recommendations as they narrow in on the truth.

How public health officials present information makes a difference, experts suggest. ""The public doesn't want to hear heavily scientific explanations, just as they don't want to be told everything will be OK, without any specifics,"" Inglesby says.

Gronvall recommends an approach comparable to a police chief speaking at a press briefing. ""The key is to strike a cadence that reinforces a message along the lines of, 'This is what we know right now, and it's why we recommend X precaution. When we learn more and if the guidance changes, we'll update you right away.'""

This way, the message comes across not as a command from all-knowing experts but as an open sharing of evidence-based information for people to use—or not use—to make decisions. The choice stays with the individual, who becomes an informed partner in protecting their health and that of their loved ones.

Lesson 4: Get ahead of misinformation

Tara Sell, a senior scholar at the Center for Health Security, specializes in misinformation—and its ability to turn people away from life-saving health advice. During the pandemic, she mined social media and networking forums for misleading posts about everything from face masks and social distancing to vaccines and anti-viral treatments.

""Misinformation eroded millions of people's trust in public health,"" Sell says. ""It will take a lot of work to rebuild it.""

From her research, she discovered that misinformation stemmed in part from partisan politics. ""Whether to wear a mask, whether to get a vaccine—those choices became tied to people's political identity, which wasn't good for the public and brought consequences that continue today,"" Sell says. Since the pandemic, for example, at least 30 states have passed laws to limit public health authority, and health officials in many of those states can no longer issue mask mandates or close schools.

Tara Sell Senior scholar, Center for Health Security ""Whether to wear a mask, whether to get a vaccine—those choices became tied to people's political identity, which wasn't good for the public and brought consequences that continue today.""

Gronvall says that partisan media outlets fueled misinformation by giving airtime to anchors who contradicted health guidance and sowed doubt among viewers. On Tucker Carlson Tonight, for instance, Carlson spoke out repeatedly against vaccines, going so far as to compare President Biden's vaccination plan to the lethal and torturous medical procedures imposed by the Nazis during the Holocaust. In 2021, he referred to the vaccine as ""the greatest scandal in my lifetime, by far,"" and openly discouraged his roughly 3 million viewers from getting vaccinated.

The media's influence on health compliance during the pandemic hasn't been thoroughly studied, Gronvall says, and she worries the breeding ground for misinformation still plagues us. ""As a society, we haven't addressed the financial forces that went into dismantling public health messages and dissuading people from protecting their own interests,"" she says.

Sell agrees, adding: ""Misinformation is a predictable part of health emergencies, so much so that we'll know what to look for the next time around.""

From her research, Sell noticed striking similarities among misinformation spread during COVID and other crises. For example, tales of infertility nearly always crop up, with reports of, say, a vaccine preventing women from conceiving or delivering a healthy baby. False claims abound about health treatments that use children as guinea pigs, along with conspiracy theories about a government's ill intentions or a pharmaceutical or tech company's financial greed.

Society's most susceptible members often fall prey to the messages. ""Pregnancy and early motherhood, for instance, are vulnerable times for women,"" Sell says. ""You've got a lot of things you don't know, and so you search the internet for information and find a lively audience talking about things that speak to your situation. You get hooked.""

To share what she learned, Sell and her colleagues worked with the CDC to produce a playbook for directors of local health departments to use to identify and address misinformation. The playbook includes instruction on things like how to address rumors, frame messages, and connect with communities to build trust and partnerships.

""As health scholars, we tend to look at situations through the lens of case numbers and infection rates, but other people's values also matter,"" she says. ""We need to step out of our bubbles. We need to listen with empathy.""

The next one

During the 1918 influenza pandemic, as the deadly disease ravaged one battalion after another on the battlefields of World War I, governments went to great lengths to hide the circumstances, fearing the news would lower morale and lead enemy forces to take advantage of the depleted troops.

In the U.S., President Woodrow Wilson signed into law the Espionage Act of 1917, preventing anyone from documenting or discussing anything that would disadvantage the country's military position. The following year, Wilson passed the Sedition Act, a more stringent measure that made it illegal—and punishable by a 20-year imprisonment—for anyone to write, publish, or utter a word that might hinder the U.S. war effort. This, of course, meant keeping quiet about the strange illness killing millions on U.S. soil and across the Atlantic.

Perhaps not surprisingly, Wilson's suppression of free speech fostered a breeding ground for misinformation about a virus that became known, incorrectly, as the ""Spanish flu."" A neutral country in World War I, Spain was among the only countries reporting deaths and illnesses caused by the virus. Word spread that the virus originated there.

Studies reveal that ""the 'Spanish flu' most likely started at a military camp in Kansas,"" says Gronvall, who teaches a class on the 1918 pandemic at the Bloomberg School of Public Health.

Gronvall says her students chime in regularly with stories about COVID—and similarities between the pandemic they experienced firsthand and the one they're learning about in class. She talks to students about rising threats like H5N1, a matter that weighs heavily on those at the Center for Health Security.

At the time of this writing, H5N1, a strain of influenza spread by wild birds and highly contagious and lethal in poultry, continues to wreak havoc on the U.S. poultry and cattle industries, having infected commercial and backyard poultry flocks in all 50 states and cattle herds in at least 16, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the CDC. Seventy humans have tested positive, including veterinarians and others with no known contact with infected cows or birds, ""which suggests we're missing cases,"" Gronvall says. Mammals are also contracting the disease, with H5N1 showing up in red foxes, racoons, bobcats, and even domestic cats, among other animals.

""I'm chronically worried,"" Inglesby says about H5N1. ""There's no evidence right now that it can spread from human to human but that could change in ways that allow it to transmit efficiently between people.""

If that happens, the outcome could be disastrous. ""The lethality of H5N1 infection in a new epidemic would depend on the exact strain, but in the past, there was very high lethality in humans infected with this virus,"" Inglesby explains.

Experts say that the U.S. needs to prepare not only for H5N1 but also for the slew of other infectious diseases with epidemic or pandemic potential. ""We live in an age of pandemics and have to count on an increase in infectious disease outbreaks,"" Inglesby says. ""We have to create [the infrastructure] to develop medicines and vaccines rapidly and surveillance systems that can make quick diagnoses.""

No such pandemic response system exists right now, and it can't happen by the hands of a single country—it requires a global effort, Inglesby indicates.

Since the bird flu broke out in the U.S. in 2022, world experts have been watching what many considered a lackluster response by the Biden administration to contain the disease. Diagnostic testing for H5N1 is in short supply, and in many states, testing cattle isn't mandatory. Infected but asymptomatic cattle can go unnoticed, and farmers who fear economic or other repercussions (roughly half of U.S. farmworkers are undocumented immigrants) may be reluctant to report sick cattle and unable to seek medical care if they fall ill themselves, owing to a lack of health insurance.

""The country needs to remove barriers that get in the way of farmers reporting illness or seeking help,"" Inglesby says. In 2024, the U.S. Department of Agriculture ""implemented a financial incentive for farmers who report illnesses. That's a step in the right direction.""

Still, the number of cattle and humans with H5N1 probably far surpasses the number of cases reported, Inglesby suspects. And the coordination it will take to combat a virus that affects both humans and animals is ""much more complicated than fighting COVID because of the collaboration it takes between the USDA and CDC,"" he says.

A vaccine for the strain of H5N1 running rampant across the U.S. doesn't yet exist, though pharmaceutical companies such as Moderna and Pfizer are working on it. Roughly five million doses of an older vaccine that targets other bird flu strains exist, but those haven't been made available to farmers, who face the most risk.

""Did we learn nothing from COVID?"" Gronvall wonders.

Right now, efforts are underway to restructure, shrink, and limit the powers of the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, the CDC, and practically all government agencies, with budget freezes halting medical research and public health initiatives. ""This is incredibly worrisome for several reasons,"" Inglesby says, ""including what it's doing to public health budgets at the state level, which rely on money from the CDC.""

Gronvall says the abrupt slashes to research and public health budgets, combined with cuts to services that advance and protect human health, are arriving as our country and world face an unprecedented health threat, with more to come.

""We don't know enough about H5N1 or other viruses with epidemic or pandemic potential, and we need to learn,"" she says, gesturing to the pair of images on the wall behind her, the two emblems of acumen gained through data collected and analyzed. ""The only way is through research.""

Emily Gaines Buchler is a senior writer at Johns Hopkins University."|"""In some, people live incredibly close together without great sanitation, creating conditions for rapid spread, Inglesby says.""
Over the past few decades, public health experts have watched infectious diseases spring up and evolve in surprising ways.
""No one liked the disciplinarian,"" and public health became an easy target.

What if scientists had developed a universal coronavirus vaccine in the years prior to 2020 so that it was available at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic? A universal coronavirus vaccine targets parts of the virus that are common to either many or all coronaviruses, thereby offering some degree of protection against a range of strains. A new study suggests if such a vaccine were available at the start of the pandemic, it could have saved millions of lives, prevented suffering, and saved billions of dollars in direct medical and other costs until the strain-specific (i.e., SARS-CoV-2) vaccine went through the entire development, testing, and emergency use authorization process that lasted 10 months.

In the study, researchers from the Public Health Informatics, Computational and Operations Research (PHICOR) group, the CUNY Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy (CUNY SPH), and the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) show that having a universal vaccine at the start of the pandemic would have had substantial health and economic benefits under almost all scenarios tested. The study was published Jan. 11 in the Lancet’s eClinicalMedicine.

In order to determine the value of investing in developing and stockpiling a universal coronavirus vaccine, the team developed a computational model that simulated the entire U.S. population, the introduction and spread of a novel coronavirus like SARS-CoV-2 in 2020 and the resulting health (e.g., infections, hospitalizations) and economic (e.g., direct medical costs, productivity losses) outcomes. The experiments simulated what would happen if a universal coronavirus vaccine was available at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Vaccinating with a universal coronavirus vaccine as a standalone intervention (e.g., no face mask use or social distancing) was cost-saving even when its efficacy was as low as 10% and only 10% of the U.S. population received the vaccine. For example, when a universal coronavirus vaccine has 10% efficacy, vaccinating a quarter of the U.S. population within two months of the start of the pandemic averts an average of 14.6 million infections and saves over $27 billion in direct medical costs. Such low vaccine coverage at the start of the pandemic could occur if a vaccine were only made available to certain high-risk subpopulations (e.g., 65 years and older, those with weakened immune systems, frontline workers), similar to the approach when mRNA vaccines became available in December 2020.

“COVID-19 was the third major and serious coronavirus epidemic or pandemic following SARS in 2002 and MERS in 2012, thus, we should anticipate a fourth coronavirus outbreak within the next decade or so,” says Peter J. Hotez, MD, PhD, dean of Baylor’s National School of Tropical Medicine and co-director of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development. “A universal vaccine is cost-effective and cost-saving and a priority for advancement.”

A universal coronavirus vaccine was also shown to be highly cost-effective even if a more specific and more efficacious vaccine came to market. For example, the study shows if it takes four months or longer for a strain-specific vaccine to reach the market, using a universal vaccine was still cost cost-saving. In a scenario where a strain-specific vaccine has 90% efficacy but is unavailable for two months after the start of the pandemic, the results from the model show that vaccinating only 10% of the population with a universal vaccine that has 10% efficacy at the start of the pandemic can save over $2 billion in societal costs (e.g., direct medical costs and productivity losses from absenteeism). Given the time required to develop a strain-specific vaccine during a pandemic to match circulating strains of the virus, this highlights the importance of having a universal vaccine readily available as a stopgap.

“Our study shows the importance of giving as many people as possible in a population at least some degree of immune protection as soon as possible,” explains Bruce Y. Lee, MD, MBA, executive director of PHICOR and professor at CUNY SPH. “Having a universal vaccine developed, stockpiled, and ready to go in the event of a pandemic could be a game-changer even if a more specific vaccine could be developed three to four months later.”

Generally, results from the model found that a universal vaccine would end up saving money if the cost to get a person vaccinated (e.g., cost of the vaccine itself, distribution, administration, storage, research, and development) is as high as $10,390 from a societal perspective.

The two-day simulation, Exercise Polaris, tested WHO’s Global Health Emergency Corps (GHEC), a framework designed to strengthen countries’ emergency workforce, coordinate the deployment of surge teams and experts, and enhance collaboration between countries.

The exercise simulated an outbreak of a fictional virus spreading across the world.

Participating countries included Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, Denmark, Ethiopia, Germany, Iraq, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Mozambique, Nepal, Pakistan, Qatar, Somalia Uganda and Ukraine, with additional countries as observers. Each country participated through its national health emergency coordination structure and worked under real-life conditions to share information, align policies and activate their response.

Regional and global health agencies and organizations, including Africa CDC, European CDC, IFRC, IOM, UNICEF and established emergency networks such as the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, the Emergency Medical Teams initiative, Stand-by partners and the International Association of National Public Health Institutes, worked together to support country-led responses. More than 350 health emergency experts connected globally through this exercise.

“This exercise proves that when countries lead and partners connect, the world is better prepared,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “No country can face the next pandemic alone. Exercise Polaris shows that global cooperation is not only possible – it is essential.”

Throughout the simulation, countries led their own response efforts while engaging with WHO for coordination, technical guidance and emergency support. The exercise provided a rare opportunity for governments to test preparedness in a realistic environment, one where trust and mutual accountability were as critical as speed and capacity.

“The exercise sought to put into practice the procedures for inter-agency response to international health threats. Efficient coordination and interoperability processes are key to guaranteeing timely interventions in health emergencies,” said Dr Mariela Marín, Vice Minister of Health of Costa Rica, thanking the Pan American Health Organization for their support and the members of the National Risk Management System for their engagement.

“Polaris demonstrated the critical importance of cultivating trust before a crisis occurs,” said Dr Soha Albayat from Qatar. “The foundation of our collaborative efforts is significantly stronger than in years past. We've moved beyond reactive measures, and are now proactively anticipating, aligning, and coordinating our cross-border emergency response plans.”

“The Global Health Emergency Corps has evolved into a powerful platform, building on practice, trust and connection,” said Dr Mike Ryan, Executive Director of WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme. “Exercise Polaris showed what is possible when countries operate with urgency and unity supported by well-connected partners. It is a strong signal that we are collectively more ready than we were.”

At a time when multilateralism is under pressure and preparedness is often framed through a national lens, Exercise Polaris reaffirmed that health is a global issue."|"The two-day simulation, Exercise Polaris, tested WHO’s Global Health Emergency Corps (GHEC), a framework designed to strengthen countries’ emergency workforce, coordinate the deployment of surge teams and experts, and enhance collaboration between countries.

Instead, all six flu pandemics that have occurred since 1889 emerged in spring and summer months. And that got some University of Texas at Austin scientists wondering, why is that?

Based on their computational model that mimics viral spread during flu season, graduate student Spencer Fox and his colleagues found strong evidence that the late timing of flu pandemics is caused by two opposing factors: Flu spreads best under winter environmental and social conditions. However, people who are infected by one flu virus can develop temporary immune protection against other flu viruses, slowing potential pandemics. Together, this leaves a narrow window toward the end of the flu season for new pandemics to emerge.

They report their findings today in PLOS Computational Biology.

Each of the six flu pandemics since 1889 emerged in the Northern Hemisphere after the flu season (dashed lines), rather than during the peak of flu season. An average of several flu seasons is represented by a curve, with a peak in activity typically between late December and early March. Spencer J. Fox

The researchers’ model assumes that people infected with seasonal flu gain long-term immunity to seasonal flu and short-term immunity to emerging pandemic viruses. The model incorporates data on flu transmission from the 2008-2009 flu season and correctly predicted the timing of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.

Using the supercomputers at the Texas Advanced Computing Center, the scientists used their model to run thousands of simulations in which new pandemic viruses emerged at different points throughout the flu season. They found that the combination of winter conditions and cross-virus immunity indeed led to spring and summer pandemics.

“We don’t know when or where the next deadly flu pandemic will arise,” says Lauren Ancel Meyers, a professor in the Department of Integrative Biology and principal investigator of the study. “However, the typical flu season leaves a wake of immunity that prevents new viruses from spreading. Our study shows that this creates a narrow, predictable window for pandemic emergence in the spring and early summer, which can help public health agencies to detect and respond to new viral threats.”

Future research may focus on more precisely characterizing the cross-strain immunity that impedes pandemic emergence during the normal flu season. Scientists may also explore how these pandemic risk patterns manifest in the Southern Hemisphere and tropical regions.

The charges carry potential sentences of more than a decade in prison.

The fraud scheme targeted two programs meant to feed hungry children, which were funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture but administered by the state of Minnesota. The system relied on nonprofit groups called “sponsors” to be its watchdogs. They were supposed to oversee individual kitchens and feeding sites and make sure they were not inflating the number of children they served.

When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, the federal government flooded money into the program — trying to reach children who were out of school and therefore unable to rely on school lunches. The government also relaxed oversight, putting even more trust in the watchdogs.

In this case, prosecutors said, one of those watchdogs went bad.

Ms. Bock ran a sponsor nonprofit called Feeding Our Future. Prosecutors said she had conspired with dozens of people to set up 250 nonexistent feeding operations around Minnesota and used her oversight power to hide that network from the government. By law, Ms. Bock’s nonprofit got a cut of the money. Prosecutors said it had eventually totaled $18 million.

Many of the fake operations submitted invoices for implausibly large numbers of children: Mr. Said’s operation, for instance, said it had fed 6,000 a day, more than all the children in its ZIP code. In another instance, a man said he was feeding 5,000 children a night — from a location that turned out to be a second-floor apartment."|"They were supposed to oversee individual kitchens and feeding sites and make sure they were not inflating the number of children they served.

73|https://ourworldindata.org/historical-pandemics|What were the death tolls from pandemics in history?|2023-12-07 00:00:00|"What were the death tolls from pandemics in history? Pandemics have killed millions of people throughout history. How many deaths were caused by different pandemics, and how have researchers estimated their death tolls?

COVID-19 has brought the reality of pandemics to the forefront of public consciousness. But pandemics have afflicted humanity for millennia. Time and again, people faced outbreaks of diseases — including influenza, cholera, bubonic plague, smallpox, and measles — that spread far and caused death and devastation.

Our ancestors were largely powerless against these diseases and unable to evaluate their true toll on the population. Without good record-keeping of the number of cases and deaths, the impact of outbreaks was underrecognized or even forgotten. The result is that we tend to underestimate the frequency and severity of pandemics in history.

Often, we have records of epidemics occurring in some countries but lack good records from other regions despite knowing that the geographical impact of the disease would have been very wide. Additionally, we often lack knowledge about which pathogens caused outbreaks and, thus, if a historical event can be considered a pandemic or if it consisted of parallel outbreaks of different diseases.

To deal with the lack of historical records on total death tolls, modern historians, epidemiologists, and demographic researchers have used various sources and methods to estimate their death tolls — such as using data from death records, tax registers, land use, archaeological records, epidemiological modeling, and more.

In this article, I present the various methods they rely on and visualize the estimated impact of what are now considered the major pandemics in history.

What is a pandemic?

Although there is no universally accepted definition of a pandemic1, diseases called pandemics share several characteristics.

Pandemics generally refer to diseases with a vast geographic range — such as spreading across a continent or multiple continents. In addition, they tend to describe outbreaks that are rapidly growing or expanding in range, highly infectious, affecting a large number of people, and caused by novel pathogens against which there is little or no pre-existing immunity.2

How do researchers estimate the death toll of pandemics?

Researchers have estimated the death tolls of pandemics in different ways, depending on the data available.

Some death tolls have been estimated by looking at excess deaths: researchers estimate the additional number of deaths that occurred during a pandemic compared to the expected number of deaths in a typical year. This can be helpful to understand the pandemic’s overall impact, even if records from death certificates are unavailable.

For some pandemics, death tolls are estimated from the net population reduction, where researchers calculate the difference in population size before and after the pandemic. This is often used for severe events — such as the Columbian Exchange — where a significant fraction of the population died.

Some death tolls have been estimated through epidemiological modeling — based on knowledge of the transmission of the disease and its geographical spread, its fatality rate (the share of people affected who die from it), access to treatment, and other types of data.

Finally, some death tolls have been calculated only using recorded deaths (also referred to as ‘confirmed deaths’). This is the number of deaths officially reported with the disease as their cause of death. This method may vastly underestimate the number of deaths caused by the pandemic, as comprehensive historical records are lacking. Even today, cause-of-death registration is lacking in many parts of the world, which is one reason why the number of confirmed deaths from COVID-19 is much lower than the total death toll from the pandemic.

A timeline of historical pandemics

I have brought together estimates of death tolls from different pandemics in history for this article, which we have visualized in a timeline below.

The size of each circle represents one pandemic’s estimated death toll. Pandemics without a known death toll are depicted with triangles.

This overview shows us the vast impact that pandemics have had over history.

You can see that the largest pandemics — such as the Black Death — killed more than half of the population. Several pandemics have swept through the population repeatedly: in just the last two hundred years, seven major pandemics were caused by cholera, and another seven were caused by the flu.

Pandemics devastated millions and left a shadow on those who survived. The suffering they caused may once have felt inescapable.

Before the formation of germ theory, we lacked good knowledge of pathogens that caused them, how they spread, and how to protect ourselves from them. Before molecular testing to analyze pathogens’ genomes, we lacked a good understanding of how they evolved and changed over time.

Our ability to respond to pandemics has been transformed by advances in scientific understanding but truly depends on a wide range of efforts — from data collection to research and communication, public health efforts, healthcare access, and cooperation.

For example, the collection of death records allowed scientists to discover how cholera spread and how to prevent it. Coordination to address HIV/AIDS has prevented millions of deaths worldwide. Global testing for new influenza strains has helped adapt flu vaccines each year.

With better understanding, resources, and effort, much more progress can be made. The world can respond more swiftly and effectively to pandemic risks and avoid and reduce the impact of future pandemics. But without such efforts, we will continue to face major pandemics as we have experienced so far.

Dataset and sources The full dataset and sources used in the chart can be found in our spreadsheet.

In the appendix below, I review some of the major pandemics in history and their historical impact and describe how their death tolls have been estimated.

Appendix: Major pandemics in the last millennium

The Black Death

The Black Death (1346–1353 CE) — one of the earliest pandemics with a methodically estimated death toll — killed around 50–60% of Europe’s population, approximately 50 million people, in just 6 years.3

Researchers have established that many people also died elsewhere — as large outbreaks are also recognizable in historical records from Western Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa — but comprehensive estimates of the global death toll are not available.

Population censuses were not conducted then, so our understanding of the Black Death’s impact in Europe comes from historical records such as tax and rent registers, parish records, and archeological remains. However, uncertainty remains, as these records come from a limited number of European regions and are extrapolated to the rest of the continent based on demographic estimates.

Careful examination of these sources has led to historians revising estimates of the death toll upwards4 and confirmed the bacterial cause of the pandemic: Yersinia pestis (Y. pestis).5

People in the fourteenth century were unaware of this bacterium, nor did they know how it was transmitted — from rat fleas to humans — as this was long before the development of germ theory in the late nineteenth century.6

Without this knowledge, they also had little understanding of how to protect themselves, resulting in the relentless spread of the Black Death. Even after its initial wave, the pandemic continued with frequent, though smaller outbreaks until around 1690.7

Y. pestis caused diseases known as “bubonic” and “pneumonic” plague, where patients experienced fevers, chills, vomiting, and excruciating headaches, and distinctive “buboes” formed in their swollen lymph nodes — typically in the groin, thighs, armpits, or neck.

As Y. pestis spreads through the lymph nodes, it emits toxins that break down blood vessels and form clots, potentially blocking blood circulation and leading to death.8

Other bubonic plague pandemics

It is now recognized that the Black Death was not the only plague caused by Y. pestis. Genetic evidence suggests that this bacteria emerged at least 4000 years ago.9

The first known bubonic plague pandemic began in 541 CE and had recurrent outbreaks until the mid-8th century. This devastating pandemic affected the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire), the Middle East, North Africa, and the Mediterranean.

The initial and most severe outbreak, known as the “Justinianic Plague” (541–549 CE), was named after Emperor Justinian, who ruled Constantinople then.10

The third pandemic occurred between 1894 and 1940, mainly affecting Asia and Africa.

Bubonic plague is less common today due to improved sanitation and hygiene measures which reduce the density of rats and rat fleas, improved public health surveillance, and effective antibiotics, but cases have been seen even in recent years in different continents, mainly in small towns and villages.11

The Columbian Exchange

The chart shows the immense impact of the “Columbian Exchange”, with an estimated 48 million deaths.

The Columbian Exchange describes the period following Christopher Columbus’s voyage to the Americas in 1492 — during which populations, ideas, and crops, such as tomatoes, potatoes, and maize, spread between the Americas and the rest of the world.

But the Columbian Exchange also involved extensive war, conquest, slavery, and the spread of multiple deadly diseases, which led to the devastation of indigenous populations.12

Smallpox, cholera, measles, diphtheria, influenza, typhoid fever, bubonic plague, and other diseases had already killed many in Europe. But they tended to be more severe to Native Americans, who had been previously isolated from these diseases and lacked immunity to them.

The immense death toll shown on the chart is calculated as a “net population reduction” compared to the pre-1492 population size.

The Native American population was estimated to be around 54 million before Columbus’s arrival. Over the following century, around 48 million died, and the population declined to 5.6 million in 1600 — a reduction of about 90%.

Both numbers are estimated by compiling data from a range of sources, including archeological records, tribal records, censuses, epidemiological modeling, and land and crop use.13

Influenza pandemics

Influenza (flu) pandemics arise through sudden evolutionary changes in flu viruses when different strains combine to form novel flu strains14, which can be more infectious and lethal than previous ones.

Although flu has affected humanity for thousands of years15, comprehensive death tolls have only been estimated for the flu pandemics in the last 140 years.

The largest — the 1918 “Spanish flu” pandemic — has an estimated death toll of 50 to 100 million.16 This estimate is a compilation of various historical sources, including recorded death tolls and estimates of excess deaths from different regions.

You can read more about the impact of the Spanish flu pandemic in our article:

The Spanish flu: the global impact of the largest influenza pandemic in history The Spanish flu pandemic had a devastating impact on the global population.

The chart also shows the estimated impact of other significant flu pandemics: the 1889 “Russian flu” pandemic (an estimated 4 million deaths), the 1957 “Asian flu” pandemic (2 million), the 1968 “Hong Kong flu” pandemic (2 million), and the 2009 “Swine flu” pandemic (100,000 to 1.9 million deaths).17

Their death tolls have been estimated from excess mortality during pandemics compared to the years immediately before and after, using available national mortality records and extrapolation to the global population.

Cholera pandemics

As the chart shows, seven cholera pandemics have occurred in the last two centuries.18 Most are considered to have originated in the Indian subcontinent and expanded across countries and continents through war, travel, and international trade.19

Our knowledge of the total global death toll from cholera in history is limited20, but historical reports from across the world suggest an immense impact of the disease. For example, between 1865 and 1947, at least 23 million people died from cholera in India alone.21 But significant outbreaks have been recorded in many more countries.22

Cholera is particularly severe because, if left untreated, the bacteria Vibrio cholerae can cause severe dehydration and death within hours or days of the first symptoms.23

Its severity has been reduced with a range of scientific advances: the understanding that cholera spread through contaminated water and food, and thus that clean water and sanitation could prevent it; the identification of Vibrio cholerae as the cause; the development of antibiotics; and the knowledge that severe forms of the disease could be substantially reduced with simple rehydration treatment.24

Cholera continues to kill, even today. Since 1960, over 900,000 deaths have been recorded from cholera globally as part of what’s considered the “seventh cholera pandemic” — this is shown in the chart.25

When HIV/AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) was first identified in the early 1980s, it had a fatality rate of 100%, and patients had a median survival time of about one year after being diagnosed.26 It spread rapidly as the world grappled with recognizing, understanding, and responding to the growing epidemic.

HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, attacks white blood cells — which are critical for our immune function — and leaves patients vulnerable to a wide range of opportunistic infections and diseases.

Learn more on our page on HIV/AIDS:

HIV / AIDS A global epidemic and the leading cause of death in some countries.

The timeline shows the enormous and continuing impact of HIV/AIDS, which has resulted in an estimated 33 million deaths worldwide between 1981 and 2022.

Our understanding of its death toll comes from available data and statistical modeling. The estimates consider various factors, such as characteristics of the virus’s transmission, behavioral and clinical data, the availability of treatment, and recorded deaths from countries with high levels of death registration. 27

The global response to HIV/AIDS has involved international cooperation, resource allocation, and scientific advances in antiretroviral therapy, which together have transformed HIV from a fatal diagnosis to a manageable chronic condition with treatment.

In recent years, around 1.5 million deaths have been averted annually due to the effects of antiretroviral therapy — which prevents the virus from replicating and thereby reduces the severity of the disease and its spread to other individuals.

This is shown in the chart below, along with the estimated number of HIV/AIDS deaths that still occur — around 600,000 deaths annually in recent years.

The COVID-19 pandemic was caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which emerged at the end of 2019 and rapidly evolved into a global health emergency. Characterized by its highly infectious nature and severe respiratory symptoms, COVID-19 has led to widespread illness and fatalities across the world.

The timeline above shows the vast global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic — with around 27 million excess deaths between January 2020 and November 2023.28 This makes it one of the deadliest pandemics of the last century.

COVID-19’s death toll has been measured by excess mortality, which describes the number of deaths above what would have been expected based on previous years.

This method is used because the global number of confirmed deaths from COVID-19 (those where COVID-19 is listed as the cause of death) is certainly much lower than the total number of deaths from COVID-19. This is because, in many countries, testing for COVID was very limited throughout the pandemic, and cause-of-death registration was, and still is, lacking in many countries.29

Excess mortality also has the advantage of not only considering deaths directly caused by the virus but also those indirectly caused by the pandemic’s impact on healthcare systems and economies.

Learn more about excess mortality here:

Excess mortality during the Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19)

To estimate excess mortality, researchers use national mortality data from countries where data is available and statistical models — which rely on data on COVID-19 testing rates, confirmed cases and deaths, population age structure, state policies, and more — for other countries.

The estimated death toll we show for COVID-19 — 27 million deaths by November 2023 — comes from The Economist. The main reasons why I am relying on The Economist’s estimates are that they are continuously updated, and their methodology is well documented.

In contrast, while the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) have also estimated the number of excess deaths, their latest estimates were only based on the time period until the end of 2021. For this time period, all three sources provide similar estimates (18.2 million deaths were estimated by the IHME; 14.8 million deaths were estimated by the WHO; and 17.8 million deaths were estimated by The Economist).30

The chart below shows the excess mortality during COVID-19, as estimated by The Economist, along with the number of confirmed deaths. As you can see, there is wide uncertainty around the total number of excess deaths during the pandemic. However, even the lowest estimates are much higher than the number of confirmed deaths — reflecting the limited amount of testing and death registration globally during the pandemic.

Despite publication of numerous pandemic planning recommendations, little or no specific guidance about the types of items and quantities of supplies needed has been available. The primary purpose of this report is to detail the approach of 1 healthcare system in building a cache of supplies to be used for patient care during the next influenza pandemic. These concepts may help guide the actions of other healthcare systems.

To help our healthcare system prepare for a pandemic, a multidisciplinary group of experts drawn from within the VA system were empaneled to help bridge the gap between policy and procedure. Among the most challenging tasks was the development of a prioritized list detailing supplies and the essential quantities that should be stockpiled. This report aims to provide detailed example of 1 healthcare system’s approach to building a cache of supplies for the next influenza pandemic and to help identify critical gaps in knowledge that must be addressed for adequate preparedness.

In December 2005, the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), which has governance over the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States, directed its medical centers to make detailed pandemic influenza preparations. This directive was ushered in by a guidance document ( 7 ) that broadly defined the goals and expectations of individual VA medical centers and provided a framework for planning and preparedness. Steps taken by medical centers, including decisions about stockpiling items, were determined by leaders at the local level.

Numerous guidance documents call for stockpiling certain supplies that might be needed to care for influenza patients during a pandemic ( 3 – 6 ). Just-in-time supply chains and standard operating procedures may be insufficient to meet demand as the number of cases increase ( 3 – 6 ). Healthcare systems have been challenged to determine the medical supplies that should be procured. Despite publication of numerous pandemic planning recommendations, little or no guidance has been available about this topic.

Preparations for the next influenza pandemic have captured a remarkable amount of attention, effort, and fiscal funding since 2004, when the scientific and public health communities became increasingly concerned about the emergence of a novel influenza virus (H5N1) infecting humans in Eurasia ( 1 ). Many feared the occurrence of an outbreak on the scale of the 1918–19 pandemic, during which one third of the world’s population became infected and as many as 100 million persons died ( 2 )

Many items purchased for the cache had expiration dates. Although most items had multiple-year shelf lives, some shelf lives were as short as 1 year. The variability of manufacturer-ascribed expiration dates and other reasons for supply rotation led to the recognition that the cache would become a dynamic component of medical system supplies. Items would need to be inspected regularly and rotated through the storage facility on a regular basis. To meet this need, a human resource commitment of 1 full-time employee equivalent would be necessary for logistics management of the inventory. Duties of this person would include inspecting the inventory, assisting with incoming and outgoing deliveries, rotating items into the routinely used supplies of the medical system to ensure use before expiration, and prodding physical security for the inventory. This person would also be charged with developing and maintaining a plan for transportation and deployment of the inventory in the event of a pandemic. In addition, each medical facility would also be required to provide an employee to help manage the inventory and who would report to the cache in the event of a pandemic.

Storage of supplies proved to be among the most resource-intensive components of cache-building. Although initial wishes were to store a cache on the campus of each medical center, the space necessary was too large for most VA institutions to accommodate. After extensive discussion and careful analysis of options, a decision was made to store pandemic supplies in a 10,000–square foot, temperature-controlled, leased warehouse. Quoted costs for space ranged from $10 to $14 per square foot per year ($100,000–$140,000 per year for 10,000 square feet). The recommended location was near an airport to ensure efficient transport of supplies either by tractor trailer or by air cargo. A back-up emergency generator was included to maintain air-conditioning in the event of a power failure.

Purchasing items in large quantity through a prenegotiated agreement enabled a discount off retail prices. However, despite this contract, back-order delays occurred (and would be expected to occur during a pandemic) for several key items. One supplier of personal protective equipment indicated that shipment would be delayed by 6–9 months, affirming predictions of shortages of personal protective equipment. This experience underscored making purchases well in advance of the date when the items were expected to be used for patient care.

The calculated cost of purchasing all essential items for a population of 500,000 amounted to ≈$11 million. Despite efforts to prioritize the items into 3 categories, the calculated cost of category A items far exceeded the amount of funds available. The PIPC debated the best approach and recommended that the available funds be used to purchase a percentage of category A items and that future funds would be used to purchase additional category A items and decreasing percentages of category B and category C items. For example, the funds available at that time were sufficient to purchase 12.5% of category A items. Upon the availability of future funding, perhaps an additional 7.5% of category A items would be purchased along with 5% of category B items and 2.5% of category C items.

Because limited financial resources were available, the PIPC was asked to establish a prioritization scheme. Although every item on the list was considered important, each was subcategorized into purchase priority A, B, and C; A was the most important ( Table 5 ). To arrive at the category level, the following scheme was used. Category A was personal protective equipment, basic life-support items (intravenous fluids, oxygen), and first-line antimicrobial drugs. Category B was second-line antimicrobial drugs, ventilator supplies, sedatives, nebulizers and β-agonists, home care packs, and morgue packs. Category C was disposable ventilators, proton pump inhibitors, and vasopressors. Antiviral medications and vaccines were not included in this list because it was expected that the VA would acquire and maintain a centralized cache of oseltamivir, and vaccine availability and effectiveness were unknown.

We estimated the per patient–encounter needs by staff category ( Table 3 ) and the number of healthcare worker contacts per patient, per day, for each type of healthcare setting ( Table 4 ). In a similar fashion, supply needs were estimated per patient encounter (for outpatients) or per patient-day of care (for inpatients) ( Table 3 ). The ascertained supply and medication needs were combined in a spreadsheet to estimate the needs of each facility and for our network. Spreadsheet formulas enabled the needs of each facility or healthcare system to be easily modified by using the number of individually enrolled patients ( Table 5 ).

Among the gaps in knowledge regarding pandemic influenza is the mechanism of human-to-human transmission of influenza ( 10 ). The Institute of Medicine recommendation ( 10 ) to consider all transmission routes probable and consequential was accepted. Precautions against standard, contact, droplet, and airborne transmission ( 13 ) were incorporated into the plan. We assumed that sole use of disposable N95 respirators would be prohibitively expensive or otherwise not possible because of global shortages ( 14 ). Instead, we decided that staff with prolonged periods of exposure (e.g., physicians, nurses, respiratory technicians, selected housekeepers) would be issued and that just-in-time fit testing, a reusable elastomeric half-face mask with 3 sets of filters, would be used. We estimated that we would need ≈1,000 of these masks and reusable goggles for each 50,000 patients served (on the basis of the size and catchment population of one of our medium-size facilities). Disposable masks would be limited to the beginning of the pandemic and to personnel with infrequent exposure. Using these principles, we calculated the workload, supplies, and medication required to care for typical influenza patients. Accordingly, estimates were produced for the average needs of influenza patients requiring >1 types of services, including outpatient, inpatient medical ward, or ICU settings with or without mechanical ventilation.

Length-of-stay figures were needed to calculate supply needs because resource use is more accurately calculated by patient-days of care instead of number of admissions. We used some of the assumptions made by FluSurge version 2.0 as follows: average length of stay (not in ICU) of 5 days per patient, an additional 10 days for those requiring an ICU stay, and an average time receiving mechanical ventilation of 10 days.

Once the number of patients was established, we used the US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) 1918-scale pandemic model ( 11 ) ( Table 2 ) and FluSurge version 2.0 software ( 12 ) ( Table 2 ) to estimate the number of persons who would be expected to seek care, be hospitalized, admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), or be treated with mechanical ventilation ( Table 2 ). The only modification to the DHHS model was in the proportion of the population likely to contract influenza. The model calls for 40% disease incidence for children, 20% for healthy adults, and a somewhat higher incidence for elderly persons. Therefore, 25% seemed like a reasonable number for the VA, an institution that does not provide healthcare to children. We based calculations on the population likely to request care, not on the physical or personnel capacity of our facilities. It was our assertion that physical capacity would be increased and standards of healthcare would be lowered, as necessary, during a pandemic to permit serving as many people as possible. We acknowledge that alternate sites of care might become available during a pandemic. However, we viewed this possibility as too unpredictable to include in our assumption model.

Most tools estimate effect on healthcare facilities based on population size, but we were dealing with a subpopulation of veterans that may seek care at the VA facilities or at any other community resource. In addition, VA facilities may open their doors to nonveterans during a pandemic. We decided, arbitrarily, to define our universe of patients as the number of individually enrolled persons who sought care at VA facilities during the previous fiscal year. This figure enabled us to calculate system and facility needs in a standardized fashion.

PIPC members recognized that the uncertainty surrounding a pandemic would require a series of assumptions and that any assumption would include some guesswork. To minimize errors, available historical data and guidance from governmental institutions were used to estimate the effect on our healthcare system.

The PIPC agreed on a set of basic philosophical principles that guided our pandemic preparation efforts. During a pandemic, the first priority would be to provide the best possible care to patients while maximizing healthcare worker safety. Essential and relatively affordable patient care supplies and medications meant for basic life support (e.g., intravenous fluids, oxygen, and antimicrobial drugs) would be purchased first, and more expensive, technologically advanced life support (e.g., mechanical ventilation) equipment would be purchased when additional funds become available. This approach to balancing utilitarian and deontologic decision making is discussed elsewhere ( 8 , 9 ). Vaccines and antiviral drugs would not be relied upon as primary means of intervention because their availability and effectiveness during a pandemic remain uncertain ( 4 , 10 ). Although plans to acquire, store, distribute, and administer these countermeasure supplies would be made when possible and necessary, we acknowledge that these plans would not be relied upon as primary countermeasures in most pandemic scenarios.

The VISN 8 leadership appointed a multidisciplinary team to a pandemic influenza planning committee (PIPC) ( Table 1 ) that was tasked to ensure a coordinated and consistent planning and response effort across the VISN. Although the committee had many responsibilities, the focus of this report is limited to the framework developed to estimate supply needs.

The 1,400 medical facilities in the national VA healthcare system are decentralized into 23 Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs), each representing a specific region of the nation. The concepts described in this report are based on actions taken by staff in VISN 8, which includes southern Georgia, most of Florida, and all of Puerto Rico, and provides healthcare for ≈500,000 veterans. Regional network offices help integrate the activities of the medical facilities included in each VISN. Local medical center leaders are primarily responsible for the activities at each hospital and its affiliated outpatient clinics.

Discussion and Recommendations

Despite the numerous uncertainties posed by pandemic influenza, the types and quantities of essential items that should be stockpiled can be estimated by using a reasoned approach. What is offered in this report is a method to calculate the components of a stockpile by using assumptions that are drawn from previous pandemics. This method enables modification of figures, making them scalable and adaptable to any size population. By following the logic of the proposed calculations, it should be possible to modify the assumptions and other figures as needed for almost any community or healthcare system.

Perhaps the most important limitation with this method is a reliance on assumptions. No one knows what the next pandemic will bring. We believe that it is better to plan for a more severe event that will leave the system overprepared than to risk being underprepared. However, this approach may be viewed by some as unnecessary or too expensive. A stratified purchase plan, in which a fraction of essential items is purchased periodically, is recommended on the basis of availability of funds. Some may favor purchase of all items in 1 category before moving to the next category.

The formation and management of a pandemic supply cache would require considerable human and financial resources. The level of commitment may be viewed by some healthcare systems as too costly, especially in an era of economic instability and healthcare system instability likely requiring major reform. Some of the more resource-intensive components of the proposed approach, such as the storage of items in a staffed central facility, were facilitated by the large size of our healthcare system and available resources. Achieving a similar product in the private sector, where healthcare systems are typically much smaller than those in the federally managed VA, might require a partnership among multiple healthcare systems in a region.

One of the most common and widely held misconceptions we encountered was the notion that a healthcare system could be stressed to the breaking point, such that a large surge of patients could eventually render a hospital unable to function. It is our view that in reality, healthcare systems are designed to operate in a graded fashion. Although it is theoretically conceivable that a catastrophe could cause hospitals to cease functioning, it is much more likely that they will continue functioning, even under the most ominous circumstances (15–17). What will change is the standard of care that is delivered; many patients may have access to less resources than would normally be available (18,19). Stockpiling supplies should help prepare for a downgraded level of care that becomes inevitable as resources are increasingly stretched. A key message taken from our experiences was that supplies need to be ordered far in advance of a pandemic to avoid major problems with back orders and supply shortfalls.

The estimated cost of purchasing all supplies and medications needed to provide healthcare to a population of 500,000 during a wave of an influenza pandemic, including negotiated and contracted prices, was ≈$11 million, or approximately half that amount if one only considers purchasing priority A items. This amount is considerably higher than the amount estimated elsewhere (20). This difference may stem from the way we calculated our needs: we did not assume that we could reach a full capacity. Instead, we attempted to estimate the population that is likely to seek care and assumed that under the dire circumstances of a severe pandemic facilities would decrease standards of care, open alternate sites of care, and creatively care for those patients who came for treatment. We also did not assume that we would have a shortage of personnel to care for these patients. Through altered standards of care; emergency privileging and cross-training of healthcare workers, volunteers, and other persons willing and able to care for our patients, a temporary and substantially changed workforce would be expected to emerge.

Numerous gaps in knowledge were encountered. The mechanisms of human-to-human transmission of seasonal and pandemic influenza are poorly understood. Numerous articles have discussed the types of respiratory protection that should be considered and stockpiled (6,10) for healthcare workers. However, there has never been a definitive, prospective clinical trial that shows whether respirators are superior to surgical masks. Translational research funding to answer these questions should become a priority.

This report is an attempt to describe the challenges our healthcare system faced when preparing for an influenza pandemic. By no means are all the answers, or even the questions, reported here. Additional work is needed to further identify important questions and appropriate solutions. We hope these concepts will help guide the decisions of other healthcare systems as they work through this challenging task."|"Numerous guidance documents call for stockpiling certain supplies that might be needed to care for influenza patients during a pandemic ( 3 – 6 ).

Bird flu has affected dairy herds in 17 US states from North Carolina to California and has just been reported in cats. So far, it is reluctant to spread among people, although people can both get it and give it to animals.

Between 500 and 1,000 people globally are now dying every week from COVID. This winter, healthcare in much of the developed world has been hit by a combination of flu, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and COVID, leading to rising hospital admissions and deaths. We don’t have real control of any of these diseases.

In the last 60 years there have been four pandemics – a million dead from flu in 1968-69; 774 people dead from Sars-1 in 2002; 7 million dead from COVID since 2021; 280 dead from mpox since 2022.

I’m not sure we are more ready for the next pandemic.

We are not controlling the diseases we can control. There have been cases of polio in children in Gaza and in young adults in New York. This is a disease that was nearly eliminated from the world.

Children are hospitalised with measles every day in wealthy countries. Many are very ill, some are left with brain damage and some die. Measles also came close to extinction but came back as vaccination rates fell.

Cotton Mather (a Puritan cleric) and Lady Mary Wortley Montagu introduced smallpox variolation (an early, crude form of vaccination) to the west in 1721.

The practice attracted controversy because of its danger and the immorality of deliberately infecting people. Anti-vaccination arguments have continued to run ahead of the evidence of benefit ever since. Partly as a result, we have not yet controlled measles or polio.

There are vaccine side-effects, but these are much rarer and much less serious than those from the diseases. Vaccine safety is closely monitored and for good reasons – vaccines are given to people who are not ill.

Other simple measures were described by US Supreme Court justice Samuel Alito in 2020 as “previously unimaginable restrictions on individual liberty”.

There were cases during the peak of the COVID pandemic, where people who wore masks in public were harassed. Lockdowns and other restrictions on mobility were much more intrusive, but there is clear evidence that both worked and people and economies benefited as a result.

Public health measures did control Sars-1, mainly because governments, public health teams and doctors got on top of it very quickly. They used the same approaches that have been used to control other severe outbreaks, including strong restrictions on movement.

Neither mpox nor COVID was controlled. In both cases, global responses were late, underfunded and slow and became the target of political attacks. In the case of mpox, it was initially thought, wrongly, only to affect gay men, and hence of limited significance to others. As a result, not enough was done to halt its spread early in the outbreak.

Many unscrupulous people took advantage of the COVID pandemic, selling useless remedies for the condition, such as bleach, hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin.

There were also campaigns promoting conspiracy theories about the origin of the virus, such as suggesting a deliberate release of an engineered virus, the purposes of the public health measures and the effects of the vaccine.

This made it very hard to deliver serious public health messages and interventions, especially to marginalised groups such as immigrants, poorer people or people with literacy challenges.

Experts are planning for pandemic bird flu, which may happen, but I fear that the next big one will be a virus we have yet to meet. It is critical that we have flexible plans to deal with something besides flu. Unfortunately, a combination of war and toxic politics is reducing our ability to develop and deliver these plans.

To deliver anything effectively, we need to strengthen global public health, including the World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which are both under severe threat to their future funding, as the US shrinks and rearranges its own agencies, and with Argentina’s plans to leave WHO.

Grounds for hope

There are grounds for hope. One remarkable outcome of the COVID pandemic was the vaccines. Most people in public health and vaccine studies thought it would be three years, at best, before a vaccine became available. It will be crucial to maintain the research base and the tools for fairer mass production of new vaccines for whatever happens next.

Two innovative UK studies – Recover and React – also showed a way forward for future pandemics. Recover provided a frame for doing quick drug trials on sick people, including finding that a cheap, safe medicine called dexamethasone worked to treat severe COVID, and provides a model for future clinical care for new infections.

React monitored the spread of the disease and its effects on UK communities. We need to maintain this capacity for smart, focused and timely innovation so we can quickly respond to whatever nature throws at us.

Most of all, we need politicians who will lead by example, giving clear messages about vaccines and other public health measures. We need a global understanding that if I have an infectious disease, that puts you and your family or country at risk. The virus does not care where you were born, what you believe in, or your political views.

In brief, we have the tools, the skills and the people to respond effectively to another pandemic. The outcomes of COVID and mpox were poor. Unless we improve delivery and leadership, we will fail to control the next pandemic too.

If we look at ourselves as a virus sees us, nothing more than tools for making more viruses, perhaps we can learn a bit of humility and get ready, together, for the next one."|"There were cases during the peak of the COVID pandemic, where people who wore masks in public were harassed.

Since then, things have gotten better, with new vaccines, therapies and a greater understanding of how the virus is spread. While COVID is still with us, we now regard it as a manageable disease. But as the current avian flu outbreak reminds us, the risk for a new pandemic is always present. UC Davis Health Chief of Infectious Diseases Stuart Cohen shares what lessons COVID has taught us that will help us better respond next time.

Surveillance and sharing information

As COVID recedes in our collective worries, we in the scientific and medical communities know that there inevitably will be another pandemic someday. According to the Center for Global Development, the annual likelihood of a pandemic is 2–3%, which means a 47–57% probability of another deadly pandemic in the next 25 years. Luckily, COVID taught us some lessons that — if we heed them — will help us deal with the next pandemic.

First, COVID pointed out the importance of early identification and warning systems. In late 2019, people involved in pandemic preparedness knew something was lurking in Asia and were worried. Chances are that the next pandemic will also be a zoonotic disease — that is, something that jumps from animals to humans.

Since I started working in Infectious Diseases in 1981, we’ve seen HIV/AIDS, Ebola, SARS, MERS, the H1N1 flu and now COVID-19, all of which were zoonotic in origin. Except for HIV, they’re all transmitted via the airborne or droplet route, so they spread from person to person more easily.

We need surveillance systems that can identify these species jumps at an early stage and warn people that a potential health threat is coming.

Cooperation between veterinarians and physicians who work in human medicine is extremely important. That’s something we do well at UC Davis. Between our School of Veterinary Medicine and our School of Medicine, we have a highly collaborative, cohesive group working on pandemic preparedness.

Combating the next pandemic will be a team sport. It will take the combined efforts of the medical and science communities and the public to save lives and deal with the pandemic that comes next. — Stuart Cohen, chief of infectious diseases

Developing tests quickly

Second, thanks to COVID, we also know the importance of speedily developing diagnostic tests — and making them quickly and widely available. During the early days of COVID-19, we were behind the eight ball because the test rollout was so slow. Once we got tests into laboratories the turnaround time for a result was slow and we didn’t have enough spare tests to do surveillance to figure out how far the disease had spread. That’s an area that must improve before the next pandemic hits.

This means more and better collaboration between academia and the diagnostics companies. More government funding would also be helpful for development of technology that is easily adaptable to identification of a new pathogen.

Read about how UC Davis developed its own COVID test in 19 days.

Treatment and prevention

Third, we will need to quickly develop treatments and prevention strategies. When AIDS first appeared in the early 1980s, we went almost two years before we knew what caused the disease, another year and a half until there was a diagnostic test, and decades until effective treatments and preventive drugs were developed.

Science is much faster now. With COVID, we saw how the mRNA platforms enabled industry to develop vaccines. Those platforms are adaptable and flexible and will be key in dealing with the next pandemic. Drug development also occurred at an expeditious pace, initially focused on treating the sickest patients but later for those who were not as severely ill but had the risk of progressing.

‘A team sport’

Finally, to fight the next pandemic, we will have to enlist and engage the public. If there’s one thing COVID taught us, it’s that everyone needs to be part of the solution. Misinformation and mistrust made fighting COVID more difficult than it needed to be.

The scientific community definitely made some missteps during COVID. With a new disease, you can’t know everything about it. We in the science world have to be transparent about what we know and what we are still learning. Transparency helps increase scientists’ credibility and keeps people engaged.

Knowledge is power. During the pandemic, I participated in livestreamed public town halls with Olivia Kasirye, the public health officer for Sacramento County. Members of the public got to ask questions — and they were good questions. People came up to me afterward and said they really appreciated the information we brought to them.

Combating the next pandemic will be a team sport. It will take the combined efforts of the medical and science communities and the public to save lives and deal with the pandemic that comes next.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Most of the 80,000 federal workers responsible for researching diseases, inspecting food and administering Medicare and Medicaid under the auspices of the Health and Human Services Department were emailed an offer to leave their job for as much as a $25,000 payment as part of President Donald Trump’s government cuts.

Workers cannot start opting in until Monday and have until 5 p.m. on Friday to submit a response for the so-called voluntary separation offer. The email was sent to staff across the department, which includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, and the National Institutes of Health as well as the Food and Drug Administration, both in Maryland.

The mass email went out to a “broad population of HHS employees,” landing in their inboxes days before agency heads are due to offer plans for shrinking their workforces. HHS is one of the government’s costliest federal agencies, with an annual budget of about $1.7 trillion that is mostly spent on health care coverage for millions of people enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid.

The agency oversees health insurance for roughly half the country through Medicare for older adults and Medicaid for disabled and poor Americans.

There was no immediate comment Sunday from HHS.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump’s health secretary, has hinted at plans at deep cuts to the staff. Last year, he promised to immediately clear out 600 employees at the NIH, the nation’s biomedical research arm. He has not gone that far, but in an interview last month shortly after being sworn in last month, Kennedy said he wanted to remove some workers from the public health agencies.

“I have a list in my head,” Kennedy said of potential firings at the agency. He said some workers “made really bad decisions” on nutrition guidelines.

The Trump administration, with the help of billionaire Elon Musk, has been trying to push out federal workers in an effort to cut costs. In January, most federal employees received a deferred resignation offer that came with eight months of pay. Thousands of probationary employees, too, have been fired across federal agencies, including at HHS.

The latest move to reduce the number of federal health workers comes as the the CDC is assisting with a deadly measles outbreak in West Texas and New Mexico and as lawmakers are debating deep cuts to Medicaid in the federal budget.

Monitoring efforts can either target a specific pathogen or a priority list of pathogens, such as those identified by the World Health Organization R&D Blueprint, or search for new pathogens using untargeted metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing11,27. Each of these strategies can be incorporated into our framework following model adjustment. In this study, we focus on the example of detecting SARS-CoV-2 variants using reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction, with positive samples undergoing whole-genome sequencing to identify specific variants.

We start our analysis by considering a baseline aircraft WWSN with 20 sentinel sites. To achieve sufficient regional coverage, we selected the three busiest international airports from each of the six World Health Organization regions and added two additional sites in South America and Oceania. The locations are shown, by airport markers, in Fig. 1 and are reported in Supplementary Table 6. We show in Supplementary Fig. 14 that selection of less busy airports generally delays disease detection, because larger international hubs offer broader coverage and more frequent flight connections, enabling faster detection.

Fig. 1: Time required to detect a new pathogen with a global surveillance network at airports. a–c, The surveillance network consists of 20 sentinel airports selected for high international passenger volume and geographical diversity (Supplementary Table 6). We use an average \(\mathcal{R}_0\) = 2, at the source, T gen of 4 days and a postinfectious period of 10 days, resulting in a detectable period of ~12.7 days. Detectable individuals have a 16% probability of detection on international flights to sentinels. a, Schematic of the SLDR model and an example of binary detection time series at sentinel airports, using São Paulo as the origin.

Curves show analytical distributions from PGF methodology. c, T fd by the network for outbreaks originating from each subpopulation. The histogram (lower left) compiles results from 3,244 subpopulations. Source data Full size image

The efficiency of the WWSN depends on the pathogen’s intrinsic characteristics, its detectability and the fraction of aircraft tested at sentinel sites. Here we consider a SARS-CoV-2-like respiratory infection with a wastewater detectability period consistent with reported values in the literature6,28,29. We map an individual’s disease history to a susceptible–latent–detectable–recovered (SLDR) compartmental structure, as shown in Fig. 1a. Susceptible (S) individuals can become infected through exposure to infectious individuals. Latent (L) individuals have been exposed but are not yet transmitting the pathogen and remain undetectable in the wastewater. Detectable (D) individuals include both infectious (I) individuals who can transmit the pathogen and postinfectious (P) individuals who no longer infect others but are still detectable through wastewater. Finally, recovered (R) individuals are no longer detectable and cannot be reinfected (Methods and Supplementary Information 1).

Each traveling detectable individual arriving at a sentinel on an international flight is detected with probability p det . The detection rate, p det , combines the fraction of sampled aircraft, the probability an individual uses the lavatory during a flight and the probability that a detectable individual is shedding sufficient virus to lead to a detection. Because current detectability estimates for SARS-CoV-2 in aircraft wastewater vary considerably10,12,19, our analysis varies p det from 4 to 32%. This variation in probability accounts for different estimates of detectability in the wastewater and different fractions of flights tested (Methods includes a detailed discussion). While sampling of individual aircraft independently maximizes detection accuracy, testing combined wastewater at a consolidation point, such as an airport triturator, may be more cost effective. Thus we assume pooled sampling, in which multiple detectable individuals traveling through the same sentinel on the same day result in a single detection, producing binary detection time series as shown in Fig. 1a. It is worth noting that most of these assumptions can be adjusted to accommodate alternative detection schemes, sampling cadences and sentinel site locations.

Baseline WWSN performance

A key metric for evaluating the effectiveness of a WWSN is the time to first detection of an emerging pathogen. This metric measures the number of days from an outbreak onset to the first detection at any sentinel. We simulate an epidemic seeded in one subpopulation with ten latent and ten infectious individuals. The time to first detection depends on the WWSN configuration, outbreak origin, pathogen traits, p det and stochastic variations in travel and detection events.

In Fig. 1b, we show the full probability distribution for the time to first detection for four different origins: Geneva (Switzerland), São Paulo (Brazil), Kotabaru (Indonesia) and Kalemie (Democratic Republic of the Congo). The time to first detection varies widely, from a mean of 14.2 days (90% PI, 4–22) for Geneva to 66.5 days (90% PI, 53–76) for Kalemie, where PI is central prediction interval (5th–95th percentiles). For assessment of WWSN performance globally, we calculate the mean time to first detection, T fd , for each of the >3,200 subpopulations in the model (Fig. 1c). A notable aspect is the important spatial variability of T fd based on the epidemic’s origin. For certain locations in Central Africa, T fd is in the order of 100 days, while for many places in Europe, 15–25 days is more typical. While Fig. 2 shows that detection of epidemics emerging from some continents takes, on average, more time than for others, we also note an important heterogeneity within continents (Extended Data Table 1). For instance, in Africa, the 90% PI of T fd ranges from 23 to 71 days. Zooming in at the level of statistical subregions, as defined by the United Nations geoscheme (Supplementary Fig. 6), we still find broad distributions of T fd for all subregions. Middle Africa, for instance, is very dispersed, with 90% PI ranging from 28.2 to 84.5 days. This result indicates that, across regions and scales, there exist blind spots where detection of epidemics would take much longer if they were the source. Blind spots in the WWSN are partly due to low per-capita travel volume, as shown by the strong inverse correlation between international travel volume and T fd (Supplementary Fig. 8). However, in some cases, detection at sentinel sites relies on importations from secondary outbreak locations with community transmission. This indirect path to reaching a sentinel further increases detection time from specific locations.

Fig. 2: Heterogeneity of T fd within geographical regions. We aggregate T fd obtained from Fig. 1 over continents (South America, n = 297; Africa, n = 338; Asia, n = 867; North America, n = 854; Europe, n = 596; Oceania, n = 292). Boxplots show the median (center line), interquartile range (box), 90% central PI (whiskers, 5th–95th percentile) and outliers outside the interval (black dots). Numerical values for some statistics of T fd are reported in Extended Data Table 1. Source data Full size image

In Figs. 1 and 2, we assume that p det in the WWSN is 16% and is uniform across all 20 sentinels. This probability of detection amounts to sampling from about 50% of international inbound flights, depending on the estimates for lavatory use and detectable shedding in fecal matter (Methods). In Supplementary Fig. 4, we report additional results for p det as low as 4%, thus assuming a fraction of flights sampled in the range 12–25%. The aforementioned heterogeneity of T fd persists across the full range of p det .

While our analysis focuses on T fd for situational awareness, the effectiveness of an outbreak response also depends on both outbreak size and the number of infections already dispersed internationally, along with their potential for cryptic transmission. To address these factors, we provide in Fig. 3 modeling estimates of both the number of infectious individuals at the source and the number of internationally dispersed infections at the time of first detection by the global WWSN (Supplementary Information 3). In Fig. 3a,b, it is evident that a longer T fd is strongly associated with a larger outbreak in the country of origin (Pearson’s r = 0.906, two-sided P = 1.4 × 10−6). It is worth noting that our analysis assumes unmitigated scenarios until detection, although large outbreaks would probably be identified earlier at the source, triggering mitigation policies. Interestingly, the number of international introductions at the time of first detection remains relatively stable, typically within the range of a few dozen infected individuals (Fig. 3c,d). This quantity does not exhibit a statistically significant association with T fd (Pearson’s r = 0.289, two-sided P = 0.277). Regardless of the outbreak’s origin, the WWSN detects the pathogen after a similar number of infections have spread internationally. This suggests that a global WWSN would provide early situational awareness for international public health responses, despite variability in detection time and local outbreak size.

Effects of pathogen characteristics on the WWSN

Although the model is designed to accommodate any specific pathogen and its shedding mechanisms, it is important to note that the natural history of a disease, particularly its key characteristic times and \(\mathcal{R}_0\), considerably impacts T fd . In Fig. 4a, we show how the global distribution of T fd , aggregated over all locations, changes with variation in \(\mathcal{R}_0\), generation time (T gen ) and surveillance p det . A higher \(\mathcal{R}_0\) and shorter T gen lead to shorter T fd , and vice versa; the lower the probability of detection, the longer is T fd , although with limited impact. This can be explained by the exponential growth of epidemics in their early stages. The WWSN will typically start detecting cases when there is a sufficient number of detectable individuals (D) traveling through it; this number is approximately \(D\propto {2}^{{T}_{{\rm{fd}}}/{T}_{2}}\), where T 2 is the doubling time of the epidemic (here measured in days). Adjusting either \(\mathcal{R}_0\) or T gen greatly affects T fd , due to the change in T 2 . Conversely, changes in p det do not similarly impact timing. Indeed, a twofold reduction in p det implies a twofold increase in D before detection. However, this increase in D happens within the span of a single T 2 . The exponential growth also implies that the ratio T fd /T 2 should be approximately constant as T 2 of the epidemic varies. More precisely, as shown in Fig. 4b, the complete invariant quantity reads as

$${T}_{{\rm{fd}}}/{T}_{2}+{\log }_{2}{T}_{2}={\rm{constant}}.$$ (1)

The correction term log 2 T 2 is necessary to account for the stochastic nature of the detection process30 (Supplementary Information 2). In Fig. 4c, we also show how the distributions of T fd collapse onto one another when considering the invariant quantity in equation (1). In practical terms, altering the disease characteristics effectively results in a linear transformation of T fd across all locations (Supplementary Fig. 10). Therefore, focusing on a specific parametrization does not result in any loss of generality of the results, allowing for consistent and generalizable analyses. Other aspects of disease transmission affecting T fd —overdispersion of the secondary infection distribution, length of the detectable period and seasonal change in the air travel network—have a more limited impact (Supplementary Table 4).

Scaling and optimization of WWSNs

Both the number and geographic placement of sentinel airports are critical for optimization of WWSN effectiveness, representing a classic resource-constrained optimization challenge. For systematic assessment of network efficiency, we define more precisely T fd (\(\mathcal{S}\), l) as the mean time to first detection for a WWSN configuration, where \(\mathcal{S}\) denotes the set of sentinel sites and l indicates the subpopulation at the epidemic’s origin. We can then average this metric over multiple origins by weighing each location according to a prior distribution, P(l), for the occurrence of an outbreak, resulting in

$${T}_{{\rm{fd}}}({\mathcal{S}})=\sum _{l}P(l)\,{T}_{{\rm{fd}}}({\mathcal{S}},l).$$ (2)

While T fd (\(\mathcal{S}\)) is a well-defined indicator of performance, its value is sensitive to variation in disease transmission characteristics (equation (1)). To provide a more informative measure of network efficiency, we compare T fd (\(\mathcal{S}\)) with T fd (\(\mathcal{C}\)), where the latter is for a hypothetical complete WWSN \(\mathcal{C}\) that includes all international airports globally. This comparison helps us quantify the relative performance of a specific sentinel configuration \(\mathcal{S}\). We define excess time for the sentinel system \(\mathcal{S}\) using the following formula:

$$E({\mathcal{S}})=100\times \frac{{T}_{{\rm{fd}}}({\mathcal{S}})-{T}_{{\rm{fd}}}({\mathcal{C}})}{{T}_{{\rm{fd}}}({\mathcal{C}})}.$$ (3)

This metric represents the additional percentage of time required for the system \(\mathcal{S}\) to achieve its first detection compared with the complete network.

We use three different strategies to define the geographic distribution of the sentinel network: (1) ranking of airports based on their international inbound passenger volume11; (2) ranking airports by their entropy in traffic flows—a measure of diversity that favors airports offering wide geographical connectivity; and (3) using a greedy optimization strategy that minimizes T fd (Methods). We acknowledge here that a wide range of approaches and alternative optimization strategies for network surveillance can be explored31,32,33. However, evaluation of these algorithms is beyond the scope of this manuscript and is left for future case-specific studies. In Fig. 5a we show excess time for the three different strategies considered, assuming a homogeneous prior for the source of an epidemic, irrespective of the area or population size (that is, P(l) = constant for all l). While the greedy approach systematically provides the lowest excess time, all three strategies show similar performance despite different network configurations (Supplementary Table 6). The radar chart also shows that the greedy strategy achieves relatively balanced geographical surveillance compared with the complete WWSN. Most notably, optimization analysis yields diminishing returns as the number of sentinels increases. A network of 20 sentinels detects outbreaks only ~20% more slowly than a system with thousands of airports, and doubling this number improves detection time by less than 10%. This result indicates a highly cost-effective trade-off between the efficiency of the WWSN and the resources allocated to it. A small number of sentinels provides near optimal efficiency.

Fig. 5: Scaling and optimization of a global surveillance network at airports. a–c, Using the same disease parameters as in Fig. 1, we evaluate T fd and compute excess time relative to the complete WWSN, varying the number of sentinel airports and selection strategies. a, Global optimization assumes that all subpopulations are equally probable epidemic origins, with the star indicating the baseline network’s excess time. b, Targeted optimization minimizes excess time for epidemics originating in Africa. a,b, Radar charts show excess time by continent for global and targeted greedy strategies. A balanced strategy minimizes excess time across all regions, while lower excess times for a specific region reflect targeted optimization. c, Spatial distribution of the first 20 sentinels under global and targeted optimization strategies.

Some diseases are endemic in only certain parts of the world, or have clear seasonal patterns; besides, we have shown that T fd is higher for some geographical areas than others (Fig. 2). For these reasons, the WWSN can be adapted by biasing the optimization procedure to improve detection capabilities for specific geographical areas. The greedy optimization approach allows for this by adjusting the prior function P(l). For instance, to minimize T fd for outbreaks originating in Africa, we can set P(l) = constant if l is in Africa and P(l) = 0 otherwise. Figure 5b compares excess time between conventional global greedy optimization and our targeted greedy optimization strategy. The radar chart highlights the bias introduced by targeted optimization, with coverage favoring Africa at the expense of other regions. Figure 5c shows how sentinel geographical placement shifts substantially when optimization focuses on a specific area. Targeting Africa leads to a higher concentration of sentinels in Africa and Europe, reflecting traffic flow patterns. European hubs are selected due to their high international travel volume, including traffic from many African countries. For example, Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport emerges as the second-top sentinel when optimization is targeting the African continent (Supplementary Table 6). Sentinel selection, however, depends on the specific disease considered and regional characteristics, requiring case-by-case optimization. These findings pave the way for dynamic adaptation of the WWSN to evolving epidemic knowledge and geographic spread.

Situational awareness with WWSNs

WWSNs can be used to provide evolving situational awareness on emerging infectious disease threats. To illustrate the potential use of WWSNs in gathering epidemiological information, we explore the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant (B.1.1.7) in Fall 2020 (Supplementary Information 4)34,35,36. More precisely, we consider a hypothetical scenario where the baseline WWSN illustrated in Fig. 1 is assumed to be operational. The study uses air travel data from September to November 2020, and in Fig. 6a we present probable distributions for the date of first detection of the Alpha variant. Our findings show that, even with 4% p det , the Alpha variant would probably have been detected by November, with a median detection date of 13 November and 90% PI from 15 October to 1 December. At 16% p det , the first detections are projected by late October, with a median date of 29 October and 90% PI from 2 October to 16 November. Because the Alpha variant was first reported by the UK government on 14 December 2020 (ref. 37), these results show the potential of a global WWSN as an effective early warning system.

Fig. 6: WWSN as an early warning system with inferential capabilities. a–c, We simulate a counterfactual scenario of the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant with a global WWSN in place, using the baseline surveillance system from Fig. 1. The wild strain (effective reproduction number \({{\mathcal{R}}}_{{\rm{eff}}}^{{\rm{ws}}}=1.1\)) and Alpha variant (\({{\mathcal{R}}}_{{\rm{eff}}}^{{\rm{alpha}}}=1.7\), 55% increase in transmissibility) are modeled with a T gen of 6.5 days and postinfectious period of 10 days.

Holy water from an Ethiopian well famed for its 'healing properties' almost started a cholera outbreak in Europe. At least seven people were struck down by the diarrhoea-inducing disease after religious tourists brought the water back to the UK and Germany.

The contaminated water was taken from the Bermel Giorgis well in Ethiopia's Quara district. The spring's website says the water offers ""profound spiritual revelations"", ""healing and peace for body and mind"" and a chance to ""witness the miraculous power of the holy water first hand"" – which the tourists surely did.

The US Defense Department’s intelligence agency believed the virus could have been engineered in a lab in Wuhan, China - and caused the pandemic that has killed seven million people so far.

Scientists at the Defense Intelligence Agency concluded the Wuhan Institute of Virology was highly skilled at genetic manipulation, according to analysis obtained by US Right to Know.

And they said the unique make-up of Covid was ""consistent with the hypothesis"" that it was ""a lab-engineered virus"" that ""escaped"".

The 46-page presentation - dated June 25, 2020 and marked ""secret"" - concluded that the virus could have come from ""a large bank"" of bat coronaviruses at the US-funded Wuhan lab.

For years, Shi Zhengli - the lead scientist at the Wuhan lab dubbed ""Batwoman"" - manipulated viruses to make them more infectious in humans, experts claim.

Her lab has been at the centre of the storm since Covid emerged just miles from the facility.

Just weeks before Covid emerged, their ""bank"" of more than 20,000 viruses was mysteriously taken offline.

Many believe it could hold key clues about the origins.

So far, the CIA, FBI and the US Department of Energy have all backed a lab leak as the most likely explanation - with many pointing the finger at the Wuhan lab.

The Sun also revealed how military chiefs were repeatedly told that Covid was a lab leak at the start of the pandemic.

But the new document from the Defense Intelligence Agency is the most detailed analysis released to the public so far that explains the evidence behind the theory.

James Phillips, former Special Adviser to the Prime Minister between April 2020 and September 2022, said: ""This is precisely the conclusion our team came to at the time, but in direct contradiction to the position the UK science establishment strongly took.""

Biosafety expert Dr Richard Ebright claimed: ""All informed parties and persons - without exception - have known for five years.

""This includes those who lied to the public for five years.""

Scientist Steve Massey told US Right to Know that the documents are ""highly significant"".

He said it shows that ""a strong scientific basis supporting a potential lab leak was identified early on"".

The analysis also pointed out that researchers at the Wuhan lab were carrying out experiments at biosafety levels ""which would make an accidental release"" of an infectious bat coronavirus ""more likely"".

They also noted ""Chinese labs have had a history of virus escapes"".

The docs were disclosed through a FOI request for assessments from scientists Robert Greg Cutlip, Jean-Paul Chretien, and John Hardham.

The trio had conducted work for the National Center for Medical Intelligence - which is part of the Defense Intelligence Agency.

The Great Covid Cover-up By Imogen Braddick, Assistant Foreign Editor FEW of us had heard of the Chinese city of Wuhan when the world was first paralysed by Covid-19 five years ago. Today, the sprawling metropolis is synonymous with the ­pandemic that claimed 227,000 lives in the UK — along with its sinister labs where top secret biological experiments are ­carried out. Within the first few days of Britain’s initial lockdown in March 2020, as millions were confined to their homes, questions were already being asked about whether Wuhan’s ­Institute of Virology could be behind the outbreak. Now, as the country marks the five-year anniversary of Covid-19, an exclusive documentary by The Sun reveals the experts, scientists and investigators who not only believe the virus was caused by a lab leak, but that American scientists helped to cover up the scandal. Our documentary took me to the heart of the origins of Covid and explores whether China was trying to cover up the creation of a ­biological weapon by blaming the pandemic on a wet food market 17 miles away. We also reveal that, while scientists publicly insisted the disease came from “natural” sources, behind the scenes they were exchanging messages about a laboratory leak. One expert told us: “Watergate was nothing compared to this. “This is the Chernobyl of biology.” Dr Robert Redfield, the former head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said that a few months before the pandemic, the Wuhan Institute was taken over by the Chinese military while officials deleted its databases and took on a contract for a new ventilation system. We now know that three lab researchers fell ill in November 2019 — a month before the first Covid cases were reported to the World Health Organisation. “I think that’s when the pandemic started,” said Dr Redfield, describing a “frenzied cover-up that was keeping Chinese President Xi Jinping up at night”. The US virologist says he was “aggressively silenced” when he voiced fears Covid had leaked from the lab, where “Batwoman” scientist Shi Zhengli was carrying out experiments on strains of coronavirus.

In August 2023, The Australian reported that scientists from four intel agencies agreed with Chretien and Cutlip’s views.

Yet government officials kept the findings out of the public eye.

It comes after The Sun's documentary The Covid Files: Inside the Wuhan lab-leak scandal lifted the lid on the early days of the pandemic in 2020 that killed millions.

We spoke the experts, scientists and investigators who not only believe the virus was caused by a lab leak - but that American scientists helped to cover up the scandal.

Scientists have repeatedly said that Covid was ""exquisitely matched"", ""completely pre-adapted"" and ""supercharged"" for humans.

And in January, we revealed that Dr Zhengli is still doing ""risky"" virus experiments.

Robert Redfield, the director of America's CDC during the pandemic, said the experiments have ""potentially catastrophic consequences"".

In a paper published in Nature, Shi and a team of scientists boasted they had built the first ""customised"" coronavirus ""receptors"".

In other words, Shi is creating the building blocks to change viruses so that they can infect different species - including humans, Mr Redfield said.

He said: ""Take bird flu - you can modify the receptor so that instead of chickens and turkeys, it can infect humans.

""It's potentially dangerous research. You are taking a non-pathogenic virus and changing it so that it could end up being dangerous to humans.

""You may have a pathogen that is restricted to pigs - but now you could totally change it so that it's highly infectious to other species too.

""She's playing around with bat viruses and modifying their receptor - so now they'll infect cows or chickens, for example. It's ill-advised.

""There's potential catastrophic consequences. It could cause a new pandemic in animals or humans.""

The research will make growing viruses in human cells easier as they have created ""customised"" receptors for viruses.

It means viruses can be more easily adapted to humans, experts said.

Dr Alina Chan, a genetic engineering expert, told The Sun: ""It looks like they have a new suite of engineered host cells to isolate more novel coronaviruses.

""There’s some potential here for risky work to happen downstream.""

Dr Chan, who co-authored Viral on the origins of the pandemic, added: ""In other words, once you have all these novel viruses growing in the lab, what do you do with them?""

Many pieces of the puzzle on the pandemic are yet to be found - and after five years of searching, no natural origin has been discovered.

In 1882, Robert Koch, the physician who discovered the microbe, told a room full of scientists that it caused one in seven of all deaths. In 2023, after a brief hiatus, tuberculosis regained from COVID its status as the world’s deadliest infectious disease—a title it has held for most of what we know of human history.

Some people die of TB when their lungs collapse or fill with fluid. For others, scarring leaves so little healthy lung tissue that breathing becomes impossible. Or the infection spreads to the brain or the spinal column, or they suffer a sudden, uncontrollable hemorrhage. Lack of appetite and extreme abdominal pain can fuel weight loss so severe that it whittles away muscle and bone. This is why TB was widely known as “consumption” until the 20th century—it seemed to be a disease that consumed the very body, shrinking and shriveling it. On a trip to Sierra Leone in 2019, I met a boy named Henry Reider, whose mix of shyness and enthusiasm for connection reminded me of my own son. I thought he was perhaps 9 years old. His doctors later told me that he was in fact 17, his body stunted by a combination of malnutrition and tuberculosis.

The cure for TB—roughly half a year on antibiotics—has existed since the 1950s, and works for most patients. Yet, in the decades since, more than 100 million people have died of tuberculosis because the drugs are not widely available in many parts of the world. The most proximate cause of contemporary tuberculosis deaths is not M. tuberculosis, but Homo sapiens. Now, as the Trump administration decimates foreign-aid programs, the U.S. is both making survival less likely for people with TB and risking the disease becoming far more treatment-resistant. After decades of improvement, we could return to something more like the world before the cure.

Read: The danger of ignoring tuberculosis

Anyone can get tuberculosis—in fact, a quarter of all humans living now, including an estimated 13 million Americans, have been infected with the bacterium, which spreads through coughs, sneezes, and breaths. Most will only ever have a latent form of the infection, in which infection-fighting white blood cells envelop the bacteria so it cannot wreak havoc on the body. But in 5 to 10 percent of infections, the immune system can’t produce enough white blood cells to surround the invader. M. tuberculosis explodes outward, and active disease begins.

Certain triggers make the disease more likely to go from latent to active, including air pollution and an immune system weakened by malnutrition, stress, or diabetes. The disease spreads especially well along the trails that poverty has blazed for it: in crowded living and working conditions such as slums and poorly ventilated factories. Left untreated, most people who develop active TB will die of the disease.

In the early 1980s, physicians and activists in Africa and Asia began sounding the alarm about an explosion of young patients dying within weeks of being infected instead of years. Hours after entering the hospital, they were choking to death on their own blood. In 1985, physicians in Zaire and Zambia noted high rates of active tuberculosis among patients who had the emerging disease now known as HIV/AIDS. TB surged globally, including in the U.S. Deaths skyrocketed. From 1985 to 2005, roughly as many people died of tuberculosis as in World War I, and many of them also had HIV. In 2000, nearly a third of the 2.3 million people who died of tuberculosis were co-infected with HIV.

By the mid-1990s, antiretroviral cocktails made HIV a treatable and survivable disease in rich communities. While a person is taking these medications, their viral levels generally become so low as to be undetectable and untransmittable; if a person with HIV becomes sick with tuberculosis, the drugs increase their odds of survival dramatically. But rich countries largely refused to spend money on HIV and TB meds in low- and middle-income countries. They cited many reasons, including that patients couldn’t be trusted to take their medication on time, and that resources would be better spent on prevention and control. In 2001, the head of the U.S. Agency for International Development had this to say when explaining to Congress why many Africans would not benefit from access to HIV medications: “People do not know what watches and clocks are. They do not use Western means for telling time. They use the sun. These drugs have to be administered during a certain sequence of time during the day and when you say take it at 10:00, people will say, ‘What do you mean by 10:00?’” A 2007 review of 58 studies on patient habits found that Africans were more likely to adhere to HIV treatment regimens than North Americans.

In the mid-2000s, programs such as PEPFAR and the Global Fund finally began distributing antiretroviral therapy to millions of people living with HIV in poor countries. PEPFAR, a U.S.-funded initiative, was especially successful, saving more than 25 million lives and preventing 7 million children from being born with HIV. These projects lowered deaths and infections while also strengthening health-care systems, allowing low-income countries to better respond to diseases as varied as malaria and diabetes. Millions of lives have been saved—and tuberculosis deaths among those living with HIV have declined dramatically in the decades since.

Still, tuberculosis is great at exploiting any advantage that humans hand it. During the coronavirus pandemic, disruptions to supply chains and TB-prevention programs led to an uptick in infections worldwide. Last year, the U.S. logged more cases of tuberculosis than it has in any year since the CDC began keeping count in the 1950s. Two people died. But in some ways, at the beginning of this year, the fight against tuberculosis had never looked more promising. High-quality vaccine candidates were in late-stage trials. In December, the World Health Organization made its first endorsement of a TB diagnostic test, and global health workers readied to deploy it.

Read: America can’t just unpause USAID

Now that progress is on the verge of being erased. Since Donald Trump has taken office, his administration has dismantled USAID, massively eliminating foreign-aid funding and programs. According to The New York Times, hundreds of thousands of sick patients have seen their access to medication and testing suddenly cut off. A memo released by a USAID official earlier this month estimated that cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis will rise by about 30 percent in the next few years, an unprecedented regression in the history of humankind’s fight against the disease. (The official was subsequently placed on administrative leave.) Research on tuberculosis tests and treatments has been terminated. Although the secretary of state and Elon Musk have assured the public that the new administration’s actions have not disrupted the distribution of life-saving medicine, that just isn’t true. A colleague in central Africa sent me a picture of TB drugs that the U.S. has already paid for sitting unused in a warehouse because of stop-work orders. (Neither the State Department nor DOGE employees responded to requests for comment.)

Last year, roughly half of all international donor funding for tuberculosis treatment came from the U.S. Now many programs are disappearing. In a recent survey on the impact of lost funding in 31 countries, one in four organizations providing TB care reported they have shut down entirely. About half have stopped screening for new cases of tuberculosis. The average untreated case of active tuberculosis will spread the infection to 10 to 15 people a year. Without treatment, or even a diagnosis, hundreds of thousands more people will die—and each of those deaths will be needless.

By revoking money from global-health efforts, the U.S. has created the conditions for the health of people around the world to deteriorate, which will give tuberculosis even more opportunities to kill. HIV clinics in many countries have started rationing pills as drug supplies run dangerously low, raising the specter of co-infection. Like HIV, insufficient nutrition weakens the immune system. It is the leading risk factor for tuberculosis. An estimated 1 million children with severe acute malnutrition will lose access to treatment because of the USAID cuts, and refugee camps across the world are slashing already meager food rations.

For billions of people, TB is already a nightmare disease, both because the bacterium is unusually powerful and because world leaders have done a poor job of distributing cures. And yet, to the extent that one hears about TB at all in the rich world, it’s usually in the context of a looming crisis: Given enough time, a strain of tuberculosis may evolve that is resistant to all available antibiotics, a superbug that is perhaps even more aggressive and deadly than previous iterations of the disease.

Read: Resistance to the antibiotic of last resort is silently spreading

The Trump administration’s current policies are making such a future more plausible. Even pausing TB treatment for a couple of weeks can give the bacterium a chance to evolve resistance. The world is ill-prepared to respond to drug-resistant TB, because we have shockingly few treatments for the world’s deadliest infectious disease. Between 1963 and 2012, scientists approved no new drugs to treat tuberculosis. Doing so stopped being profitable once the disease ceased to be a crisis in rich countries. Many strains of tuberculosis are already resistant to the 60-year-old drugs that are still the first line of treatment for nearly all TB patients. If a person is unlucky enough to have drug-resistant TB, the next step is costly testing to determine if their body can withstand harsh, alternative treatments. The United States helped pay for those tests in many countries, which means that now fewer people with drug-resistant TB are being diagnosed or treated. Instead, they are almost certainly getting sicker and spreading the infection.

Drug-resistant TB is harder to cure in individual patients, and so the aid freeze will directly lead to many deaths. But giving the bacteria so many new opportunities to develop drug resistance is also a threat to all of humanity. We now risk the emergence of TB strains that can’t be cured with our existing tools. The millennia-long history of humans’ fight against TB has seen many vicious cycles. I fear we are watching the dawn of another.

March 12 (UPI) -- Health experts say an Australian study linking sexual activity to an infection that 1 in 3 U.S. women contract has provided a new tool to prevent recurrences, as well as find a cure.

In the wake of what's being hailed as a landmark study, experts from around the world told UPI this week that they've gained a key new insight into the nature of bacterial vaginosis, although they also cautioned that finding a cure for all women will require more work.

BV is caused by a disruption in the bacteria present in the vagina. In BV, the ""good"" or ""healthy"" bacteria called lactobacilli are replaced with a group of ""bad"" or ""non-optimal' bacteria, causing symptoms such as discharge and odor.

While most women with BV do not experience complications, it can increase the risk of developing pelvic inflammatory disease, getting a sexually transmitted infection and experiencing pregnancy complications, such as preterm birth.

BV has been treated since the 1980s with oral or vaginal antibiotics. However, half of women experience recurrences within three to six months of completing antibiotics. Women in monogamous relationships with a regular sexual partner are even more likely to get BV again after antibiotics.

Until now, BV was not widely considered to be sexually transmitted, despite evidence that showed a possible connection. But the study published last week found a strong linkage that promises to ""forever change the way BV is treated,"" according to its authors, clinician scientist Catriona Bradshaw and senior research fellow Lenka Vodstrcil, of the Melbourne Sexual Health Center and Monash University.

The study was published Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine. In it, they determined that BV is indeed sexually transmitted and reported that when male partners took oral and topical antimicrobial therapies, those actions -- combined with the usual antibiotic treatment for women -- resulted in significantly lower recurrence rates.

They found a 35% rate of BV recurrence among couples in which both partners were treated, compared with a 63% rate of recurrence among those in a standard-care control group after 12 weeks.

They undertook the effort after earlier studies showed that men may carry bacteria associated with BV in their urethras, and that microbes found in the penis can predict a woman's risk of contracting the condition.

Past trials testing that connection didn't show an increased incidence of cure, which was interpreted as evidence against sexual transmission. However, most of those trials had ""substantive limitations,"" Bradshaw and Vodstrci argued, including limited statistical power among other drawbacks.

Their findings, based on 150 couples in monogamous relationships from April 2019 through November 2023, have been hailed as a breakthrough in efforts to find a cure for BV, which have been hampered by an incomplete understanding of its origins and development.

Bradshaw told UPI in emailed comments the study proved for the first time that ""sexual transmission [of BV] is occurring and that reinfection is the dominant driver of recurrence.""

""The fact that concurrent treatment of male partners -- using an oral antibiotic to target urethral BV bacteria and a topical antibiotic cream to target the penile skin BV bacteria -- very significantly reduces BV recurrence for women confirms reinfection of women is occurring.

""This is exactly what we see with STIs like chlamydia. If you don't treat the male partner, women get chlamydia back again,"" she said.

She noted that the women in the trial were ""highly motivated with highly recurrent BV."" Some had strong risk factors for recurrence, such as uncircumcised male partners and an IUD birth control device.

""Recurrence rates in these women are typically 60% to 80%, and this intervention more than halved recurrence rates,"" Bradshaw said.

She added: ""So, does this change the way BV is forever treated? Yes, it does. It is a simple strategy that is highly relevant to women with an ongoing male partner. Will it cure all women? No, but it offers a very significant proportion of these women the prospect of a cure, which they have never had before.""

The trial, Bradshaw added, also is ""a major paradigm shift in knowledge and clinical practice that very importantly helps us get far closer to curing all women, as it identifies a group of women who may be experiencing BV persistence due to female factors, such as an IUD.""

Reaction from women's health experts and researchers contacted by UPI was uniformly positive, although many cited the need for continuing study.

Rebecca Brotman, an epidemiology and public health professor and researcher at the University of Maryland's Center for Advanced Microbiome Research & Innovation, said the Australian trial showed that ""If you have BV and are in a heterosexual, monogamous relationship ... you are more likely to achieve a cure and prevent recurrence if both you and your partner receive simultaneous treatment.""

While it marks ""a significant advancement in BV treatment, further research is necessary to confirm the findings across diverse populations and for a longer duration of follow-up,"" Brotman added.

""The trial proved a significant reduction in BV recurrences with male partner treatment, but 35% still recurred in the partner-treatment group. I hope this trial paves the way for future studies to further explore the underlying causes, prevention strategies and improved treatment options for BV,"" she said.

Brotman also warned that classifying BV as a sexually transmitted infection needs to be approached carefully, ""as it could unintentionally reinforce stigma associated with sexual activity and BV. Further research is needed to clarify these relationships and their implications for prevention.""

Dr. Kameelah Phillips, an obstetrician-gynecologist and founder of Calla Women's Health in New York City, said the study ""reinforces what many of us -- both doctors and patients -- have long suspected: Sexual intercourse in heterosexual couples is a significant risk factor for recurrent BV, and treating both partners in monogamous relationships may be an important consideration.""

While it represents ""an exciting step forward in women's health,"" Phillips said it's important to acknowledge ""the study's limitations. With a sample size of only 150 couples, these findings will need validation in larger and more diverse populations before they can influence clinical guidelines.

""Still, for the millions of women who struggle with recurrent BV, this research highlights the need for fresh, innovative approaches to treatment,"" she said. ""They deserve more than temporary fixes -- they deserve solutions that truly address the root of the problem.""

Dr. Caroline Mitchell, director of the Vulvovaginal Disorders Program at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, told UPI the latest findings ""offer us another, important tool for helping prevent recurrence of BV in some patients. Since treatment options in the field haven't substantively changed since 1982, this is a huge win for women.""

In her practice, Mitchell said, she see patients for whom BV ""seems very sexually facilitated,"" but for others it is not the case at all, ""so I don't think this is universal. BV isn't like chlamydia. There isn't always that direct connection -- especially for recurrent BV.

""However, BV does seem to be sexually facilitated -- and the results of this study suggest that microbes on the penis likely play a role in at least some cases,"" she added.

""For people with highly recurrent BV, I do think that there may be some passing back and forth of BV-associated bacteria between sexual partners, and that treating both people ... will be necessary to clear those organisms."""|"Women in monogamous relationships with a regular sexual partner are even more likely to get BV again after antibiotics.

Hantavirus, found throughout the world, is spread by contact with rodents or their urine or feces. It does not spread between people. There is no specific treatment or cure, but early medical attention can increase the chance of survival.

An infection can rapidly progress and become life-threatening.

“It really starts like the flu: body aches, feeling poorly overall,” said Dr. Sonja Bartolome of UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. “Early in the illness, you really may not be able to tell the difference between hantavirus and having the flu.”

The virus can cause a severe and sometimes deadly lung infection called hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The agency began tracking the virus after a 1993 outbreak in the Four Corners region — the area where Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah meet.

It was an astute physician with the Indian Health Service who first noticed a pattern of deaths among young patients, said Dr. Michelle Harkins, a pulmonologist with the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center who for years has been studying the disease and helping patients.

“They were healthy, they had no medical problems and they were coming in with a cardiopulmonary arrest,” she said, prompting the CDC’s involvement as experts worked to determine what the patients had in common.

The majority of U.S. cases since then have been in western states, especially the southwest. Between 1993 and 2022, there were 864 reported U.S. cases. New Mexico had the highest number over that time, at 122, followed by Colorado at 119.

There were seven cases confirmed in 2023 and another seven in 2024, according to the New Mexico Department of Health. As for deaths, the state has reported 52 between 1975 and 2023.

The CDC has offered to test samples involved in Arakawa’s case to learn more about the strain of virus that infected her and to perform pathology testing.

Symptoms start one to eight weeks after exposure and initially can include fatigue, fever and muscle aches, according to the CDC. As the disease progresses, symptoms can include coughing, shortness of breath and tightness in the chest as the lungs fill with fluid. About a third of people who develop respiratory symptoms from the disease can die, the CDC says.

Despite years of research, Harkins said many questions have yet to be answered, including why it can be mild for some people and very severe for others and how antibodies are developed. She and other researchers have been following patients over long periods of time in hopes of finding a treatment.

“A lot of mysteries,” she said, noting that what researchers do know is that mouse exposure is a key.

The best way to avoid the germ is to minimize contact with rodents and their droppings. Use protective gloves and a bleach solution for cleaning up rodent droppings. Public health experts caution against sweeping or vacuuming which can cause virus to get into the air.

The hemorrhagic disease, known for its horrific symptoms like bleeding from the eyes, has already been flagged by health chiefs as a ""priority pathogen"" with pandemic potential.

The victim - a boy, according to The New York Times - had been taken to three different hospitals while unwell.

His three siblings were reportedly ill but have recovered, to child’s father said in documents seen by the paper.

The boy’s mother and her newborn infant died of unknown causes in January, it added.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) confirmed the death on Saturday and has since ramped up efforts in surveillance and contact tracing.

Uganda had hoped the outbreak was under control after eight Ebola patients were discharged in February, but this new death raises concerns.

In total, there are now 10 confirmed cases of the disease in the east African country, including two deaths.

The first known fatality, a 32-year-old nurse, was reported in late January.

He experienced fever-like symptoms, sought care at multiple facilities and consulted a traditional healer before dying.

The Ebola strain responsible for the nurse's death and the outbreak is the Sudan strain, while the strain affecting the child has not yet been confirmed.

It is the most contagious but least deadly variant – although it still kills around 50 per cent of those it infects.

With no approved vaccines for the Sudan strain of Ebola, contact tracing is crucial to prevent more infections.

However, since the most recent outbreak, experts have launched a trial of a jab against the variant.

In early February, the first participant received a dose of the vaccine developed by the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, a global non-profit. Since then, thousands more have been vaccinated.

Local health officials were hopeful after successfully treating contacts of the nurse, but the source of the outbreak is still under investigation.

WHO is helping by screening over 20,000 travellers daily at Uganda’s border points.

4 Ebola has already been flagged by health chiefs as a ""priority pathogen"" with pandemic potential.

Ebola spreads through contact with bodily fluids or contaminated materials.

It is a severe, often fatal illness that can cause symptoms like fever, vomiting blood and diarrhoea, and uncontrolled bleeding from various body parts in the later stages.

Uganda has faced multiple outbreaks of Ebola, including one in 2022 that killed 55 people and a previous one in 2000, that killed hundreds.

This latest outbreak is part of a broader trend of viral hemorrhagic fevers in East Africa, with Tanzania and Rwanda also reporting Marburg outbreaks recently.

What is Ebola? Ebola is a virus transmitted through direct contact with blood and body fluids and objects that have been contaminated by someone with Ebola. It also spreads through contact with sick or dead wild animals. It can take symptoms two to 21 days to appear following infection - this is known as an incubation period. Ebola first manifests as a high fever, intense muscle and joint pain, headaches and a sore throat. Initial symptoms are often followed by vomiting and diarrhoea, rashes on the skin, kidney and liver failure, and sometimes internal and external bleeding. People who survive the virus can suffer from arthritis as well as vision and hearing problems. Some types of Ebola can be prevented with vaccines and treated with medicines.

Ebola was discovered in 1976 in simultaneous outbreaks in South Sudan and Congo, where it occurred in a village near the Ebola River, after which the disease is named.

The disease is among several other on the WHO's watch list along with dengue and the bubonic plague of pathogens that could trigger the next pandemic.

The list was put together by 200 scientists from more than 50 countries after reviewing a shortlist of 1,600 bacterium and viruses.

Those marked as having 'pandemic potential' were easy to catch and potentially deadly in humans.

Scientists say urban sprawl and deforestation are driving up risky wildlife encounters, while global travel is giving diseases a free pass to spread across the globe.

There is also concern that climate change could be making parts of the world more suitable for disease-spreading critters to thrive."|"A FOUR-YEAR-OLD child has died of Ebola in Uganda, marking the second fatality in the ongoing outbreak declared on January 30.

Federal health officials notified members of the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee of the cancellation in an email Wednesday afternoon, said committee member Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.

The email, Offit said, offered no explanation for the scrapped meeting.

A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the FDA, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The cancellation comes as the United States is in the midst of a particularly severe flu season. So far, 86 children and 19,000 adults have died this season, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

“I’m quite shocked,” Norman Baylor, a former director of the FDA’s Office of Vaccine Research and Review, said in an email. “As you know, the VRBPAC is critical for making the decision on strain selection for the next influenza vaccine season.”

The FDA typically convenes the meeting every spring to get recommendations on which strains should be included in the upcoming flu vaccine.

The meetings are important because the flu virus changes year to year, and the vaccine must be updated to provide the best protection. Deciding on the strains in the spring gives vaccine manufacturers enough time to produce the shots to be ready for the fall.

For the 2024-25 flu season, drugmakers supplied the United States with an estimated 148 million doses of flu shots, according to the CDC. It’s unclear what the canceled meeting will mean for people in the United States who want to get a flu vaccine next season.

On Friday, a World Health Organization advisory committee is scheduled to meet on which strains should be included in the next flu vaccines in the Northern Hemisphere. That meeting typically influences the FDA’s strain selection.

In January, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to begin the process of withdrawing the United States from the WHO. Federal health officials were later ordered to stop communicating with the WHO.

Stat News reported Monday that officials from both the FDA and the CDC would participate virtually in the WHO meeting, however.

The canceled FDA advisory meeting comes just days after a CDC vaccine advisory committee meeting was abruptly postponed.

That meeting included a presentation and vote on a number of vaccines, including the use of the British drugmaker GSK’s meningococcal vaccine, as well as for a new chikungunya vaccine and the recently approved at-home nasal spray for influenza.

The canceled meeting in March is likely to add to concerns among scientists that HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr, an anti-vaccine activist, could undermine the vaccine regulatory process in the United States, possibly leading to a resurgence of preventable diseases.

Lawrence Gostin, director of the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University, said it is a “clearly emerging pattern to undermine, even eliminate, scientific advisory committees at HHS.”

“I fear that Secretary Kennedy is implementing his long-held skepticism of science and scientific evidence,” Gostin said.

Earlier Wednesday, Texas health officials reported that an unvaccinated child in the state died from the measles, the first death from the virus in a decade. An outbreak in the state has led to at least 124 cases, mostly in children.

“It’s a bad day for infectious diseases,” said Dr. Ofer Levy, director of the precision vaccines program at Boston Children’s Hospital, who has advised the FDA on vaccines."|"A Food and Drug Administration vaccine advisory committee meeting scheduled for March to select the strains to be included in next season’s flu shot has been canceled, a panel member said Wednesday.

A group of researchers last week released a small, preliminary paper theorizing that Covid-19 vaccines may be linked in rare cases to a constellation of lingering symptoms not dissimilar to those associated with long Covid.

They intended for their work to be the subject of academic discussion and to spur further study of what they dubbed “post-vaccination syndrome.” Instead, it has exploded online — and become a parable for the ways in which the internet is being used to weaponize basic vaccine research vital to advancing scientific knowledge about the safe use of these key products.

The study was released last Tuesday on medRxiv, a so-called preprint server where unpublished studies can be shared before they go through peer review, the process by which other scientists kick the tires, effectively, to help journals decide whether or not submitted research deserves to be published. The senior authors of the paper, immunologist Akiko Iwasaki and cardiologist Harlan Krumholz, both serious scientists, were clear in the press release they issued and interviews with STAT that these are preliminary findings that need much more study.

They both also insisted that they felt a responsibility to their patients to share what they are seeing, in the hopes it would prompt other researchers to investigate, figure out how to make safer Covid vaccines if there truly is a link, and, hopefully, find ways to help people affected by any such condition.

“I just saw people suffering and thought we should follow the science,” said Krumholz, founder of the Yale School of Medicine’s Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation. He stressed he continues to get Covid booster shots, and doesn’t think people should “overindex” what he, Iwasaki, and their co-authors are reporting.

“I don’t think it’s ready to be used in clinical decision-making. So, if anything, I’m just trying to tell people: This shouldn’t be factoring into your decision right now.”

That is not the message the internet is hearing — or at least the parts of it where people routinely challenge the safety of vaccines. There, news of this paper “is spreading like wildfire,” one critic of the work, Adam Gaffney, an assistant professor of pulmonary and critical care medicine at Harvard Medical School, noted in a critique on the social media platform X.

Elsewhere on X — and beyond — it was held up as proof that millions of people who believe they are suffering lingering illness from Covid infection were actually injured by the vaccine instead. (Many people with long Covid developed the condition before vaccines for the virus were developed.)

Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, and the owner of X, reposted one such claim to his 218.7 million followers. Right-wing influencer Benny Johnson seized on the study as well.

“We tried to warn you. This is completely horrifying,” Johnson said, also on X. “Studies are beginning to prove that the COVID Jab is far worse than COVID — and may in fact be a deadly poison for your immune system. Thousands of people need to go to jail.”

One researcher, whose university — like a number right now — has told its academics to stay out of media coverage of political events, expressed exasperation at the scientists behind the study, asking: “Why on earth would you do this now if this is preliminary?” Post-vaccination syndrome “is a term that RFK will love,” this individual said.

The fact that the broadness of the term could be read to encompass vaccines other than Covid shots, even though the paper only investigated the role Covid shots might be playing in the illness it describes, was also seen by some as a concern.

“The term is a problem, it’s a real problem, especially at this political moment,” said Gaffney, who believes the study has multiple shortcomings. “We’re at a moment right now where the U.S. government is undercutting people’s trust in science and vaccinations probably like never before in history. And to coin this novel syndrome without even proving that it’s caused by the vaccine is very worrisome to me.”

RFK Jr., obviously, is the new secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. The longtime critic of vaccines has earned substantial income for years speaking and publishing about perceived dangers of vaccines, and bringing vaccine injury lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies.

The paper was posted to medRxiv during Kennedy’s first week at the helm of HHS, when there were already signs that policies promoting vaccines would come under attack. A meeting of a key vaccine advisory group long scheduled for this week was postponed, with a new date TBD. There were reports Kennedy is about to fire some or all of the existing members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, giving him a chance to name new members to the committee. As it currently stands, Kennedy would not have openings to fill on ACIP before 2027.

Into the roiling cauldron of unease about the future of U.S. vaccination policy dropped the Yale paper, comparing a range of biomarkers from 42 previously healthy people who are believed to have developed symptoms after getting a Covid shot to 22 still healthy individuals. Though it’s not yet known whether all the people studied are suffering from the same condition, there seemed to be at least a temporal association between getting vaccinated and developing symptoms like exercise intolerance, excessive fatigue, tinnitus, and brain fog, among others.

Most of the people complaining of the symptoms developed them after their first or second Covid shot, though some experienced onset after a third, and in a few cases, a fourth dose of vaccine. There were cases among people who received most of the vaccines used in the U.S. — Pfizer’s, Moderna’s, and a Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which was briefly available but was withdrawn by the company in 2023.

“Oh, no! Really?” groaned an evidently dismayed Iwasaki, when told Musk had amplified a post on X alleging the study proved long Covid is caused by Covid vaccines. “I don’t want anyone to conflate the two different syndromes in one bucket. That is not the message we’re trying to convey.”

The incident is a textbook example of something that plagues vaccine safety researchers: a damned-if-they-do-and-damned-if-they-don’t phenomenon. If researchers see evidence that use of a vaccine might be causing harm, they are ethically required to report it and pursue study of it. But public discussion of so-called signals of possible vaccine side effects are quickly weaponized by anti-vaccine forces.

It is not uncommon for such signals to turn out to be false alarms, disproven by rigorous study. In the first couple of years after the H1N1 flu pandemic of 2009, there appeared to be higher-than-expected rates of miscarriage among pregnant people vaccinated against the new virus, though only among those who had received the shot in back-to-back years. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention funded a study to explore the issue over three flu seasons. The conclusion was that the earlier findings had been a statistical anomaly; there was no increased risk. The resulting study was published in the journal Vaccine.

Some safety signals, however, do prove to be true. The first rotavirus vaccine, to prevent a diarrheal and vomiting disease that afflicts young children, was withdrawn from the market when it was linked to an increased risk of developing intussusception, a serious bowel blockage. And the CDC and its vaccine advisory panel have taken a go-slow approach with RSV vaccines for older adults, because of an apparent increased risk of developing Guillain-Barré syndrome after vaccination. GBS is a neurological condition involving muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis. Most people fully recover, but some sustain permanent nerve damage.

To conceal possible side effects would be morally wrong and could endanger the health of people who take vaccines to prevent illness. Vaccine safety researchers do what Krumholz and Iwasaki did — they follow the science. But in doing so, and in talking about possible links between receipt of a vaccine and negative side effects before an association is found to be real could be perceived as casting aspersions on individual vaccines and vaccines in general.

Edward Belongia, who was the senior author on both the studies exploring whether vaccination with H1N1-containing shots was elevating the risk of miscarriage in pregnant people, said people who research vaccine safety are well aware of the possibility their work could be used to undermine people’s willingness to get vaccinated or to vaccinate their children.

“Absolutely. We know it gets weaponized and it’s very, very hard to fight that,” said Belongia, who is a senior research scientist doing vaccine research and infectious disease epidemiology at the Marshfield Clinic Research Institute in Wisconsin.

“Science is at a disadvantage against them because they can take little bits of information and distort it, twist it, oversimplify it, and for the general public that doesn’t really know much about science or how this works, it sounds concerning,” he said. “[But] there are all sorts of reasons why what we’re seeing … might not be real.”

Alison Buttenheim, a professor of nursing at the University of Pennsylvania who studies vaccine acceptance and hesitancy, said it’s critically important that vaccine researchers follow the leads that emerge, regardless of whether the outcome exonerates or implicates a vaccine.

She finds it reassuring to know this work is being done. But Buttenheim noted that science literacy among Americans is generally not high, and people don’t understand that science is an iterative process. “We live in a world where people are really uncomfortable with the idea that science evolves,” she said.

The increased tendency to release papers as preprints, before they’ve been vetted, is adding to the public relations challenges for vaccine safety research, said Belongia, though he noted that getting information out quickly, so that other researchers could build off new findings, was of critical importance during the Covid pandemic.

Iwasaki said the group grappled with the question of whether to post the paper to medRxiv, or to wait for it to go through peer review.

advertisement

“I think about this every day,” she said. “But we opted to share this data in preprint because first, the publication process usually takes a while, and patients are suffering every day. And we didn’t want to wait until something is published to share this information with the patients … because most of them have been completely ignored.”

Krumholz concurred. “We did debate it a lot,” he said. “In the end, the information about it was getting out by the grapevine and we thought better to preprint it as it was going through peer review. And we have had experience with journals not wanting to publish information about vaccine adverse effects — and we do not know how long it might take to publish it.”

Belongia said there’s no easy answer to the question of what vaccine researchers who find themselves in such situations should do. The work must continue, and the public has a right to be kept abreast of signals and the ultimate findings — transparency is critical to maintaining the public’s faith in vaccines, he said.

Still, that transparency will be used against the field, Belongia admitted. “I don’t know the solution in terms of how to deal with this and maintain public trust in an environment where any sort of measured voice that reflects the uncertainty of what we’re looking at is drowned out by the chorus of misinformation and disinformation.”"|"Helen Branswell covers issues broadly related to infectious diseases, including outbreaks, preparedness, research, and vaccine development.

SALT LAKE CITY — As the popularity of keeping backyard and urban chicken flocks grows, health and agriculture experts warn that bird flu can pose a risk to your feathered friends — and by extension, a small risk to you, as well.

Estimates vary on how many people have backyard chickens. But the number, regardless of who does the count, is significant. In 2023, an American Pet Products Association's pet ownership survey suggested about 13% of households have backyard chickens. That's especially popular among millennials and Gen Z.

Baltimore Magazine put the number at close to 12 million people in the U.S. with backyard chickens.

Health and agriculture officials say there are steps you can take to improve the odds your flock stays healthy.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza has been confirmed throughout the U.S. in recent years, including in some backyard flocks. As the name suggests, the H5N1 bird flu circulating is very contagious.

How bird flu spreads

Many wild birds are infected with bird flu. And that's the most common way that other animals become infected. They encounter, play with or eat infected wild birds.

The Centers for Disease Control and Preventions reports that the incidence of backyard flocks infecting their human owners is pretty rare, but it does happen, usually through direct contact. People handle their birds, then touch their own eyes, nose or mouth, which are the entry points for infection. They can also inhale droplets without touching the birds. The health agency notes that infected birds that can be contagious may look healthy.

People can also become infected from touching contaminated surfaces. By flapping their wings, scratching or shaking their heads, the birds can send droplets that can be inhaled or land on something that can be touched.

The CDC emphasizes that ""no human bird infections have been reported from proper handling of poultry meat or from eating properly cooked poultry or poultry products.""

Flocks that are infected may die suddenly. Or the poultry can have low energy, lack of appetite, purple discoloration, less egg production, ill-formed eggs, nasal discharge or coughing, lack of coordination and diarrhea, per the American Veterinary Medical Association.

Protecting yourself if you have chickens

CDC's guide for backyard flock owners offers a number of suggestions to minimize risk:

Don't touch sick or dead birds, their droppings, litter or water sources that might be contaminated with their bodily fluids without donning personal protective equipment.

Always wear protective equipment around sick or dead birds, including safety goggles, an N95 mask, disposable gloves, disposable and fluid-resistant coveralls and rubber boots. It should be put on and taken off in different clear areas, where possible.

Don't touch your eyes, nose or mouth.

Don't touch your protective gear until you are removing it, then wash your hands in soap and water,

Never wear used personal protective equipment in your home.

When cleaning and disinfecting, don't stir up the bird waste, dust or feathers, which can disperse the virus into the air. When you're done, toss the protective equipment or clean it properly.

You should remove the personal protective equipment in this order: First, clean and disinfect the boots, then take them off. Take off and throw away the coveralls, then do the same with the gloves. Wash your hands with soap and water. Next, take off the goggles, head cover and mask. If the goggles are reusable, disinfect them. Dispose of the mask. Wash hands with soap and water again.

To disinfect the items that are reusable, use disinfectant approved by the Environmental Protection Agency that has label claims it is effective against influenza A viruses. Follow the label instructions.

Wash your clothing in hot water and detergent and dry on high heat. Immediately take a shower. And pay attention to your health for 10 days after you were exposed to potentially infected birds or contaminated materials.

Cats and dogs at risk?

Cats and dogs that are outdoors can also be at some risk if they encounter sick or dead birds. And that includes if they are near your backyard flock. The best prevention is to keep them away from wild birds, poultry and cattle.

According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, signs for them can include fever, lethargy, low appetite, red and inflamed eyes, nasal or eye discharge, difficulty breathing and neurologic signs like tremors or poor coordination.

The association also says not to feed pets raw meat or poultry or raw milk."|"As the name suggests, the H5N1 bird flu circulating is very contagious.

It's a scourge that has afflicted mankind for more than a thousand years. And it's what keeps Adam Ratner up at night: measles.

""It is the most infectious disease that we know by far — much more infectious than flu, much more infectious than COVID or polio or Ebola or anything else that I can think of,"" says Ratner, a pediatric infectious disease physician in New York City.

In his new book, Booster Shots, Ratner makes the case that the control of measles is a test of how good our public health institutions are. And the fact that it is making a comeback is a bad sign.

""When vaccination levels start to fall, we see measles outbreaks first,"" he says. ""And then those are often followed by outbreaks of other vaccine-preventable diseases, things that are a little less contagious than measles,"" he says, adding that ""it's only February and we have already had, you know, small clusters of measles in Texas and Rhode Island and Georgia and a couple of other states.""

Globally, it's estimated that measles killed more than 107,000 children in 2023, mostly unvaccinated or undervaccinated children under the age of 5. Last year, the U.S. had 284 measles cases — the highest number in five years. That comes as kindergarten vaccination rates against measles, mumps and rubella have dropped below the 95% threshold that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says is needed to prevent community outbreaks.

The U.S. hasn't reported a measles death since 2015. ""But I think that with more cases, with larger outbreaks, that may change,"" Ratner says.

Before the measles vaccine was developed in the early 1960s, the disease used to kill hundreds of children each year in the United States. Ratner sees the resurgence of measles as one of the ironic byproducts of the success of vaccination. With vaccine hesitancy on the rise, he says that remembering the lessons of our past with this disease is more urgent than ever.

""Measles thrives on being underestimated,"" he says. ""We tend to forget now, looking back, how bad measles was.""

Ratner says the development of the measles vaccine was just one step in controlling the disease in the U.S. The other was public policy that made vaccination affordable and mandatory. For example, he points to a large measles outbreak in Texarkana in 1970. The metropolitan area straddles Arkansas — which had a school vaccine mandate in place — and Texas, which didn't.

""About 95% of the cases were in the area where there wasn't a vaccine mandate, where kids weren't getting vaccinated in schools. So the political decision that was made about vaccine mandates affected the health of those children,"" he says.

Ratner says he's deeply concerned about the nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as health and human services secretary. Kennedy has campaigned against vaccines for decades and he's expected to be confirmed this week.

""I am very, very worried about the future of not only vaccines, but public health in general in this country and across the world,"" he says.

Ratner makes the case that public policy is critical to public health. He says the most important takeaway from his book is that our public health successes are fragile.

""We live in a society now where child mortality is rare, where diseases like measles are rare, and where when kids are born, you can expect that they will likely grow up happy and healthy,"" he says. ""That is not guaranteed.""

He says it takes political will as well as science to keep the country healthy.

The study published Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention echoes two smaller ones that detected evidence of infection in previously undiagnosed farmworkers. In those studies, several of the infected workers remembered having symptoms of H5N1 bird flu, while none of the veterinarians in the new paper recalled any such symptoms.

The new study is more evidence that the official U.S. tally of confirmed human bird flu infections — 68 in the last year — is likely a significant undercount, said Dr. Gregory Gray, an infectious disease researcher at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston.

“This means that people are being infected, likely due to their occupational exposures, and not developing signs of illness and therefore not seeking medical care,” Gray said. He said it shows that officials cannot fully understand bird flu transmission by only tracking people who go to medical clinics with symptoms.

Study suggests bird flu cases are undercounted

CDC researchers went to an American Association of Bovine Practitioners veterinary conference in September 2024 in Columbus, Ohio. They recruited 150 vets from 46 states to fill out a questionnaire and agree to have their blood drawn. None said they had suffered red eyes or other symptoms associated with bird flu.

Testing found three of the vets, or 2%, had evidence of antibodies to H5N1 infection. All three worked with dairy cattle, as well as other animals. None said they’d worked with a herd that was known to be infected, although one had worked with a flock of infected poultry.

Gray and some colleagues did a study last year of 14 dairy farmworkers and found two, or 14%, had evidence of past infections. Both had experienced symptoms but were never diagnosed.

Another study published last year by the CDC checked 115 dairy workers. The researchers found that eight of them, or 7%, had evidence in their blood of recent infection. Half recalled feeling ill.

The studies were far too small to use as a basis to provide a solid estimate of how many undiagnosed human infections are out there, Gray said. But even just a very small percentage could translate to hundreds or thousands of Americans who were infected while working with animals, he noted.

That’s not necessarily a reason to be alarmed, said Jacqueline Nolting, an Ohio State University researcher who helped CDC with the latest study.

Available studies suggest people who are infected mount antibody responses and may develop natural immunity, which is “good news,” she said.

However, if the virus changes or mutates to start making people very sick, or to start spreading easily from person to person, that would be “a completely different story,” Nolting said.

Experts urge caution around animals

The H5N1 bird flu has been spreading widely among wild birds, poultry, cows and other animals. Its escalating presence in the environment increases the chances people will be exposed, and potentially catch it, officials have said.

Right now the risk to the general public is low, the CDC says. But officials continue to urge people who have contact with sick or dead birds to take precautions, including wearing respiratory and eye protection and gloves when handling poultry.

“No one’s really questioning that the virus has been moving around the country more than has been reported,” said Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory.

He said he expected to see stepped-up information reminding veterinarians across the country to protect themselves with gloves, masks and other equipment to halt infection.

“I know we have deep feelings on these issues, and we may not all agree on everything,” said Mr. Guthrie, a Republican who is in his first term as chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

It was not to be.

Minutes later, a group of protesters in the back of the Capitol Hill hearing room began shouting at lawmakers to “keep your greedy hands off our Medicaid.”

They drowned out the chairman’s calls for order, and Capitol Police officers ultimately removed five people — three in wheelchairs — as the dozens of lawmakers on the panel looked on. (The Capitol Police later said that officers had arrested 26 people for illegally protesting inside a congressional building.)

The disruptions were a raucous kickoff to a meeting that went all evening and was expected to continue well into Wednesday — one committee member estimated it could take as long as 28 hours — as Republicans and Democrats sparred over the plan, a key part of major legislation to enact President Trump’s domestic agenda.

It unfolded as the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee met to consider a $2.5 trillion tax proposal that would extend Mr. Trump’s 2017 tax cuts; temporarily fulfill his campaign pledges not to tax tips or overtime pay; roll back subsidies for clean energy; and create a new type of tax-advantaged investment account for children.

Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee tried unsuccessfully to extend tax credits that have helped people buy insurance on the Obamacare marketplaces. The subsidies are scheduled to expire at the end of the year, and the Congressional Budget Office estimates that more than four million people will lose coverage as a result.

Representative Steven Horsford, Democrat of Nevada, proposed an amendment that would have made the extra funding permanent. He argued that, because Republicans were using an unconventional form of accounting in their effort to make other tax cuts permanent, they should use the same approach to keep insurance premiums affordable.

“You cannot in one breath say it’s OK to provide tax cuts for billionaires and that can be free, and not provide tax relief for working families for health care, for God’s sake,” he said.

A third panel, the House Agriculture Committee, also met Tuesday night and began considering a piece of the bill that would slash nutrition assistance to help raise money for the plan.

But the bulk of the drama on Tuesday was at the Energy and Commerce Committee. During the first hour alone, Republicans giving opening statements were interrupted repeatedly by protesters who accused them of taking health care away from vulnerable people. G.O.P. lawmakers, in turn, accused Democrats of misrepresenting the Medicaid cuts they are proposing to score political points.

Mr. Guthrie labored to keep control over the proceedings, at one point presiding over a shouting match over whether members of his panel were allowed to use the word “lying” in their remarks. (Republicans had been permitted to say that Democrats were lying about the scope of the Medicaid cuts, but Democrats were barred from saying that Mr. Trump was lying about his desire to protect the program. An informal agreement to simply avoid using the word “lie” altogether for the remainder of the session fell apart a few hours later.)

Even some Democratic senators came to take in the spectacle. Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey, Brian Schatz of Hawaii and Tina Smith of Minnesota were on hand.

That was all before lawmakers had debated a single provision of the measure. Eight hours into the hearing, the committee had yet to debate the Medicaid cuts, focusing instead on other changes in environmental and energy policy.

The bill’s proposed reductions in Medicaid coverage and its expansion under the Affordable Care Act have become a flashpoint for Democrats and an area of concern for vulnerable Republicans who are wary of the political consequences of supporting cuts to insurance programs that have become popular with Americans.

Though House Republicans shied away from a huge structural overhaul of Medicaid, their proposal would reduce federal spending by an estimated $912 billion and cause 8.6 million people to become uninsured, according to a partial analysis from the Congressional Budget Office that was circulated by Democrats on the committee. Around $700 billion in cuts would come from changes to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act.

Republicans argued that their proposed cuts would help control rising Medicaid costs by targeting “waste, fraud and abuse” and ensuring the program’s long-term health.

“Medicaid was created to protect health care for Americans who otherwise could not support themselves, but Democrats expanded the program far beyond this core mission,” Mr. Guthrie said.

Their proposal calls for stricter paperwork requirements across the program, makes changes that affect federal funding to states and adds a work requirement to Medicaid that requires poor, childless adults to prove they are working 80 hours every month to stay enrolled.

That provision, which targets an expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, would not kick in until January 2029, after the next presidential election.

During their opening remarks, Democrats on the committee held up matching posters with photographs of constituents they deemed the “faces of Medicaid.” The lawmakers told their stories as a way of humanizing people who rely on the program.

Representative Debbie Dingell of Michigan directly addressed a family who had traveled to Washington in the hearing, who she said needed Medicaid to care for a child with Down syndrome. Representative Marc Veasey of Texas held his phone up to the microphone, inviting a constituent to speak about how Medicaid affected her. Mr. Guthrie ruled that out of order.

Some of the people being highlighted were not at risk of losing coverage under the Republican proposal. And Democrats frequently claimed that the Republican plan would cause 13.7 million Americans to become uninsured, inflating the bill’s effects on coverage by about five million people.

Pointing to these discrepancies, Republican lawmakers accused Democrats of dishonest politicking.

“Not a single person on these posters is going to be affected,” Representative Kat Cammack of Florida said.

“It’s unfortunate that people are so enraged by misinformation,” Representative Gary Palmer, Republican of Alabama, said, referring to a woman who was taken from the room by the police after she shouted that she was H.I.V. positive and that the Medicaid cuts “will kill me.”

As the hearing started, the hallway outside was packed with protesters, many of them wearing shirts or bearing signs that read “Hands Off Medicaid.” Others wore shirts reading “Fight for Planned Parenthood.” The organization is targeted by a provision in the bill that would block Medicaid from funding health providers that also offer abortion services.

“Hopefully, everyone understands that these demonstrations — people feel very strongly,” Representative Frank Pallone Jr., the top Democrat on the committee, said. “Because they know they’re losing their health care.”

During Trump’s first presidency, Khosrowshahi, who immigrated to America from Iran as a child, criticized Trump’s immigration policy and travel ban on Muslim-majority countries. Uber also has a key connection to the Saudi Arabian government, which is one of its investors and holds a seat on the company’s board. In 2019, Khosrowshahi told an interviewer that the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents was a “mistake” that could be forgiven . He then apologized for the comment and said that the “murder was reprehensible and should not be forgotten or excused.” 1 / 11 End of carousel

The event, billed as the first U.S.-Saudi investment summit, featured top executives in banking, finance and other industries, but the heavy presence of the tech sector reflected how deeply the industry has relied on Gulf States to fulfill its ambitions in artificial intelligence. In recent years tech leaders have made pilgrimages to the Middle East to raise money to develop the AI infrastructure that they have staked their futures on building. The relationship is a two-way street: Saudi Arabia is also looking to diversify its economy away from oil, and the deals and partnerships that have emerged from the trip show how the kingdom is using its deep pockets to become a major player in its own right.

Among the spate of deals announced on the trip was a promise from Nvidia that it will sell hundreds of thousands of its newest “Blackwell” chips to Humain, a startup launched by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund. Chip designer Advanced Micro Devices also announced a $10 billion collaboration with Humain. Amazon announced major AWS data centers in the kingdom earlier this year.

The public presence of so many executives is a far cry from 2018, when members of the business elite went so far as to boycott the kingdom’s investment conference — dubbed Davos in the Desert — over the killing of the Saudi journalist and Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Notably, Amazon founder and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos, who supported a high-profile campaign to draw attention to Khashoggi’s death, did not appear to be in attendance at Tuesday’s event.

Trump’s first major international trip of his second term showcases his emerging model of commercial diplomacy, in which business interests —some of them involving his own family and associates — are intertwined with and even equated to U.S. foreign policy goals. Business leaders and companies are cast in roles as policy ambassadors.

Yet the goals of business leaders and the national interest are sometimes at odds. Foreign policy experts have questioned whether the U.S. is offering up access to core strategic technologies, such as valuable AI semiconductor chips, but getting too little in return —and potentially putting national security at risk by creating profound dependance on autocratic countries. And the question of whether helping big companies get “a lot of checks” benefits the nation appears to have receded to the background amid a cutthroat AI arms race with China.

Trump has often been willing to marshal the authority of his administration to helpAmerican companies get access to big foreign coffers to stay competitive, even as some have warned that such an approach could put the U.S. at risk down the line. The president likes to play the role of convener, the most powerful person in a room of powerful people. This week he certainly did so.

Who wasn’t there?

There were some notable absences among the pantheon of tech billionaires who’ve attended Trump events before. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who attended Trump’s inauguration and has spoken about him favorably, was not there, nor was any executive from Meta, according to a guestlist provided by the White House.

Neither Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella nor its president, Brad Smith, who usually handles political meetings, were there. Amazon founder Bezos and Google CEO Sundar Pichai weren’t there, nor was Apple CEO Tim Cook, whose absence Trump noted.

No one was present from U.S. chipmaker Intel, which had been America’s most important chip company until it largely missed the AI boom. It has struggled over the last several years, laying off thousands of employees and replacing its longtime CEO Pat Gelsinger. Still, the company is the only big U.S. chip company that actually makes its own hardware instead of outsourcing it to foreign companies like AMD and Nvidia do."|"“As you know, we have the biggest business leaders in the world here,” he said.

One in five people in the Gaza Strip are facing starvation as the entire territory edges closer to famine, a new United Nations-backed report warns, after nearly three months of Israel’s blockade of critically needed humanitarian aid.

The warning comes as the UN and several NGOs, as well as civilians in Gaza, say the situation has deteriorated since Israel launched its renewed assault on the enclave in March, as residents struggle to access food, medicine and clean water.

The enclave’s entire population is experiencing “high levels of acute food security” and the territory is at “high risk” of famine, the most severe type of hunger crisis, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) said in its latest report Monday.

“Goods indispensable for people’s survival are either depleted or expected to run out in the coming weeks,” the IPC said. Food is running out, and what little is left is being sold at exorbitant prices that few can afford, it said.

Israel imposed a humanitarian blockade on Gaza on March 2, cutting off food, medical supplies, and other aid to the more than 2 million Palestinians who live in the territory. Israel says the blockade, along with the military’s expansion of its bombardment of Gaza, is intended to pressure Hamas to release hostages held in the enclave – but international organizations say it violates international law, with some accusing Israel of using starvation as a weapon of war.

There is a “high risk” that famine will occur between now and the end of September, the IPC report warned, leaving most people in Gaza without access to food, water, shelter, and medicine.

“Only an immediate and sustained cessation of hostilities and the resumption of humanitarian aid delivery can prevent a descent into famine,” the report said.

Under the IPC system – a five-phase scale used to measure the severity of food insecurity – a famine can only be declared if data shows certain thresholds are met. Those conditions are: at least 20% of all households must face an extreme food shortage, 30% or more of children must be acutely malnourished, and at least 2 in every 10,000 people die every day because of outright starvation or the interaction of malnutrition and disease.

The first threshold has already been met, according to the IPC. Nearly 469,500 people – around 22% of the population - will likely experience “catastrophic” food insecurity, the highest phase on the IPC scale, between May and September, the report said.

David Mencer, a spokesperson for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office, said Monday that “famine has never happened” in Gaza, despite IPC warnings, and that if there is hunger in Gaza, it is caused by Hamas depriving civilians of humanitarian aid.

Whilst largely pinning the blame on Hamas for rising hunger levels, US ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee on Friday acknowledged the rapidly deteriorating situation in Gaza, telling CNN: “If there wasn’t a humanitarian crisis, there wouldn’t be an effort to try to deal with it. So, the answer is, obviously yes, there is a humanitarian crisis.”

Since March, Israel’s renewed assault has displaced more than 430,000 people, the report said, disrupting essential services and the distribution of critical supplies.

All 25 bakeries run by the UN’s World Food Programme (WFP) were forced to shutter at the beginning of April due to lack of supplies, and food is running out at most of the 177 hot meal kitchens, according to the IPC report. And food prices are soaring.

Prices for flour have increased 3,000% since February and 55-pound sack of wheat flour can run anywhere between $235 and $520, the report said.

At a Monday press conference, the UN Secretary General’s spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said only “about 260,000 meals have been prepared and delivered across the Gaza Strip” on Monday, which is a 70% reduction since last Wednesday.

According to the spokesperson, the blockade, which has passed 70 days, has depleted UN agencies’ food reserves. “Stocks have run out, bakeries have shut down, community kitchens are closing daily, and people are starving,” he said.

Pregnant women and children among the most at risk

Children and pregnant women are at particularly high risk. Nearly 71,000 cases of acute malnutrition among children under five are expected between April 2025 and March 2026, the report said. And nearly 17,000 pregnant and breastfeeding women will need treatment for acute malnutrition, it said.

During the nineteen months since Israel launched its assault on Gaza in the wake of the October 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel, people have resorted to scavenging for food, eating grass and animal feed, and drinking polluted water. Starving mothers have been unable to produce enough milk to feed their babies and parents have scrambled to keep their children alive, parents and doctors told CNN.

Imran Rajab, a mother living in Gaza city, told CNN earlier this month she was forced to bake bread using flour from a garbage dumpster to feed her six children.

“My kids are vomiting after they eat it. It smells horrible,” Rajab said. “But what else can I do? What will I feed my children if not this?”

Dr. Amjad Al-Muzaini, a gynecologist working in Gaza City, said women in Gaza are forced to choose between feeding their children or caring for their own health. Most often, they sacrifice their own well-being to ensure survival, he said.

While doing cesarean surgeries, women were found to have severely deteriorated intestinal and uterine tissues, Al-Muzaini said, likely the effects of eating poor-quality and mainly canned foods.

The WFP has said recently it is ready to surge enough aid into Gaza to feed the entire population for up to two months. UNRWA, the main UN agency supporting Palestinians, said it has nearly 3,000 trucks filled with aid waiting to cross into Gaza that is currently blocked by Israel.

“Families in Gaza are starving while the food they need is sitting at the border,” the WFP’s Executive Director, Cindy McCain said on X. “But WFP hasn’t been able to get new aid in since 2 March.”

“If we wait for famine to be officially confirmed, it will be TOO LATE,” she said.

Israel launched its war in Gaza following Hamas’ October 2023 attack in which militants killed 1,200 people and took 251 hostage. Since then, Israel’s military campaign has killed almost 53,000 Palestinians. Since Israel resumed its bombardment in March, more than 2,500 Palestinians have been killed, according to figures provided by the Ministry of Health in Gaza."|"CNN —One in five people in the Gaza Strip are facing starvation as the entire territory edges closer to famine, a new United Nations-backed report warns, after nearly three months of Israel’s blockade of critically needed humanitarian aid.

9 hours ago Share Save Gerardo Lissardy BBC News Mundo Share Save

Former Uruguayan President José Mujica, known as ""Pepe"", has died at the age of 89. The ex-guerrilla who governed Uruguay from 2010 to 2015 was known as the world's ""poorest president"" because of his modest lifestyle. Current President Yamandú Orsi announced his predecessor's death on X, writing: ""thank you for everything you gave us and for your deep love for your people."" The politician's cause of death is not known but he had been suffering from oesophageal cancer.

Because of the simple way he lived as president, his criticism of consumerism and the social reforms he promoted - which, among other things, meant Uruguay became the first country to legalise the recreational use of marijuana - Mujica became a well-known political figure in Latin America and beyond. His global popularity is unusual for a president of Uruguay, a country with just 3.4 million inhabitants where his legacy has also generated some controversy. In fact, even though many tended to see Mujica as someone outside the political class, that was not the case. He said his passion for politics, as well as for books and working the land, was passed on to him by his mother, who raised him in a middle-class home in Montevideo, the capital city. As a young man, Mujica was a member of the National Party, one of Uruguay's traditional political forces, which later became the centre-right opposition to his government. In the 1960s, he helped set up the Tupamaros National Liberation Movement (MLN-T), a leftist urban guerrilla group that carried out assaults, kidnappings and executions, although he always maintained that he did not commit any murder. Influenced by the Cuban revolution and international socialism, the MLN-T launched a campaign of clandestine resistance against the Uruguayan government, which at the time was constitutional and democratic, although the left accused it of being increasingly authoritarian. During this period, Mujica was captured four times. On one of those occasions, in 1970, he was shot six times and nearly died.

He escaped from prison twice, on one occasion through a tunnel with 105 other MLN-T prisoners, in one of the largest escapes in Uruguayan prison history. When the Uruguayan military staged a coup in 1973, they included him in a group of ""nine hostages"" who they threatened to kill if the guerrillas continued their attacks. During the more than 14 years he spent in prison during the 1970s and 1980s, he was tortured and spent most of that time in harsh conditions and isolation, until he was freed in 1985 when Uruguay returned to democracy. He used to say that during his time in prison, he experienced madness first hand, suffering from delusions and even talking to ants. The day he was freed was his happiest memory, he says: ""Becoming president was insignificant compared to that.""

From guerrilla to president

A few years after his release, he served as a lawmaker, both in the Chamber of Representatives and in the Senate, the country's lower and upper houses respectively. In 2005, he became minister in the first government of the Frente Amplio, the Uruguayan leftist coalition, before becoming Uruguay's president in 2010. He was 74 years old at the time, and, to the rest of the world, still unknown. His election marked an important moment for the Latin American left, which was already strong on the continent at that time. Mujica became leader alongside other left-wing presidents such as Luis Inácio Lula da Silva in Brazil and Hugo Chávez in Venezuela. However, Mujica governed in his own way, demonstrating pragmatism and audacity on several occasions, political commentators say.

During his administration, amid a fairly favourable international context, the Uruguayan economy grew at an average annual rate of 5.4%, poverty was reduced, and unemployment remained low. Uruguay also drew global attention for the social laws passed by parliament during those years, such as the legalisation of abortion, the recognition of same-sex marriage, and state regulation of the marijuana market. While in office, Mujica rejected moving into the presidential residence (a mansion), as heads of state around the world usually do. Instead, he remained with his wife - politician and former guerrilla Lucía Topolansky - in their modest home on the outskirts of Montevideo, with no domestic help and little security. This combined with the fact that he always dressed casually, that he was often seen driving his light blue 1987 Volkswagen Beetle and gave away a large portion of his salary, led some media outlets to call him ""the world's poorest president"". But Mujica always rejected that title: ""They say I'm the poorest president. No, I'm not,"" he told me in a 2012 interview at his home. ""Poor are those who want more [...] because they're in an endless race."" Despite Mujica preaching austerity, his government did significantly increase public spending, widening the fiscal deficit and leading his opponents to accuse him of waste. Mujica was also criticised for failing to reverse the growing problems in Uruguayan education, despite having promised that education would be a top priority for his administration. However, unlike other leaders in the region, he was never accused of corruption or of undermining his country's democracy. By the end of his administration, Mujica had a high domestic popularity rating (close to 70%) and was elected senator, but also spent part of his time travelling the world after he stepped down as president. ""So what it is that catches the world's attention? That I live with very little, a simple house, that I drive around in an old car? Then this world is crazy because it's surprised by [what is] normal,"" he reflected before leaving office.

“The atmosphere was of great fraternity,” said the Rev. Gabriele Pedicino, head of the Augustinians’ Italian branch. “You really always have to practice and remember that he is now the pope, because he puts you at ease and has this closeness that always impresses me.”

Leo was seen arriving in a black vehicle at around lunchtime at the Augustinianum, the pontifical institute that also serves as the Rome-based residence and headquarters of the Order of St. Augustine. Leo left shortly before 3 p.m.

The ethos of the order, which includes a contemplative spirituality, communal living and service to others, is traced to the fifth-century St. Augustine of Hippo, one of the theological and devotional giants of early Christianity.

The former Rev. Robert Prevost, history’s first American pope, was twice elected superior of the order, serving as general prior from 2001-2013. The order was formed in the 13th century as a community of mendicant friars — dedicated to poverty, service and evangelization and inspired by the saint.

Ever since his May 8 election, Leo has repeatedly emphasized that he’s a “son of St. Augustine” and quoted from the saint.

He visited an Augustinian-run Marian sanctuary south of Rome on Saturday in his first outing as pope, and during his first greeting to the world, Leo wore a pectoral cross given to him by his order that contained relics of St. Augustine.

Leo, the first Augustinian pope, has also kept as his papal coat of arms and motto “In Illo uno unum.” The words were pronounced by St. Augustine in a sermon to explain that “although we Christians are many, in the one Christ we are one.” The emblem on the coast of arms is that of the Augustinian order: a pierced flaming heart and a book, representing the Scriptures.

Pedicino said that he expected Leo to apply Augustine’s teaching about communion and unity in diversity in his new ministry as pope.

“Diversity isn’t a danger or something negative,” he said of Augustine’s teaching. “So I think the pope will work so that inside the church and out, the ‘other’ is increasingly seen not as a danger if different, but as someone to love and who enriches our life and makes it more beautiful.”

MOSCOW and KYIV — Efforts to halt, or perhaps even end, the war in Ukraine hit a new phase this week — when it appears at least someone from Russia and someone else from Ukraine will gather in Turkey for their first direct talks since the early months of the Kremlin's full-scale invasion in 2022.

If that sounds vague it's because it is. At this point, only Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he will be in Turkey on Thursday no matter what, likely with a delegation.

The Russian side could include mid-level diplomats. Or more senior Kremlin envoys. Or President Vladimir Putin.

For all the ""great television"" Trump's possible participation could bring, the American leader has also expressed hope that Europe's deadliest war since World War II — what Trump calls a ""bloodbath"" — will finally end.

Unilateral Russian ""ceasefire""

The latest diplomatic maneuvering began in late April when Putin unilaterally announced a three-day ceasefire to mark World War II Victory Day celebrations in Russia last week.

Both Moscow and Kyiv each accused the other of violating a truce Ukraine had never agreed to — even as it prompted Ukraine, with backing from European leaders (France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Poland) and the United States (it seems), to demand an extended 30-day ceasefire from the Kremlin.

Faced with a ceasefire ultimatum or the prospect of massive new Western sanctions on banking and energy, Putin instead made a counter offer.

In a late-night appearance before journalists over the weekend, Putin proposed direct talks between Kyiv and Moscow in Turkey for this Thursday.

Admittedly, Putin still had to clear it with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

""I want to ask [Erdogan] if he would allow for the opportunity to hold talks in Turkey,"" Putin said. ""I hope he'll confirm his desire to sponsor a search for peace in Ukraine.""

Was it more of what critics say is Russia's foot-dragging aimed at drawing out negotiations while its forces make gains on the Ukrainian battlefield? There are reasons to think so.

Putin insisted Russia would enter into the talks ""with no preconditions"" even as he insisted he sought a lasting peace that addressed ""the root causes of the conflict.""

In Kremlin speak, that has long meant Ukraine's demilitarization and an end to Kyiv's NATO ambitions, among other demands. Preconditions, by any other name.

But the Russian president said Russia was committed to negotiations — and suggested a new ceasefire as a possible outcome.

""Military operations are ongoing, a war is happening, and we are offering to return to negotiations,"" Putin said, adding that Kyiv, not Moscow, had broken off previous talks.

""What could be bad about this?"" the Kremlin leader added. ""Those who truly want peace cannot not support this.""

Trump pushes leaders to meet in person

Trump responded to Putin's suggestion with enthusiasm.

This is a ""potentially great day for Russia and Ukraine!"" he wrote on social media, demanding that Ukraine attend in a subsequent post.

""At least they will be able to determine whether or not a deal is possible, and if it is not, European leaders, and the US, will know where everything stands, and can proceed accordingly,"" Trump wrote. ""Have the meeting, now!""

Ukrainian President Zelenskyy immediately agreed, though only if Putin signed on to a ceasefire first.

Yet, speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Zelenskyy said he planned to be in Turkey on Thursday regardless and positioned himself as a more reliable partner for peace than Putin. He noted Russia had dismissed a 30-day ceasefire proposal brokered by the U.S. in March and violated even its own ceasefires over Easter and last weekend.

""I believe Putin does not want an end to the war and does not want a ceasefire,"" Zelenskyy said.

He said he had spoken to Erdogan and that he and the Turkish president will be waiting for Putin in Turkey's capital, Ankara. Zelenskyy said the two men will fly to Istanbul if Putin insists on meeting there.

""We will do everything to make this meeting happen,"" Zelenskyy said. ""If Putin is truly ready not just in the media but in real life to meet, and then, at the level of leaders, we will do everything to agree on a ceasefire. Because it is with him that I must negotiate a ceasefire. Because he is the only one who decides on it.""

Zelenskyy said Putin started the war and can also end it.

In Moscow, few believed Putin would accept Zelenskyy's challenge. The Kremlin has long pursued a strategy of treating the Ukrainian leader with contempt and less than Putin's equal.

That is until Trump suggested he may show up in Istanbul too.

""I've got so many meetings, but I was thinking about actually flying over there,"" Trump told reporters at the White House Monday. ""Don't underestimate Thursday in Turkey.""

That has raised expectations that Russia's leader could attend.

Amid the apparent new diplomatic opening, the Europeans have placed their sanctions threats on hold.

In turn, theories abound: Had Putin intentionally timed the Istanbul offer with Trump's current trip through the Middle East? Was it by design with Washington or bait to lure the U.S. president? And, most crucially, could Russia and Ukraine agree to a ceasefire or something even more substantial during the talks — in whatever form they take?

In the latest India-Pakistan stand-off, there were no ultimatums, no red buttons. Yet the cycle of military retaliation, veiled signals and swift international mediation quietly evoked the region's most dangerous shadow. The crisis didn't spiral towards nuclear war, but it was a reminder of how quickly tensions here can summon that spectre. Even scientists have modelled how easily things could unravel. A 2019 study by a global team of scientists opened with a nightmare scenario where a terrorist attack on India's parliament in 2025 triggers a nuclear exchange with Pakistan. Six years later, a real-world stand-off - though contained by a US-brokered ceasefire on Saturday - stoked fears of a full-blown conflict. It also revived uneasy memories of how fragile stability in the region can be. As the crisis escalated, Pakistan sent ""dual signals"" - retaliating militarily while announcing a National Command Authority (NCA) meeting, a calculated reminder of its nuclear capability. The NCA oversees control and potential use of the country's nuclear arsenal. Whether this move was symbolic, strategic or a genuine alert, we may never know. It also came just as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio reportedly stepped in to defuse the spiral. President Trump said the US didn't just broker a ceasefire - it averted a ""nuclear conflict"". On Monday, in an address to the nation, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said: ""[There] is no tolerance for nuclear blackmail; India will not be intimidated by nuclear threats. ""Any terrorist safe haven operating under this pretext will face precise and decisive strikes,"" Modi added. India and Pakistan each possess about 170 nuclear weapons, according to the think-tank Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri). As of January 2024, Sipri estimated there were 12,121 nuclear warheads worldwide. Of these, about 9,585 were held in military stockpiles, with 3,904 actively deployed - 60 more than the previous year. The US and Russia together account for more than 8,000 nuclear weapons. The bulk of both India's and Pakistan's deployed arsenals lies in their land-based missile forces, though both are developing nuclear triads capable of delivering warheads by land, air and sea, according to Christopher Clary, a security affairs expert at the University at Albany in the US. ""India likely has a larger air leg (aircraft capable of delivering nuclear weapons) than Pakistan. While we know the least of Pakistan's naval leg, it is reasonable to assess that India's naval leg is more advanced and more capable than Pakistan's sea-based nuclear force,"" he told the BBC. One reason, Mr Clary said, is that Pakistan has invested nowhere near the ""time or money"" that India has in building a nuclear-powered submarine, giving India a ""clear qualitative"" edge in naval nuclear capability. Since testing nuclear weapons in 1998, Pakistan has never formally declared an official nuclear doctrine. India, by contrast, adopted a no-first-use policy following its own 1998 tests. But this stance has shown signs of softening. In 2003, India reserved the right to use nuclear weapons in response to chemical or biological attacks - effectively allowing for first use under certain conditions. Further ambiguity emerged in 2016, when then–defence minister Manohar Parrikar suggested India shouldn't feel ""bound"" by the policy, raising questions about its long-term credibility. (Parrikar clarified that this was his own opinion.)

The absence of a formal doctrine doesn't mean Pakistan lacks one - official statements, interviews and nuclear developments offer clear clues to its operational posture, according to Sadia Tasleem of Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Pakistan's nuclear threshold remains vague, but in 2001, Khalid Kidwai - then head of the Strategic Plans Division of the NCA - outlined four red lines: major territorial loss, destruction of key military assets, economic strangulation or political destabilisation. In 2002, then-president Pervez Musharraf clarified that ""nuclear weapons are aimed solely at India"", and would only be used if ""the very existence of Pakistan as a state"" was at stake. In his memoir, former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wrote that he was jolted awake at night to speak with an unnamed ""Indian counterpart"" who feared Pakistan was preparing to use nuclear weapons during the 2019 stand-off with India. Around the same time, Pakistani media quoted a senior official issuing a stark warning to India: ""I hope you know what the [National Command Authority] means and what it constitutes. I said that we will surprise you. Wait for that surprise… You have chosen a path of war without knowing the consequences for the peace and security of the region."" During the 1999 Kargil War, Pakistan's then-foreign secretary Shamshad Ahmed warned that the country would not ""hesitate to use any weapon"" to defend its territory. Years later, US official Bruce Riedel revealed that intelligence indicated Pakistan was preparing its nuclear arsenal for possible deployment.

But there is scepticism on both sides over such claims. Former Indian high commissioner to Pakistan Ajay Bisaria wrote in his memoir that Pompeo overstated both the risk of nuclear escalation and the US role in calming the conflict in 2019. And during Kargil, Pakistan ""knew the Indian Air Force wouldn't cross into its territory"" - so there was no real trigger for even an implicit nuclear threat, insist Pakistani analysts. ""Strategic signalling reminds the world that any conflict can spiral - and with India and Pakistan, the stakes are higher due to the nuclear overhang. But that doesn't mean either side is actively threatening nuclear use,"" Ejaz Haider, a Lahore-based defence analyst, told the BBC. But nuclear escalation can happen by accident too. ""This could happen by human error, hackers, terrorists, computer failures, bad data from satellites and unstable leaders,"" Prof Alan Robock of Rutgers University, lead author of the landmark 2019 paper by a global team of scientists, told the BBC. In March 2022, India accidentally fired a nuclear-capable cruise missile which travelled 124km (77 miles) into Pakistani territory before crashing, reportedly damaging civilian property. Pakistan said India failed to use the military hotline or issue a public statement for two days. Had this occurred during heightened tensions, the incident could have spiralled into serious conflict, experts say. (Months later, India's government sacked three air force officers for the ""accidental firing of a missile"".) Yet, the danger of nuclear war remains ""relatively small"" between India and Pakistan, according to Mr Clary. ""So long as there is not major ground combat along the border, the dangers of nuclear use remain relatively small and manageable,"" he said. ""In ground combat, the 'use it or lose it' problem is propelled by the possibility that your ground positions will be overrun by the enemy."" ('Use it or lose it' refers to the pressure a nuclear-armed country may feel to launch its weapons before they are destroyed in a first strike by an adversary.)

MELBOURNE, Australia -- The Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization on Tuesday found Russia responsible for shooting down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine with the loss of 298 lives more than a decade ago, in a ruling that raises the prospect of victims’ families being paid compensation.

A Dutch-led international investigation concluded in 2016 that the Amsterdam-to-Kuala Lumpur airliner was shot down on July 17, 2014, from Ukrainian territory held by separatist rebels using a Buk missile system delivered from Russia. Moscow denies any involvement in the MH17 tragedy.

The Netherlands and Australian governments brought the case against Moscow before the Montreal-based global aviation agency in 2022, and on Tuesday welcomed the verdict.

The International Court of Justice wasn't an option, because Russia doesn't recognize The Hague, Netherlands-based court’s jurisdiction.

The council found that Russia had violated the Convention on International Civil Aviation, known as the Chicago Convention, which requires that states “refrain from resorting to the use of weapons against civil aircraft in flight.”

It's the first time that the council, which represents 193 member states, has decided a dispute between governments.

Dutch Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp said that the council would consider the question of reparations within weeks.

“In that context, the Netherlands and Australia are requesting that the ICAO Council order the Russian Federation to enter into negotiations with the Netherlands and Australia, and that the Council facilitate this process,” Veldkamp said in a statement.

“The latter is important in order to ensure that the negotiations are conducted in good faith and according to specific timelines, and that they will yield actual results,” he added.

Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong urged the council to move swiftly to “determine remedies.”

“We call on Russia to finally face up to its responsibility for its horrific act of violence and make reparations for its egregious conduct, as required under international law,” Wong said in a statement.

The Russian Embassy in Australia didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.

Australian National University international law expert Don Rothwell said that the council had yet to publish the reasons for its decisions.

“One of the consequences for this process will be that the council will probably make some recommendations that Russia pay what are called reparations, which is an international term for damages, as a result of its violation of international law,” Rothwell said.

“So we have to wait and see exactly what the council finds on that particular point,” Rothwell added."|"(AP Photo/Vadim Ghirda, File)FILE - A pro-Russian rebel touches the MH17 wreckage at the crash site of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, near the village of Hrabove, eastern Ukraine, on July 22, 2014.

As dozens of Russia-aligned world leaders gathered in Moscow to pay homage to its military, state media spotted one guest standing out from the crowd — the '90s Hollywood action star Steven Seagal.

Between shots of armored vehicles rumbling down the cobbled streets near the Kremlin, Seagal appeared briefly in a close-up during the state media outlet Izvestia's coverage of Russia's Victory Day.

A separate clip of the movie martial artist moving through the crowd on Friday also circulated on social media over the weekend.

The French news agency Agence France-Presse reported from Moscow that Seagal was seen sitting near a Russian nationalist biker gang called the Night Wolves.

Seagal, a longtime friend of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has been vocal about his support for Moscow and gained Russian citizenship in 2016. Russia's foreign ministry made Seagal a special representative in 2018 to promote Russian culture to the US, and he continued to publicly align himself with the Kremlin after it invaded Ukraine.

He wasn't the only US movie personality to attend Friday's parade. Oliver Stone, a three-time Oscar-winning director who's made a four-hour documentary about Putin, was also photographed at the event.

Stone has also often praised Putin, calling him a ""great leader"" in a May 2023 interview with The Guardian. The director was photographed shaking Putin's hand during a reception for foreign leaders on Friday.

Their appearance at the parade marks how Russia sought to elevate the grandeur of this year's event for the 80th anniversary of Nazi Germany's surrender in World War II.

The past two years' Victory Day parades had featured scaled-back processions, largely believed to be because of Russia conserving resources such as tanks and aircraft for the war. A few world leaders — mostly from eastern European and central Asian states — had appeared to watch the event.

On Friday, however, Moscow put on a full show for roughly two dozen leaders, including China's Xi Jinping, in attendance.

Iskander and Yars ballistic missiles, Tornado-S multiple rocket launchers, and modern T-90 main battle tanks wheeled past a raft of cameras on the street, and Su-25 fighter jets roared over central Moscow with colored smoke.

Also featured in the procession for the first time were Russian attack drones, which have become the Kremlin's staple weapons in the war.

The days leading up to the parade, meant to be a demonstration of Russia's strength and confidence in its military, saw Ukraine threatening Moscow with several waves of attempted drone strikes that forced nearby airports to close temporarily.

Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy had warned world leaders earlier that week that they could face risk by attending the Victory Day parade.

""Our position is very simple for all countries travelling to Russia on May 9: We cannot be held responsible for what happens on the territory of the Russian Federation,"" Zelenskyy said.

(AP) — A federal grand jury indicted a Wisconsin judge Tuesday on charges she helped a man in the country illegally evade U.S. immigration authorities looking to arrest him as he appeared before her in a local domestic abuse case.

Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan’s arrest and ensuing indictment has escalated a clash between President Donald Trump’s administration and local authorities over the Republican’s sweeping immigration crackdown. Democrats have accused the Trump administration of trying to make a national example of Dugan to chill judicial opposition to the crackdown.

Prosecutors charged Dugan in April via complaint with concealing an individual to prevent arrest and obstruction. In the federal criminal justice system, prosecutors can initiate charges against a defendant directly by filing a complaint or present evidence to a grand jury and let that body decide whether to issue charges.

A grand jury still reviews charges brought by complaint to determine whether enough probable cause exists to continue the case as a check on prosecutors’ power. If the grand jury determines there’s probable cause, it issues a written statement of the charges known as an indictment. That’s what happened in Dugan’s case.

Dugan faces up to six years in prison if she’s convicted on both counts. Her team of defense attorneys responded to the indictment with a one-sentence statement saying that she maintains her innocence and looks forward to being vindicated in court. She was scheduled to enter a plea on Thursday.

Kenneth Gales, a spokesperson for the U.S. attorney’s office in Milwaukee, declined to comment on the indictment Tuesday evening.

Dugan’s case is similar to one brought during the first Trump administration against a Massachusetts judge, who was accused of helping a man sneak out a courthouse back door to evade a waiting immigration enforcement agent. That case was eventually dismissed.

Prosecutors say Dugan escorted Eduardo Flores-Ruiz and his lawyer out of her courtroom through a back jury door on April 18 after learning that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were in the courthouse seeking his arrest.

According to court documents, Flores-Ruiz illegally reentered the U.S. after being deported in 2013. Online state court records show he was charged with three counts of misdemeanor domestic abuse in Milwaukee County in March. He was in Dugan’s courtroom that morning of April 18 for a hearing.

Court documents suggest Dugan was alerted to the agents’ presence by her clerk, who was informed by an attorney that the agents appeared to be in the hallway. An affidavit says Dugan was visibly angry over the agents’ arrival and called the situation “absurd” before leaving the bench and retreating to her chambers. She and another judge later approached members of the arrest team in the courthouse with what witnesses described as a “confrontational, angry demeanor.”

After a back-and-forth with the agents over the warrant for Flores-Ruiz, Dugan demanded they speak with the chief judge and led them away from the courtroom, according to the affidavit.

She then returned to the courtroom and was heard saying words to the effect of “wait, come with me” and ushered Flores-Ruiz and his attorney out through a back jury door typically used only by deputies, jurors, court staff and in-custody defendants, according to the affidavit. Flores-Ruiz was free on a signature bond in the abuse case at the time, according to online state court records.

Federal agents ultimately captured him outside the courthouse after a foot chase.

The state Supreme Court suspended Dugan from the bench in late April, saying the move was necessary to preserve public confidence in the judiciary.

Omaha and its suburbs have played a unique role in national politics, as the “blue dot” in a conservative state that wields an unusual amount of power in presidential contests. Though Democrats outnumber Republicans in the city limits of Omaha, Stothert kept her seat over three terms by building a broad-based coalition that included the city’s many independent voters. But Ewing’s campaign and Democrats sought to tie her to economic uncertainty and anger about Trump, whom she backed in 2024.

Ewing said Tuesday night that his victory belonged to “every resident of the city of Omaha” and that his campaign had demonstrated that when voters unite around shared values “we can achieve remarkable things.”

“Throughout this campaign, we’ve engaged in honest conversation about the challenges and the opportunities facing us and our city,” Ewing said, noting his focus on the need for affordable housing, living-wage jobs and “equitable economic development that revitalizes all neighborhoods, not just the select few.”

“As your mayor, I am committed to addressing those challenges head-on,” Ewing said. “There are no excuses. We’re going to get it done.”

In her concession speech, Stothert said she was proud of “twelve years of progress, determination and success.”

“I am hopeful that the momentum that we have created will continue,” she said. “We have remained true to our goals from the very beginning of 2013 with great, great success to improve public safety, to manage the city budget and spend your tax dollars wisely, to increase employment and economic development and to improve the taxpayer experience.”

The election was a fresh test of voter attitudes in a politically competitive slice of the country. The seat held by Stothert is technically nonpartisan, but disquiet over Trump’s agenda produced a surge of Democratic energy — reminiscent of the closer-than-expected special elections for Republican-held seats in Florida and a decisive victory for Democrats in the high-stakes Wisconsin Supreme Court race.

Bibb congratulated Ewing for simultaneously flipping a Republican seat and making history: “With over four decades of service to the Omaha community … John brings unmatched experience and deep integrity to City Hall,” said Bibb, who is the mayor of Cleveland. “He has spent his life delivering results, building trust, and fighting for safer streets, better infrastructure, and more opportunities for working families.”

Ewing, who is the Douglas County treasurer and a former Omaha deputy police chief, and Stothert, who made history as the city’s first female mayor when she was elected in 2013, focused primarily on local issues such as business development, police hiring, affordable housing and the revitalization of the city’s urban core.

But Ewing ran ads critical of Stothert for backing Trump in 2024. The Republican mayor, in turn, aired ads suggesting Ewing “stands with radicals” on the issue of “boys in girls’ bathrooms and sports” — leading his campaign to demand a retraction.

Omaha and its suburbs are likely to be one of the most closely contested battlegrounds in the race for control of the U.S. House next year, when moderate Republican Rep. Don Bacon, a skilled retail politician who has narrowly held his district, is up for reelection. (He has said he will decide this summer whether to run again.)

Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District has long been a unique battleground. For a moment this past fall, when the presidential race between Vice President Kamala Harris and Trump looked nail-bitingly close, the “blue dot” encompassing Omaha and its suburbs could have determined the winner with its one electoral college vote as a tiebreaker.

The district has a high number of college-educated voters and is one of the most urban in the country held by a Republican. Even though the city of Omaha is just one part of the district, Democrats were closely monitoring Tuesday’s results as another key test of whether Trump’s falling poll numbers and the uncertainty surrounding the economy and tariffs would benefit their unpopular party.

In an interview before the election, Ewing said he worked to “capture the momentum of all of the different blue dot groups and get them to be as focused on this election as they are on national elections, reminding them that the local elections actually have more impact on their lives.”

Democrats faced a formidable opponent in Stothert, a former intensive care nurse who raised nearly twice as much money as Ewing, according to recent campaign finance filings. While Democrats have a registration advantage over Republicans within Omaha — 39 percent to 32 percent — more than a quarter of the city’s voters are not registered with either party. The April 1 primary vote was split among five candidates, with Stothert leading Ewing by a narrower margin than expected.

Stothert, whose campaign did not respond to interview requests, cited Trump’s low approval rating as a concern in a recent interview with Tony Bock, the founder of the daily podcast “Omapod.” She said she supported Trump last year because she wanted a more secure border and a better economy.

But, Stothert said in the Omapod interview before the election, “I can honestly say as a Republican, I don’t like everything he’s doing and decisions he’s making. I wish he’d slow down on a lot of these decisions he’s making. I don’t advise the president.”

The mayor’s race also unfolded as Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin, who was elected in early February, was making major investments to help Democrats compete up and down the ballot in red states. The DNC recently increased its monthly investment in the Nebraska Democratic Party and is now spending 20 percent of its budget on state parties.

“There was such a focus in previous years on concentrating resources in Washington, D.C., and then in the eight battleground states — and that was it,” said Nebraska Democratic Party Chair Jane Kleeb, a close ally of Martin who also heads the Association of State Democratic Committees. With the infusion of money state parties can rely on, she said, they will be able “to do the organizing that we need to do to win races.”

Nebraska is one of only two states that divide electoral votes among statewide and congressional district winners. And the 2nd District had been viewed as critically important for Democrats because of the diminished electoral strength of the “blue wall” of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania after the congressional redistricting process in 2020. During the 2024 race, Trump and allies such as Charlie Kirk, the influential conservative head of Turning Point USA, led an intensive pressure campaign to convince Nebraska legislators to change the way the state awards electoral votes.

Republicans’ push to make Nebraska a winner-take-all state was unsuccessful. But the country went mostly red in November as Trump won all the critical swing states. Still, Harris succeeded in winning the blue dot by more than four points. It was one of only three congressional districts in the country that split its ticket between Harris and a House Republican.

Resources from the DNC allowed the Nebraska state party to build on young voters’ connection to Harris in 2024 and focus attention on the mayoral race, Kleeb said. The party paid for text messaging, three rounds of mail, canvassing and digital ads targeting younger voters that cast Stothert as aligned with Trump on issues such as abortion and climate change.

Congratulating Ewing Tuesday night, Martin, the DNC chair, said in statement that “Democrats are overwhelmingly outperforming Republicans in nearly every election held this year — as voters condemn Republicans’ plot to attack Social Security and health care while hiking prices on working families every chance they get.”

“After tonight, vulnerable House Republicans like Don Bacon are on notice,” Martin said. “Voters are sick of cowardly Republicans willing to bend the knee to Trump at their expense. They want true leaders who will govern on behalf of working families and not billionaire donors.”

During the campaign, Stothert touted her record of cutting the property tax rate, partnering with philanthropic efforts to create more affordable housing and increasing police officer pay. She frequently highlighted Omaha’s ranking by Forbes as the best city to move to in 2024 because of its housing costs, low crime rate and strong job market."|"Though Democrats outnumber Republicans in the city limits of Omaha, Stothert kept her seat over three terms by building a broad-based coalition that included the city’s many independent voters.

Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., is requesting that the Department of Defense's Office of Inspector General launch an inquiry on the department's role in ""facilitating and serving as a pass-through"" for the Trump administration to accept a luxury jet donated by the Qatari government to use as Air Force One, ABC News has exclusively learned.

President Donald Trump confirmed on social media this week an ABC News report that his administration was preparing to accept the aircraft, calling it a ""very public and transparent transaction"" with the Defense Department.

In a letter sent on Tuesday, also signed by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Senate Armed Services Committee ranking member Jack Reed, D-R.I., along with six other Senate Democrats, Schiff raised to acting Inspector General Steven Stebbins a number of constitutional, legal and national security concerns related to the possible gift from Qatar.

""Public reports raise the troubling prospect that the Administration involved DOD to (1) launder this impermissible gift, so that the Department could provide cover to give the transfer of the plane the appearance of an official gift; (2) place the onus on DOD to retrofit the plane at considerable cost to U.S. taxpayers; and (3) ultimately transfer it to President Trump's library prior to the end of his term for his continued use in a personal capacity,"" the senators wrote in the letter.

The Democrats asked Stebbins to launch an inquiry into the DOD's involvement with facilitating the potential foreign gift transfer and requested a ""comprehensive audit and investigation"" into any ""fraud, waste, and abuse"" when a potential transfer is completed, given that a mandatory retrofit of the plane would need to occur if it were to be used as Air Force One. They also asserted that the Trump administration is sidestepping constitutionally provided congressional guardrails by accepting the foreign gift.

""DOD risks becoming embroiled in a brazen attempt to evade constitutional limitations on the acceptance of personal gifts from foreign governments without congressional approval,"" they continued in his letter.

The letter also requested, ""in classified form if needed,"" the cost estimate and probable timeline for retrofitting and installing communications and other equipment necessary to meet security and counterintelligence requirements for the Air Force One fleet and any timeline the White House has dictated for this plane to be ready for use by Trump.

They also asked whether necessary modifications can be made within such a time frame to meet Air Force One standards and what possible risks could be associated with that timeline. Additionally, they asked for answers on whether the existing contract for other Air Force One aircraft will continue or be terminated and what the cost of any termination would be.

The final request is whether there would be any counterintelligence and security risks with incorporating this aircraft, provided by a foreign government, into the Air Force One fleet.

""The DoD OIG received the letter this afternoon and we are reviewing it,"" Pentagon Office of Inspector General spokeswoman Mollie Halpern said in a statement.

The primary aircraft used in the current Air Force One fleet include two aging Boeing 747-200 jumbo jets that have been operational since the early 1990s. The Air Force contract with Boeing to replace those aircraft has been riddled with delays and cost overruns, with Boeing's most recent estimated delivery date now slated for 2027.

Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense ranking member Chris Coons, D-Del., and Sens. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., are the other Democrats who signed Schiff's letter.

Earlier on Tuesday, Schumer sent a separate letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi expressing concern about the ""appearance of naked corruption"" posed by Trump's reported plans to accept a jet from the Qatari government. Schumer also said he believes the jet poses a ""grave security risk"" and cited reporting that Bondi personally signed off on the transaction. In light of what Schumer called Bondi's ""central role in approving the proposal,"" he asked Bondi to respond to a number of questions related to the proposed gifted plane.

She was diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer — an aggressive and difficult-to-treat form of the disease — in 2021. She said she had to apply for Medicaid multiple times and wasn’t approved until four months later, which meant she had to pay for multiple screenings while waiting.

Bachman no longer qualifies for Medicaid because she's cancer-free. But she worries that the proposed revisions could make it harder for her or others in similar situations to get covered again, or even cause them to give up on the process altogether.

Bachman is still within five years of her diagnosis, and her doctors tell her that it’s essential for her to continue being monitored in case the cancer returns.

“It’s one of the hardest parts of this journey, besides fighting for your life,” Bachman said of applying for Medicaid. “The application process, the figuring how and when to find coverage, being someone who had no coverage at all.”

As House Republicans on Tuesday haggled over parts of a bill that proposes deep cuts and new restrictions on Medicaid, patients and doctors who rely on the program said they’re bracing for the worst, including overwhelming red tape and administrative hurdles that could prevent many people from getting the care they need.

The legislation, introduced Sunday by the Energy and Commerce Committee, proposes a slew of changes to the health program, such as work requirements, patient co-pays for doctor visits, tougher eligibility checks and citizenship verification. The panel began marking it up Tuesday and hopes to send it to the full House this week, with the goal of passing the entire bill by Memorial Day.

The legislation could lead to 8.6 million people losing Medicaid coverage, according to a preliminary estimate from the Congressional Budget Office. More than 70 million people currently get health coverage through the program.

The changes would make some people ineligible for coverage due to work requirements. Certain groups, such as the disabled, pregnant women and people who are in prison or rehabilitation centers, would be exempt.

Others — particularly those covered under the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion — could be forced to drop out as they face higher fees and additional paperwork to maintain their coverage.

Republicans say they’re fine with the new rules — including Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., who has publicly and repeatedly warned his party not to slash Medicaid benefits.

“Based on the work requirement, anti-fraud provisions — there’s going to be coverage losses associated with that, which I’m OK with,” Hawley told NBC News. Republicans are proposing cutting spending to states that allow immigrants without proof of citizenship to be on Medicaid.

“But for people who are otherwise qualified, who are able bodied and are working and need Medicaid because they cannot otherwise afford health insurance, I just am opposed to cutting these people’s benefits,” he said.

Asked if he worries the red tape could end up removing rightful Medicaid recipients from coverage, Hawley downplayed the prospect saying his priority is “just no benefit cuts.”

The Medicaid provisions are expected to save the government over $715 billion over 10 years, which Republicans intend to use to pay for an extension of President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cuts before they expire at the end of this year.

Democrats argue the added bureaucracy is a feature — not a bug — of the GOP plan.

Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., the ranking member of the Finance Committee that oversees Medicaid, said Republicans want to throw people off the program by putting recipients through “bureaucratic water torture” that many won’t be able to navigate.

“This whole thicket of red tape bureaucracy is being deployed in order to keep people who are eligible from getting covered,” Wyden said in an interview. “It’d be one thing if they had found a pattern of fraud and abuse, and they were trying to root it out. But what they’re doing is they are targeting eligible people who are eligible for Medicaid now.”

“I think it’s really a despicable thing,” he said.

The bill, as it stood before Tuesday’s markup, did leave out some of the more controversial ideas Republican leaders had discussed — including limits on how much Medicaid can spend per person and making states pay more for expanded coverage under the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion, for which the federal government currently pays 90%.

Dr. Adam Gaffney, a critical care physician and assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, said the proposed changes to eligibility, even the possibility of additional paperwork, will cause people to fall through the cracks and lose their coverage.

“You don’t need to be a doctor to realize that this is dangerous,” Gaffney said. “If you’re facing multiple medical problems, the last thing you need to do is try to get through a lot of red tape and jump through hoops and bureaucracy, and that’s exactly what this legislation would do.”

People who want to work may not be able to because of health issues, lack of childcare or limited transportation options.

When people lose coverage, they typically have no other options, Gaffney said. He noted that in the early 2000s, when Tennessee implemented reforms to rein in Medicaid costs, thousands of people lost coverage.

“Most people who lost Medicaid went uninsured,” he said. “The reality is Medicaid covers some of the lowest-income folks in the nation, and when they lose coverage, they’re probably not going to be able to afford it.”

Likewise, in Georgia, following the implementation of Medicaid work requirements in 2023, fewer people chose to enroll, said Robin Rudowitz, director of the program on Medicaid and the uninsured at KFF, a health policy research group.

“Basically reporting and having to document that you’re working, or even if you’re a group that might be exempt from the requirements, sometimes it’s just hard to document that you might be in one of those groups,” she said.

Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., said the new rules are part of a “cruel” and “craven” plot.

“Any added bureaucracy will take people who are justifiably using these services and make it more difficult for them to get on, which will result in loss of coverage — again, for Americans who have sicknesses and illnesses,” Booker said.

Rudowitz said the bill proposes a provision that would require patient co-pays for people with incomes up to 130% to 138% of the federal poverty level— around $35,000 a year for a family of three. There’s also a provision, she said, that would reduce the amount the federal government gives states if they provide coverage for undocumented immigrants.

If the bill clears the House, it goes to the Senate, where some Republicans are eying changes.

Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who sits on the Finance Committee, said Republicans must take a close look at the new Medicaid rules and coverage impacts.

“That’s what we’re going through now. A lot of that has to do with the semi-annual versus annual affirmation, that sort of stuff. We got a lot of mechanics to work out,” said Tillis, who faces re-election next year in a purple state.

Tillis also said he wants to review how many North Carolinians are among the 8.6 million projected to lose coverage. “If you look at that distribution across the country, it probably means sizable numbers in North Carolina,” he said. “This false narrative that we’re going to pick up that bill and pass it as proposed — we got a lot of work to do.”"|"The legislation could lead to 8.6 million people losing Medicaid coverage, according to a preliminary estimate from the Congressional Budget Office.

The Episcopal Church is ending its nearly 40-year refugee resettlement partnership with the U.S. government after refusing a Trump administration request to help resettle white Afrikaners from South Africa.

The church cited its commitment to racial justice as a moral imperative in a letter sent to its members Monday.

Presiding Bishop Sean Rowe explained to NPR's Morning Edition that the administration's request crossed a moral line, and that the church would not help while other refugee programs remain largely frozen by the White House.

""The idea that we would be somehow resettling Afrikaners at this point over other refugees who have been vetted and waiting in camps for months or even years, is unfathomable to us,"" Rowe, the church's youngest presiding bishop ever, said.

President Trump has repeatedly claimed, without evidence, that white South African farmers, known as Afrikaners, are facing genocide and land seizures. The Trump administration classified the white Afrikaners as refugees earlier this year. Speaking to reporters at the White House on Monday, Trump said: ""It's a genocide that's taking place that you people don't want to write about, but it's a terrible thing that's taking place. And farmers are being killed. They happen to be white, but whether they're white or Black makes no difference to me, but white farmers are being brutally killed, and their land is being confiscated in South Africa.""

NPR reported this week that while South Africa passed a land reform law earlier this year allowing, in rare cases, for land expropriation without compensation, no land has been seized. White South Africans make up about 7% of the population yet own around 70% of commercial farmland.

In this interview with NPR's Michel Martin, Rowe reflected on the values that led the church to end its partnership with the current administration.

Interview highlights

Michel Martin: Tell us more about what went into the decision to end the migration ministry.

Sean Rowe: Well, the reality is, we don't feel like we can be ourselves in the Episcopal Church and take the step of resettling white Afrikaners from South Africa. Our church has a commitment to racial justice and reconciliation. We have historic ties with the church in South Africa, particularly the Anglican Church, our sister church there. So we're not able to take this step. And in addition to that, we're sad and really in a shame that many of the refugees who are being denied entrance to the U.S. are people who've worked alongside our military in Iraq and Afghanistan and now face danger at home. We just can't see that having fast tracked Afrikaners in this way is morally just.

Martin: I want to mention that Archbishop Desmond Tutu was part of the Anglican community. He was an Anglican cleric. He was, of course, awarded the Nobel Prize, in part for his leadership in opposing apartheid. Was that heritage, I would call it, part of what motivated the decision of the Episcopal Church?

Rowe: Absolutely, Episcopalians have been partners in that work. We've opposed apartheid from the beginning. Desmond Tutu was a teacher to us, and we were a partner to him. In fact, his young seminarian, I remember driving him around Washington, D.C. during one of his visits. We have strong ties to that country and to that fight against racism and the apartheid regime. And the idea that we would be somehow resettling Afrikaners at this point over other refugees, who have been vetted and waiting in camps for months or even years, is unfathomable to us.

Martin: The president claims that these folks, the Afrikaners, are being subjected to racist harassment. I think he even used the word genocide at one point for the record. You just say that's just not true?

Rowe: Yeah, I don't think the data bears that out. And certainly genocide, that's really a bridge too far.

Martin: Shortly after taking office, President Trump halted, as we said, nearly all refugee entry into the United States. Why do you think he seems to have such deep sympathy for Afrikaners and so little for people from other parts of the world?

Rowe: That's a really good question. I really don't don't understand why this is the way it is, except that it seems to me that some people are more valuable than others. And in this case, it seems to be that people who are white seem to be more valuable than those who are people of color. And in any case, the way that this has happened, the decision making, the criteria that has gone into this just doesn't fit with our morals and the values that we hold as a church.

Martin: So what impact has this refugee pause had on the work that you do? This pause on refugees from everywhere other than these white South Africans?

Rowe: Since 1980 we've settled more than 100,000 refugees and so have our other partner agencies with the government. What has happened since January is that this program has entirely been shut down. So now no refugees, almost no refugees are being coming into the United States, and now, all of a sudden, Afrikaners have been fast tracked over people who have assisted the government, over people who are being persecuted for their religion and for their political stance all around the world, people waiting to be reunified with their families, and now we've got Afrikaners coming in at this point. It just doesn't make any sense.

Sponsor Message

Martin: After your partnership with the U.S. government officially ends in September, what will your work with migrants look like after that?

Rowe: We're gonna pivot our work to work with immigration and migration on the ground. We can't be partners with the federal government at this point, but we will continue our work and our advocacy to the most vulnerable. That's what Jesus calls us to, to care for the poor and the most vulnerable. And we will continue that work."|"Episcopal Church leader says helping Afrikaners over other refugees is 'unfathomable'toggle caption Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty ImagesThe Episcopal Church is ending its nearly 40-year refugee resettlement partnership with the U.S. government after refusing a Trump administration request to help resettle white Afrikaners from South Africa.

The Allegany school system had dismissed most of its schools at 2 p.m. and canceled after-school activities Tuesday after the National Weather Service warned of hazardous, life-threatening flooding conditions. The flood warning will remain until 11:15 p.m. Tuesday, according to the Maryland Department of Emergency Management.

The agency issued flood warnings Tuesday for much of Western Maryland. Flood warnings in Allegany and Garrett Counties remain in place until around midnight, the department wrote on X. As of about 4 p.m., Washington County is under a flood warning while Frederick County is under a flood watch.

Rain associated with an eastern-U. S. storm system moved into the mountains of Western Maryland on Monday night, becoming heavy around sunrise Tuesday. Through early afternoon, heavy rain continued to redevelop over the region, dropping up to an inch of rain per hour.

At least 2 to 4 inches fell in the mountainous terrain with the morning to midday activity. Some spots near Westernport probably picked up more. Rapid runoff of water flowing downhill quickly filled creeks and streams, leading to flooding.

A rare flash flood emergency — issued when life-threatening flooding is ongoing — was hoisted this afternoon there, among several other flood warnings through the day.

Georges Creek, which runs through the town, witnessed swift rises through much of Tuesday. The creek empties into the North Branch of the Potomac River next to Westernport Elementary. Other nearby businesses and residences have also been affected.

At 7 a.m. Tuesday, the water level gauge there was at 4.25 feet, or several feel below flooding. By midafternoon it was at major flood, around 12 feet. The rate of rise has since slowed.

Dayton said the Potomac Fire Company No. 2 was called out to Westernport Elementary after 1:30 p.m. and the rescue operation completed just before 5 p.m.

“Everything was done by boat and motorcraft, so you can only take a few people at a time,” Dayton said. “Everyone, as far as I’m aware, was not necessarily in major danger, they just needed to be moved to a higher location.”

Alley Wade said she was in a full-blown panic trying to get home. Wade, 33, works as a nurse in Oakland, Maryland, which she says is about a 30-minute drive from her home in Westernport. Her two sons, William, 10, and Quinton, 8, attend the elementary school and were stuck inside because of the flooding.

She was already upset because she said neither her nor her husband got an emergency alert from the county. Wade first got a text from her mother, who works in a neighboring county, asking if the boys were getting out of school early. She eventually made it to the school around 2 p.m. and stood on a hill that overlooked an area where children were being evacuated.

“I felt helpless because my kids are stuck in there and the water is rising,” Wade said.

Wade said that she saw William emerge first on a rescue boat about 4 p.m. Quinton soon followed at 4:11 p.m., she said. Officials later told Wade that water was touching the ceiling of the first floor.

Wade said that the school workers kept the children safe and calm. Her kids haven’t said much yet about what happened.

William told Wade the thing he was most concerned about was his close friend’s cat and house, which he passed by on the boat ride, she said.

“Quinton said, ‘Everyone was crying and screaming and panicking and I just didn’t. I loved the boat ride,’ ” Wade said. “I told him, “Well, I did not.' ”

Gov. Wes Moore (D) said on X that “We are closely monitoring the flood conditions that are present across Western Maryland due to heavy rainfall, especially in Allegany County. The State of Maryland and local authorities are engaged in response. We have been in touch with local officials and are standing by to lend more support if necessary.”

Former Maryland governor Larry Hogan (R) said on social media that he and his wife, Yumi, were praying for people in Allegany County Tuesday. “We’re grateful to the first responders, emergency crews, and Maryland State Police for their quick action to evacuate schools and keep residents safe,” he wrote.

Head pastor Dave Cowan of Bruce Outreach Center Church said the church has taken in around 30 people from Allegany County and may take in more people through the night.

Mexican Security Secretary Omar García Harfuch confirmed a report by independent journalist Luis Chaparro that family members of Ovidio Guzman Lopez, who was extradited to the United States in 2023, had entered the U.S.

Guzmán Lopez is one of the brothers left running a faction of the Sinaloa Cartel after notorious capo Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán was imprisoned in the U.S. Video showed the family members walking across the border from Tijuana with their suitcases to waiting U.S. agents.

Rumors had circulated last week that the younger Guzmán would plead guilty to avoid trial for several drug trafficking charges in the U.S. after being extradited in 2023.

García Harfuch confirmed the family members’ crossing in a radio interview and said it was clear to Mexican authorities that they were doing so after negotiations between Guzmán López and the U.S. government.

He believed that was the case because the former cartel boss, whose lawyer said in January he had entered negotiations with U.S. authorities, had been pointing fingers at members of other criminal organizations likely as part of a cooperation agreement.

“It is evident that his family is going to the U.S. because of a negotiation or an offer that the Department of Justice is giving him,” Garcia Harfuch said.

He said that none of the family members were being pursued by Mexican authorities and that the government of U.S. President Donald Trump “has to share information” with Mexican prosecutors, something it has not yet done.

The confirmation by García Harfuch comes the same day that the U.S. Attorney General’s Office announced it was charging a number of top cartel leaders with “narcoterrorism” for the first time since the Trump administration declared a number of cartels as foreign terrorist organizations.

While prosecutors declined to comment on the video of the family, U.S. Attorney Adam Gordon for the Southern District of California and other officials sent a warning to cartel members, repeatedly citing the Sinaloa Cartel by name.

“Let me be direct, to the leaders of the Sinaloa Cartel, you are no longer the hunters, you are the hunted. You will be betrayed by your friends, you will be hounded by your enemies, and you will ultimately find yourself and your face here in a courtroom in the Southern District of California,” Gordon said."|"MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico’s security chief confirmed Tuesday that 17 family members of cartel leaders crossed into the U.S. last week as part of a deal between a son of the former head of the Sinaloa Cartel and the Trump administration.

“His rise is not just a religious milestone, it’s a historical affirmation,” genealogist and former official Louisiana state archivist Alex DaPaul Lee said of the man previously known as Cardinal Robert Prevost.

When Lee first heard about the pope’s Creole roots from fellow genealogist Jamarlon Glenn, he responded, “There’s no way,” Lee said with a laugh. “But then I began going down a rabbit hole of research.”

Lee, the founder of Alex Genealogy and Southwest Louisiana Genealogy Researchers, discovered troves of documents in his collection and gathered records from his network of genealogists that confirmed information about Pope Leo’s background. It also showed generations of Catholicism within Prevost’s family.

“It didn’t take long for me to realize that he was a Creole from the seventh ward of New Orleans, Louisiana, which was a prominent place for Louisiana Creoles,” he said.

The news of the pope’s Creole roots was also noted by genealogist Jari C. Honora. Leo’s brother John Prevost confirmed the connection to The New York Times and said he and his brothers had never talked about it. “It was never an issue,” John Prevost told the Times.

Although his paternal surname, “Prevost,” is common in Louisiana, Lee said a strong Creole connection was actually found in Pope Leo’s maternal ancestry: His great-great-grandmother Celeste Lemelle was the daughter of two free people of color, Louis Lemelle and Celeste Olimpie Grandpres. They married in Opelousas, Louisiana, in 1798, and were legally classified as “quadroons.”

“That meant they would have a fourth African ancestry or it could have been Native American ancestry,” Lee said.

The Creole community emerged in Louisiana due to the blending of cultures there. French, Native American, Spanish, German and descendants of West African countries all cohabitated in the region during the pre-colonial era when France and Spain owned the Louisiana territory.

In Louisiana during the 1700s, there were three main racial categories: the enslaved, Gens de Couleur Libres (free people of color/Creoles of color) and the white planter class, according to Lee.

The classifications within the Creole community were based on legal status and racial identity, with other categories like “mulatto” and “octoroon” often showing up within historic documents, Lee said. He added that there were also Creoles of color who owned enslaved people at the time. Documentation shows that the Lemelle family once owned enslaved people.

Lee said the Lemelle family, which traced its wealth to cattle ranching, became one of the most prominent Creole families during the Antebellum period in Louisiana.

The pope’s great-great-grandmother Celeste Lemelle was a free woman of color and documents show she was given earnings from a business owned by Ferdinand Gayarré in December of 1833. In addition, she was also given land in 1850 from Frédéric Guimont, a merchant whom she had several children with. The transaction was irrevocable as a way to protect her ownership of it, Lee said.

“One of the most significant things about Louisiana was that women could own property and they have been owning property since its early inception, especially free women of color,” Lee said.

Lee pointed out where the change of racial identity can be seen within Pope Leo’s family during the 1800s.

Celeste Lemelle’s son Ferdinand David Baquie, born in New Orleans on Oct. 10, 1837, was listed as “mulatto” in the 1870 census. But in 1880, he and his entire family were listed as white.

In terms of how Pope Leo’s family ended up in Illinois, Lee said his family was likely part of the hundreds of other Louisiana Creoles who migrated north during the first wave of the Great Migration in the early 1900s.

“Illinois was once part of the Louisiana territory. They had an old post by the name of Kaskaskia where they had some of the earliest Creole people,” Lee said, adding that people of color would have had more job opportunities and better civil liberties in the northern state.

“Considering the fact that many of these families passed for white in Chicago meant they were going to have more success, regardless, because of their appearance.”

Lee said it’s notable that the pope’s racial background reflects the diverse blends of cultures that have historically merged to form the unique identity of Louisiana.

“In America, a lot of people think everything is just Black or white,” he said. “But it’s important to note that the pope’s ancestry represents a more inclusive view of what it means to be a Catholic, and what it means to be an American with Louisiana Creole ties. This is more than just genealogy, it’s a legacy.”"|"Alex DaPaul Lee, founder of Alex Genealogy and Southwest Louisiana Genealogy Researchers.

A federal court held the very first hearing on President Donald Trump’s wide-ranging, so-called Liberation Day tariffs on Tuesday, offering the earliest window into whether those tariffs — and potentially all of the shifting tariffs Trump has imposed since he retook office — will be struck down. The case is V.O.S. Selections v. Trump.

It is unclear how the three-judge panel that heard the case will rule, but it appears somewhat more likely than not that they will rule that the tariffs are unlawful. All three of the judges, who sit on the US Court of International Trade, appeared troubled by the Trump administration’s claim that the judiciary may not review the legality of the tariffs at all. But Jeffrey Schwab, the lawyer representing several small businesses challenging the tariffs, also faced an array of skeptical questions.

Many of the judges’ questions focused on United States v. Yoshida International (1975), a federal appeals court decision which upheld a 10 percent tariff President Richard Nixon briefly imposed on nearly all foreign goods.

That is understandable: Yoshida remains binding on the trade court, and the three judges must take it into account when they make their decision. It is not, however, binding upon the Supreme Court, whose justices will be free to ignore Yoshida if they want. Ultimately, that means it is unclear how much influence the trade court’s eventual decision will have over the Supreme Court, which is likely to have the final word on the tariffs.

At the heart of V.O.S. Selections are four key words in the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA), the statute Trump relied on when he imposed these tariffs.

That statute permits the president to “regulate” transactions involving foreign goods — a verb which Yoshida held is expansive enough to permit tariffs — but only “to deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat with respect to which a national emergency has been declared.” It is likely that the trade court’s decision will turn on what the words “unusual and extraordinary threat” means. While Yoshida offered guidance on “regulate,” there appears to be few, if any, precedents interpreting what those four words mean.

In his executive order laying out the rationale for these tariffs, Trump claimed they are needed to combat “large and persistent annual US goods trade deficits” — meaning that the United States buys more goods from many countries than it sells to them. But it’s far from clear how this trade deficit, which has existed for decades, qualifies as either “unusual” or “extraordinary.”

Schwab seemed to flub several direct questions from the judges asking him to come up with a universal rule they could apply to determine which “threats” are “unusual” or “extraordinary.” When Judge Gary Katzmann, an Obama appointee, asked Schwab to name the best case supporting his argument that a trade deficit is neither unusual nor extraordinary, for example, Schwab was unable to do so.

That said, some of the judges sounded outright offended when Eric Hamilton, the lawyer for the Trump administration, claimed that the question of what constitutes an unusual or extraordinary threat is a “political question” — a legal term meaning that the courts aren’t allowed to decide that matter. As Judge Jane Restani, a Reagan appointee, told Hamilton, his argument suggests that there is “no limit” to the president’s power to impose tariffs, even if the president claims that a shortage of peanut butter is a national emergency.

The overall picture presented by the argument is that all three judges (the third is Judge Timothy Reif, a Trump appointee) are troubled by the broad power Trump claims in this case. But they were also frustrated by a lack of guidance — both from existing case law and from Schwab and Hamilton’s arguments — on whether Trump can legally claim the power to issue such sweeping tariffs.

What the Nixon precedent tells us about Trump’s tariffs

Early in the argument, Schwab appeared to be in trouble, as he faced a barrage of questions about how the Yoshida decision cuts against some of his arguments. As Restani told him at one point, the argument that a statute permitting the president to “regulate” does not include the power to impose tariffs is a nonstarter, because Yoshida held the opposite.

That said, all three judges proposed ways to distinguish the Nixon tariffs upheld by Yoshida from the Trump tariffs now before the trade court.

Restani, for her part, argued that the Nixon tariffs involved a “very different situation” that was both “new” and “extraordinary.” For several decades, US dollars could be readily converted into gold at a set exchange rate. Nixon ended this practice in 1971, in an event many still refer to as the “Nixon shock.” When he did so, he briefly imposed tariffs to protect US goods from fluctuating exchange rates.

Yoshida, in other words, upheld temporary tariffs that were enacted in order to mitigate the impact of a sudden and very significant shift in US monetary policy, albeit a shift that Nixon caused himself. That’s a very different situation than the one surrounding Trump’s tariffs, which were enacted in response to ongoing trade deficits that have existed for many years.

Restani and Katzmann also pointed to a footnote in Yoshida that said Congress enacted a new law, the Trade Act of 1974, after the Nixon shock. This footnote states a future attempt to impose similar tariffs “must, of course, comply with the statute now governing such action.” Whatever power Nixon might have had in 1971, in other words, may now be limited by newer laws.

Reif also made a similar argument, pointing out that there is a separate federal statute dealing with trade practices such as “dumping,” when an exporter sells goods below their normal value. He questioned whether the president could bypass the procedures laid out in that anti-dumping statute by simply declaring an emergency, and then imposing whatever trade barriers the president wanted to impose under IEEPA.

That said, none of the judges — and neither of the lawyers — were able to articulate a rule that would allow future courts to determine which presidential actions are “unusual” or “extraordinary.” Hamilton’s suggestion that courts can’t decide this question at all sunk like a pair of concrete shoes, with Katzmann arguing that the IEEPA’s “unusual and extraordinary” provision would be entirely “superfluous” if Congress hadn’t intended courts to enforce it.

Schwab, meanwhile, earned a scolding from Restani when he kept trying to argue that Trump’s tariffs are such an obvious violation of the statute that there’s no need to come up with a broader legal rule. “You know it when you see it doesn’t work,” she told him — a reference to Justice Potter Stewart’s infamously vague standard for determining what constitutes pornography.

The three judges, in other words, expressed serious concerns about the Trump administration’s argument for the tariffs. But it’s not clear that they have figured out how to navigate the uncertain legal landscape looming over this case.

Will the decision be broad enough to matter in the long run?

Though the bulk of the argument focused on the four key words in the IEEPA, it’s not clear that a narrow decision holding that this law does not permit these tariffs will have much staying power.

Trump could potentially try to impose the tariffs again, using the somewhat more drawn out process laid out in the 1974 Trade Act, which permits the government to “impose duties or other import restrictions” after the US Trade Representative makes certain findings. So if the courts issue a narrow ruling against these tariffs, they may have to go through a very similar dog and pony show in a few months.

There are, however, two controversial legal doctrines popular with conservatives — known as “major questions” and “nondelegation” — which could lead to a more permanent reduction of Trump’s authority. Broadly speaking, both of these doctrines empower the courts to strike down a presidential administration’s actions even if those actions appear to be authorized by statute.

Late in the argument, Restani seemed to latch onto the nondelegation theory. Under current law, Congress may delegate power to the president or a federal agency so long as it “shall lay down by legislative act an intelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to [exercise the delegated authority] is directed to conform.” This “intelligible principle” test is famously very deferential to Congress.

Nevertheless, Restani asked some questions indicating that she may think that the IEEPA is the rare law which provides so little guidance to the president that it must be struck down. She noted that the law does permit Congress to pass a resolution canceling tariffs after the fact, but argued that this kind of after-the-fact review is not a substitute for an intelligible principle letting the president know how to act before he takes action.

The major questions doctrine, meanwhile, establishes that Congress must “speak clearly” if it wants to give the executive branch authority over matters of “vast ‘economic and political significance.’” By some estimates, Trump’s tariffs are expected to reduce real family income by $2,800, so that’s certainly a matter of vast economic importance. Thus, to the extent that the IEEPA’s language is unclear, the major questions doctrine suggests that the law should be construed to not permit these tariffs.

Hamilton’s primary argument against this line of reasoning is that the major questions doctrine does not apply to the president at all, only to actions by federal agencies that are subordinate to the president. But none of the three judges appeared sympathetic to this argument. Restani, in particular, seemed incredulous at the suggestion.

Overall, the judges seemed interested in exploring the nondelegation and major questions factors, and repeatedly rebutted suggestions that ruling on the tariffs was beyond their power. And that suggests the trade court will likely rule against the tariffs."|"The three-judge panel on the US Court of International Trade seemed troubled by the Trump administration’s claim that the judiciary may not review the legality of President Donald Trump’s tariffs at all.

Ghafoori says the move also affects thousands of Afghans in limbo, including 13 members of his own family that had been set to fly to the U.S. from Pakistan when the Trump administration canceled flights for Afghans earlier this year.

Ending TPS for Afghans is part of the administration's stated goal of realigning the United States refugee admissions program. It is a realignment that saw the Trump administration on Monday welcome the first group of white South African refugees under an executive order mandating that they be prioritized for resettlement.

""This administration is returning TPS to its original temporary intent,"" said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in a statement on Monday.

""We've reviewed the conditions in Afghanistan with our interagency partners, and they do not meet the requirements for a TPS designation. Afghanistan has had an improved security situation, and its stabilizing economy no longer prevent them from returning to their home country,"" she said.

Not forgotten

A chorus of dissenting voices has condemned the change as a betrayal to those who helped the U.S. at war or were stranded by the abrupt withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2001.

""To our Afghan allies, you are not alone, you are not forgotten,"" said Jack McCain, a veteran of the Afghan war and son of the late Sen. John McCain.

""Allies here in the United States who fought alongside people like me … who risked their lives and the lives of their families to execute our foreign policy are at the very real credible risk of deportation and in many many cases, death,"" said McCain in a statement on social media.

Bill Frelick with Human Rights Watch called the move to revoke the status for Afghans ""a betrayal of U.S. commitments.""

""The only justification for revoking temporary protection would be if permanent protection was being offered since Taliban rule clearly makes returns unsafe,"" he said.

As for Noem's assertion that the country is now safe, it left advocates wondering where the DHS is getting its information.

""I wonder if Secretary Noem is operating on the assumption that the Taliban has given promises that they're not going to put people that worked with the U.S. in harm's way?"" said Morwari Zafar, with the Georgetown University Center for Security Studies.

""Even if that were true, even if we could trust their word, it's not just the Taliban. You've got an environment where there are hostilities towards the population that would be coming back just based on the fact that they worked with the U.S. military – and also that they were the ones that got out,"" she said.

Veterans of the post-9/11 wars are among the most passionate advocates for protecting Afghans status. Many had taken encouragement that two of Trump's cabinet picks were staunch supporters of TPS for Afghans. Secretary of State Marco Rubio was one; he's recently gone quiet on the issue. Former National Security Adviser and Afghanistan war vet Mike Waltz was the other, and he appears to have been marginalized.

Some Republicans who condemned the Biden administration's ending of the Afghan war are now criticizing Trump.

""The Biden administration's withdrawal from Afghanistan was a catastrophe. Deporting Afghans who bravely helped us would be Trump's catastrophe,"" said Bradley Bowman with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. Bowman is an Afghanistan vet who also taught at West Point. He called deporting Afghan allies immoral but also short-sighted from an American national security standpoint.

""Around the world, countries are looking at the actions of the United States to determine whether Washington is a good partner that honors its commitments and stands by its friends,"" he said. ""If we deport such individuals, the consequences for those Afghans and their families may be severe and the decision will rightly be viewed as a betrayal.""

The immigration advocacy group CASA announced it has sued the Trump administration over its termination of TPS for Afghans and also Cameroonians. That action came at the same time the Trump administration made good on a promise to accept white South Africans into the U.S., citing what Trump baselessly claimed was a racial genocide against them.

Democratic Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, a Marine combat veteran, said the contrast was stark.

""As every Iraq or Afghanistan veteran knows, this is textbook betrayal. To say that the conditions in Afghanistan have improved as our allies are being hunted down is clearly absurd,"" he said in a statement to NPR. ""I know Kristi Noem doesn't understand the idea of risking your life for our country, but perhaps she understands outright racism in accepting Afrikaner 'refugees' in their place,"" he said in a statement to NPR."|"White House welcomes Afrikaners to the U.S., but drops protection for Afghan alliestoggle caption Jose Luis Magana/APAs many as 9,000 Afghan refugees are at risk of deportation, as the Trump administration has ended the temporary protected status (TPS) that allowed them to stay in the U.S. legally.

For Bonnie Ross, a clothing importer based in New York, news that the U.S. would temporarily cut tariffs on China came as a relief — at least for a short time.

""It was a great relief for about five minutes,"" Ross says.

Then the scramble began.

Ross had pulled two cargo containers off ships in China when the 145% tariffs took effect last month. Now she's trying to get as much merchandise to the U.S. as she can while the lower tariffs are in place.

Still, she worries that other businesses will be in the same crowded boat.

""Now it's going to be a rush because everybody wants it out in the next 90 days,"" Ross says. ""What is going to happen to the freight rates?""

For business owners like Ross, a cut in tariffs on China is welcome news — but it also prolongs uncertainty.

Although the U.S. and China agreed to slash the crippling tariffs they had imposed on each other, the lower import taxes are set to last for only 90 days — with no certainty of what happens afterward.

The tax on Chinese imports to the U.S. will drop from 145% to 30%, while the tariff China charges on U.S. goods will fall from 125% to 10%. The remaining tariffs are still significantly higher than the U.S. was charging before President Trump launched his trade war.

Getting through the next four to six weeks

Jay Foreman, whose Florida-based company makes Tinkertoys, Lincoln Logs and other toys in China, got news of the deal at 4:30 a.m. and immediately called associates in Hong Kong to begin scheduling shipments.

""We've been holding everything at the factories and at the ports, because we didn't want to risk putting anything on containers with a 145% tariff,"" Foreman says.

He says a 30% import tax is more manageable, although at least some of that cost will have to be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices.

""It's a complete disruption, but obviously I'm sure everybody in the supply chain would agree it's better than it was,"" Foreman says.

Some businesses may race to produce and ship products early for the Christmas holiday season to avoid the risk of higher tariffs in the fall. But that's also a gamble, Foreman says, because it's possible the administration will order lower tariffs at the end of the three-month window.

""Right now, I'm just trying to get through the next four to six weeks,"" he says. ""Whether I double-shift the factories to try to get more produced and out the door before the end of the 90 days, I'll probably need another three to four weeks to figure that out.""

A temporary deal is still better than none

Jonathan Silva runs a company in Massachusetts that produces high-end board games in China. He has nine containers of merchandise that he has been holding in China that he will now send to the United States.

""We need to get product back on shelves,"" Silva says. ""I think that we were really getting close to the tipping point of starting to see some shortages.""

""30% — it's not ideal,"" he adds. ""I think there will be slight price increases.""

But at least Silva is no longer afraid of going bankrupt.

For now, like other business owners, he's scrambling to produce and ship more games in time for the holiday shopping season.

""The spigot was turned on,"" Silva says. ""Everyone is going to be placing orders over the course of the next week, and we're placing our orders today for what we think we can get done in the next 90 days and try to save as much business for the holidays as we can.""

Whatever the tariff landscape looks like in 90 days, Silva says he'll be exploring alternatives to manufacturing in China, including other Asian countries and the United States.

""The past 40 days has been the hardest 40 days in all of our business's life,"" he says. ""And I'm glad that we're going to be able to come out of it. But we don't know what's going to happen tomorrow. It's very unpredictable."""|"Then, a scramble to get stuff in after U.S. cuts China tariffs for nowtoggle caption STR/AFP via Getty ImagesFor Bonnie Ross, a clothing importer based in New York, news that the U.S. would temporarily cut tariffs on China came as a relief — at least for a short time.

Last week, Newark Mayor Ras Baraka (D) was arrested at an ICE detention facility in the city after he and three Democratic members of Congress visited the complex. Baraka said he and the lawmakers were allowed in the facility and were there for an hour, and no one told him to leave. Ultimately, he was arrested by federal agents. Shortly afterward, Habba, the top prosecutor for the District of New Jersey, posted about the arrest on social media and phoned into Fox News.

“More than once, [he] refused to leave, was put under arrest inside the facility, walked out when he was told he was under arrest, and then was cuffed,” she said, and accused Baraka and the lawmakers of “grandstanding.” Habba has issued other public comments about the case.

According to Politico, U.S. Magistrate André M. Espinosa advised Habba’s office in a Friday video conference against giving public remarks about the case. After Baraka’s attorney asked Espinosa to warn Habba’s office, the magistrate addressed the government’s lawyers and said he would “caution them to heed carefully to the rules of professional conduct” and “boundaries of propriety for public comment related to an ongoing investigation and/or prosecution.”

Baraka maintains he did nothing wrong.

“Nobody told me to leave that place,” he told CNN last week. “Somebody from Homeland Security came in the end and began to escalate the situation, and we wind up being where we are today. And that’s, frankly, the extent of it.”

139|https://www.spotlightpa.org/statecollege/2025/05/penn-state-university-commonwealth-campus-closures-trustees-bendapudi/|Why Bendapudi is asking Penn State trustees to close 7 campuses • Spotlight PA|2025-05-13 16:09:30-04:00|"UPDATE: A few hours after this story was published, Penn State publicly shared the full recommendation report regarding the campus closures. “I am truly sorry that our community is learning of the recommendation through media coverage, rather than hearing about it with additional context directly from me or the board,” President Neeli Bendapudi said in a news release. Penn State President Neeli Bendapudi has asked university trustees to approve closing seven of its commonwealth campuses because the current statewide model “subsidizes decline,” according to internal records obtained by Spotlight PA. “Fulfilling our land-grant mission does not require a four-year campus in every corner of Pennsylvania,” the president wrote. Instead, under the proposal, online classes could replace some in-person offerings and a leaner university with fewer locations could invest in the parts of Pennsylvania where Penn State believes it can still succeed. Bendapudi has proposed closing Penn State’s DuBois, Fayette, Mont Alto, New Kensington, Shenango, Wilkes-Barre, and York campuses. More than 500 employees and thousands of students would be affected by the move. “These are not just campuses; they are homes, launching pads, and sources of deep pride. And yet … if we delay action, the pressures we face—demographic, financial, competitive—will continue to mount. In time, those forces will make decisions for us, not with the care, intention, or commitment to students and communities that this process allows,” Bendapudi wrote to trustees.

On Monday, the Philadelphia Inquirer first reported the list of seven campuses Bendapudi wanted to close. In response, board chair David Kleppinger said in a statement, “I find it deeply frustrating that someone with early access to this recommendation decided to share it with the media with absolutely no regard for how this information would impact members of our campus communities. Our students, faculty and staff deserve better.” But the Penn State Board of Trustees still needs to approve the plan, a vote that’s grown more contentious. Questions, as well as outright disapproval, from some trustees delayed a scheduled vote this week, according to people with knowledge of the board’s operations. Trustees will meet privately Thursday to continue discussing the proposal. Spotlight PA obtained the materials trustees are reviewing, which total almost 250 pages. The full text of the university’s recommendation and related materials offer the most detailed look to date at Penn State’s justification for potentially shuttering locations, upending the lives of thousands of employees and students, and markedly changing the educational landscape of Pennsylvania. The records provide a campus-by-campus rationale for closing, offer insights into how trustees feel about the decision, and reveal that Penn State officials anticipate minimal political and funding fallout from the move. Penn State’s Office of Strategic Communication told Spotlight PA Tuesday afternoon that “the University will not be able to make the deadline, but we will share a statement with you eventually, understanding we may not make publication.” In the documents, Penn State claims that previous university administrations failed to act. Closing campuses is presented to trustees as the only viable option: “We now have an opportunity to address what’s long been understood.” The documents note that enrollments at Penn State’s smallest 12 campuses continued declining despite more than $1 billion in investments between 2010 and 2024, including $105 million under Bendapudi. Likewise, they highlight that new academic programs, digital advertising, tuition discounts, and increased support for out-of-state and international students largely failed to boost enrollments. “The plan to close campuses was not the initial intent of this administration; rather, it was a discovered reality,” the documents say. The reasons for closing campuses Under the proposal, the new Penn State will be regionalized to incentivize larger classes and on-campus living instead of commuting. Locations that generate revenue or are near self-sustaining, those with the largest enrollments, and those in areas with growing populations will remain. Historical enrollment trends and opportunities for future growth were key factors in the university’s recommendation. Other criteria given significant weight were nearby housing availability and the ability to duplicate academic offerings at a nearby campus or online. The records include a multi-paragraph rationale for closing each of the seven campuses, which say in part: For DuBois, the main reason is “sustained and substantial enrollment decline,” the report reads. The population in the surrounding area — Clearfield, Elk, and Jefferson Counties — is aging and declining. Other organizations, like the Triangle Tech vocational school, are leaving the region too, the university argued.

At Fayette, successful programs at other campuses are not driving enrollments there. The campus is “underutilized,” and there is “limited demand for in-person education in this location.” While the local college-age population is expected to grow, Penn State faces regional competition with PennWest California and Waynesburg University.

Penn State recommends closing Mont Alto due to enrollment and demographic challenges. “The limited pool of prospective students constrains the campus’ ability to rebuild enrollment organically, even with aggressive outreach or new program development.” Declining use of campus housing is also driving up per-student costs.

New Kensington has “struggled to maintain relevance and scale in an increasingly competitive higher education environment” around Pittsburgh, the report reads. The campus’ offerings mirror other locations and nearby Penn State Beaver will maintain Penn State’s presence in the area.

For Shenango, declining populations and economic challenges in the surrounding region “fundamentally limit the potential for future enrollment stabilization.” Without more campus housing, Penn State could not bring more students to the campus, either.

Wilkes-Barre was recommended for closure because its campus is small and has limited housing, which makes it less appealing than nearby locations like Scranton and Hazleton. “There is no compelling academic niche or distinctive program portfolio at Penn State Wilkes-Barre that cannot be replicated or consolidated” at another campus or online.

Penn State York lacks the campus housing to attract non-commuter students. The nearby Harrisburg location has such housing and offers more diverse programming. Five other locations — Beaver, Greater Allegheny, Hazleton, Schuylkill, and Scranton — were considered but not recommended for closure. The university estimates closing the seven campuses would save around $50 million a year, along with clearing around $200 million in needed maintenance at the properties. The records do not offer an estimate of what it will cost to implement the plan.

The plan for employees, students Julio Palma, a Penn State Fayette professor, told Spotlight PA that shutting down a location is not innovation. Penn State is abandoning communities, like coal companies have done throughout Appalachia, he said. “This is a public university that receives funding from the state, it receives funding from taxpayers,” Palma said. “Those taxpayers are spread in every corner of the state. They are in Fayette. And while the taxpayers are supporting Penn State across the state, Penn State is closing doors, closing opportunities.” Penn State estimates that 520 full-time employees will be affected by the closures. Non-tenure-line faculty and staff could be rehired and could be given priority consideration for jobs at remaining campuses and University Park. “The largest expense will likely be severance costs for employees who are no longer employed by Penn State,” the recommendation says. No cost estimate is provided in the records, though the university expects to reduce such workforce expenses through attrition, retirements, and voluntary separations. More than 3,100 students were enrolled in the seven campuses in fall 2024, representing 3.6% of Penn State’s systemwide enrollment, according to university data. Other campuses could absorb these students without needing to hire additional staff, the university estimates. Affected students could receive additional financial aid, adjusted costs when attending another campus, or even gas cards, according to the proposal. These students will be offered “navigation coaches” who will help students clarify their goals, stay motivated, and find experts to answer their questions. Students at these campuses are not necessarily going to travel a greater distance to enroll at another campus, or they may not have the means, Andrea Adolph, a Penn State New Kensington professor, told Spotlight PA. The administration and trustees do not understand this reality, she said: “This is going to be an incredible blow to opportunities for students who can’t pick up and move somewhere else.” Penn State, in its recommendation, argues that fewer campuses will benefit students. “Treating all campuses the same would have meant continued subsidies to locations with little growth potential—ultimately disadvantaging students elsewhere across the commonwealth. With this recommendation, the University can focus on targeted investments where it can do the greatest good, particularly for first-generation, Pell-eligible, and underserved students.” Penn State will not accept new student applications for closed campuses after fall 2025. Will the plan pass? Trustees were expected to vote on Bendapudi’s proposal on Thursday but the volume of questions from board members, as well as consternation from some, have delayed the move. Thursday’s meeting will be a private executive session. The board also gathered Friday morning in private at University Park, during which they discussed the closure plan, according to a public statement by board Chair Kleppinger and people with knowledge of trustee discussions. In private, Kleppinger has told trustees the board should unanimously support Bendapudi’s proposal and that dissent could hurt her legacy, according to multiple sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private board dynamics. Kleppinger, in a statement to Spotlight PA, refuted that characterization and said: “Penn State’s board is specifically structured to include trustees from varying backgrounds and experiences to bring diverse viewpoints and opinions to University oversight matters, and there is absolutely room for every trustee to share their perspectives. The board asked President Bendapudi two years ago to look into the structure and health of the University’s Commonwealth Campus ecosystem. Significant work, over eighteen months has gone into the recommendation and my ask to the board is that we fully consider her recommendation and make a decision that is the best interest of the continued success of Penn State.” Last month, trustees Jay Paterno and Ted Brown, and later Nicholas Rowland, publicly questioned the administration’s approach to the decision and stated reasons in several op-eds in StateCollege.com. “Our campuses are not line items to cut or assets to liquidate; they are integral parts of the whole,” Rowland wrote. But several factors work in Bendapudi’s favor. The size of Penn State’s board — 36 voting members — requires a large number of trustees to vote against the measure to stop it. Also, trustees will take one vote on the proposal, not consider closures on a campus-by-campus basis. Finally, voting data shows that trustees are often loath to vote against an administration’s proposal. A previous Spotlight PA analysis of trustee votes between 2019 and 2024 found that they passed nearly 85% of measures without a single oppositional vote. The board voted down just four of the 328 measures it considered during this period, three of which were motions a trustee proposed mid-meeting. The other, in July, was an option for how trustees should be elected to the board. According to the board documents, trustees have questioned how the administration will implement the plan, the estimated costs and savings, and how Penn State could divest from the associated real estate. The records provide some insight into how Penn State’s governing body is thinking about the proposal given that, to date, the board has not held public discussions on the topic. The board previously planned a virtual-only meeting this week to vote on the plan, an act that legal experts previously told Spotlight PA could run afoul of Pennsylvania’s open meetings law. Someone could challenge the meeting in court, and if they were successful, a judge could potentially overturn the trustees’ votes, the lawyers told Spotlight PA. (Penn State did not respond to requests for comment at the time.) Consequences of a decision This spring, some members of the university community, including employees, called on Bendapudi to reconsider closing campuses. They felt the president’s reasons for weighing closures— at first financial and later about the student experience — lacked clarity and transparency. The vast majority of the more than 500 public comments Penn State received — from community members to alumni to lawmakers — asked the university to keep all locations open. Trustees received brief summaries of these comments. The recommendation documents note that some people said they supported closures but felt pressured to publicly say otherwise, though the report did not include further information about these claims. Opponents of campus closures did not offer any “fully developed or funded proposals,” the board’s documents say. Likewise, Bendapudi and her chief of staff, Michael Wade Smith, talked to Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro and state lawmakers, and “there have been no offers of financial support in these conversations,” the document reads. Shapiro’s office did not return a request for comment for this story. According to the internal documents, Penn State does not anticipate political or reputational fallout from the decision, nor does it think the hundreds of millions of dollars it receives each year in taxpayer funds, now under consideration, are in jeopardy. “We do not expect this decision to have long-term negative implications on the Penn State brand,” the documents read. “… We can expect short-term dissatisfaction within the local communities where campus closures will have an impact, which is likely to manifest in negative news coverage — local and regional.”"|"The reasons for closing campuses Under the proposal, the new Penn State will be regionalized to incentivize larger classes and on-campus living instead of commuting.

WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. health regulators announced an effort Tuesday to phase out ingestible fluoride supplements sometimes used to strengthen children’s teeth, opening a new front in Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s effort against a mainstay of dental care.

The Food and Drug Administration said it will conduct a scientific review of the children’s products by late October with the aim of removing them from the market. Formally withdrawing medical products requires a lengthy rulemaking process that can take years. Instead, the FDA will ask manufacturers to voluntarily pull their products, according to an administration official.

Fluoride tablets and lozenges are sometimes recommended for children and teens at increased risk of tooth decay or cavities because of low fluoride in their local drinking water. Companies also sell drops for babies.

FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said the products pose a risk when swallowed because they may interfere with healthy gut bacteria that are critical to digestion, immunity and other key bodily functions. He also referenced studies showing possible associations between excess fluoride intake and other problems, including decreased IQ.

The nation’s leading dental group said Tuesday the studies “do not in fact demonstrate any harmful effects” from fluoride at the levels used by dentists.

AP AUDIO: FDA and RFK Jr. aim to remove ingestible fluoride products used to protect kids’ teeth AP’s Lisa Dwyer reports on new plans to phase out the use of fluoride tablets.

“Proposals like this stand to hurt rural America, not make them healthier,” American Dental Association President Dr. Brett Kessler said. “More than ever, at this critical time in American health care policy, it is vital that we slow down to properly study the full implications of actions like this on the health of the nation.”

Officials in Utah — the first U.S. state to ban fluoride from drinking water — recently made fluoride supplements available without a prescription. As more state and local governments begin removing fluoride from their water, the need for supplemental fluoride is expected to grow.

Fluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 1962, the agency set guidelines for how much should be added to water.

Kennedy, a former environmental lawyer, has called fluoride a “dangerous neurotoxin” tied to a range of health dangers. Last month, he announced a task force to scrutinize fluoride’s use, while at the same time saying he would order the CDC to stop recommending that it be added to tap water.

A report last year by the federal government’s National Toxicology Program concluded that drinking water with more than twice the CDC’s recommended level was associated with lower IQs in kids. The study was based on research conducted in Canada, China, India, Iran, Pakistan and Mexico.

“Ending the use of ingestible fluoride is long overdue,” Kennedy said in a statement Tuesday. “This decision brings us one step closer to delivering on President Trump’s promise to Make America Healthy Again.”

An influential government health panel recommends fluoride supplements for children between the ages of six months and 5 years if they live in areas with low fluoridation levels. The U.S. Preventative Services Task Forces judged the recommendation to have “high certainty,” based on the available evidence.

A 2010 paper from the ADA recommended supplemental fluoride for children up to 16 years old who are at high risk of cavities. The recommendation was based on a review of studies across different age groups. The most common side effect associated with the products is spotting or discoloration of the teeth, caused by extra fluoride.

ADA’s Kessler said the FDA’s plan “will be particularly harmful to the most vulnerable and those who lack access to care.”

The FDA regulates most dental products, including fluoride-containing toothpastes, supplements, mouthwashes and rinses. But in Tuesday’s press release, the FDA said the ingestible products targeted by the agency have “never been approved.” The agency’s plan wouldn’t affect toothpastes, mouthwash or fluoride treatments used by adults or those offered in dentists’ offices.

In recent weeks fluoride-containing products have increasingly been targeted with lawsuits and legal actions.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced an investigation early this month into the marketing of fluoride toothpastes by Colgate-Palmolive and Proctor and Gamble. A press release from his office described the companies’ promotions as “misleading, deceptive and dangerous.”

One climber survived and drove to a pay phone|2025-05-13 23:27:02|"A rock climber who fell hundreds of feet descending a steep gully in Washington’s North Cascades mountains survived the fall that killed his three companions, hiked to his car in the dark and then drove to a pay phone to call for help, authorities said Tuesday.

The surviving climber, Anton Tselykh, 38, extricated himself from a tangle of ropes, helmets and other equipment after the fall Saturday evening. Despite suffering internal bleeding and head trauma, Tselykh eventually, over at least a dozen hours, made the trek to the pay phone, Okanogan County Undersheriff Dave Yarnell said.

The climbers who were killed were Vishnu Irigireddy, 48, Tim Nguyen, 63, Oleksander Martynenko, 36, Okanogan County Coroner Dave Rodriguez said.

Authorities haven’t yet been able to interview the survivor, who is in a Seattle hospital, said Rodriguez, so much is still unknown of the fall and Tselykh’s journey.

Falls like this leading to three deaths are extremely rare, said Cristina Woodworth, who leads the sheriff’s search and rescue team. Seven years ago, two climbers were killed in a fall on El Capitan at Yosemite National Park in California.

The group of four were scaling the Early Winters Spires, jagged peaks split by a cleft that is popular with climbers in the North Cascade Range, about 160 miles (257 kilometers) northeast of Seattle. Tselykh was hospitalized in Seattle.

The group of four met with disaster that night when the anchor used to secure their ropes was torn from the rock while they were descending, Rodriguez said. The anchor they were using, a metal spike called a piton, appeared to have been placed there by past climbers, he said.

They plummeted for about 200 feet (60 meters) into a slanted gulch and then tumbled another 200 feet before coming to rest, Yarnell said. Authorities believe the group had been ascending but turned around when they saw a storm approaching.

A three-person search and rescue team reached the site of the fall Sunday, Woodworth said. The team used coordinates from a device the climbers had been carrying, which had been shared by a friend of the men.

Once they found the site, they called in a helicopter to remove the bodies one at a time because of the rough terrain, Woodworth said.

On Monday, responders poured over the recovered equipment trying to decipher what caused the fall, Woodworth said. They found a piton — basically a small metal spike that is driven into rock cracks or ice and used as anchors by climbers — that was still clipped into the climbers’ ropes.

“There’s no other reason it would be hooked onto the rope unless it pulled out of the rock,” said Rodriguez, the coroner, noting that pitons are typically stuck fast in the rock. Rodriguez added that when rappelling, all four men would not have be hanging from the one piton at the same time, but taking turns moving down the mountain.

Pitons are oftentimes left in walls. They can be there for years or even decades, and they may become less secure over time.

“It looked old and weathered, and the rest of their equipment looked newer, so we are making the assumption that it was an old piton,” Woodworth said.

Rock climbers secure themselves by ropes to anchors, such as pitons or other climbing equipment. The ropes are intended to arrest their fall if they should slip, and typically climbers use backup anchors, said Joshua Cole, a guide and co-owner of North Cascades Mountain Guides, who has been climbing in the area for about 20 years.

Generally, it would be unusual to rappel off a single piton, said Cole, adding that it is still unknown exactly what happened on the wall that night.

“We eventually, if possible, would like to get more information from surviving party,” Woodworth said.

The spires are a popular climbing spot. The route the climbers were taking, said Cole, was of moderate difficulty, and requires moving between ice, snow and rock.

But the conditions, the amount of ice versus rock for example, can change rapidly with the weather, he said, even week to week or day to day, changing the route’s risks.

The drinking water rules were adopted as part of the Biden administration’s efforts to limit public exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), hazardous chemicals linked to range of serious illnesses. The original rule covered six common PFAS contaminants, including PFOA, a known human carcinogen, and PFOS, a likely carcinogen.

The EPA estimates that more than 158 million Americans are exposed to PFAS through their drinking water.

The agency plans to maintain current rules for PFOA and PFOS, though it will extend the deadline for compliance from 2029 to 2031.

In the documents reviewed by The Post, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said that the changes will “protect Americans from PFOA and PFOS in their drinking water” while providing “common-sense flexibility in the form of additional time for compliance.”

The EPA did not respond to a request for comment.

The agency’s action follows the release by the White House in March of a 36-page “National Strategy to End the Use of Paper Straws” that detailed the dangers of PFAS, saying the chemicals “are harmful to human health, and they have been linked to harms affecting reproductive health, developmental delays in children, cancer, hormone imbalance.”

PFAS are a large class of persistent chemicals used to make a wide array of consumer and industrial products that repel grease, water, oil and heat. Scientists have found them in the blood of almost every American and have detected the compounds in remote regions of the planet, such as Antarctica.

The regulations gave the 66,000 public water systems in the United States until 2029 to comply with the new standards. Under the rule, the maximum contamination level for PFOA and PFOS was set at 4 parts per trillion. Three other compounds — PFHxS, PFNA and GenX — were limited to 10 parts per trillion. In addition, the water standard required utilities to use a “hazard index” to monitor a mixture of the chemicals, as well as a fourth, PFBS.

In June, trade associations representing water utilities filed suit against the EPA, challenging the science and data underlying the drinking water standard and its timetable for meeting it. According to the agency’s estimates, the standard would cost utilities about $1.5 billion a year.

Under the agency’s new plan, according to the documents reviewed by The Post, the regulations covering PFHxS, PFNA, GenX, and PFBS will be rescinded and reconsidered. The agency plans to begin a new rulemaking process in the fall and to issue the new rule next spring. The agency also plans to start a program called PFAS OUT to “share resources, tools, funding and technical assistance to help utilities meet the federal drinking water standards.”

Erik Olson, the senior strategic director for health at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an advocacy group that is a party to the lawsuit, said the Safe Drinking Water Act’s “anti-backsliding” provision bars the agency from repealing or weakening the drinking water standard.

“The law is very clear that the EPA can’t repeal or weaken the drinking water standard. Any effort to do so will clearly violate what Congress has required for decades,” Olson said. “It shows that this administration doesn’t really care about protecting people’s drinking water from toxic forever chemicals that endanger the health of over 100 million Americans.”

The American Water Works Association, a trade group that sued the EPA over the PFAS rule, did not provide a comment, saying it would wait until the official EPA announcement before considering a response.

Linda Birnbaum, the former director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, said the agency’s decision to remove restrictions on the known substitutions for PFOS and PFOA was concerning.

“It’s too bad. We know these chemicals are dangerous. We know their adverse health effects. The more we study them, the more problems we face,” Birnbaum said. “If anything, the science is stronger today that it was a year or two years ago.”

GenX has been linked to kidney and liver toxicity, immune and development effects and cancer in rats, according to an EPA toxicity assessment.

Emily Donovan, who lives near Wilmington, North Carolina, an area affected by the release of GenX into the Cape Fear River, said that communities will bear the brunt of the EPA’s decision."|"The Environmental Protection Agency plans to rescind and reconsider limits on four different “forever chemicals” under a landmark drinking water standard implemented last year by President Joe Biden, according to documents reviewed by The Washington Post.

Karen Read’s murder trial will not be in session Tuesday due to “unavoidable circumstances,” according to a court spokesperson.

The alert was sent to media outlets shortly before the day’s testimony was slated to begin at 9 a.m. The spokesperson gave no further details, and the Norfolk Superior Court clerk’s office and security were unable to provide any explanation.

A court official later confirmed Tuesday’s testimony was canceled due to health reasons and said a brief closed-door hearing held around 11 a.m. concerned scheduling. Prosecutors and members of the O’Keefe family could be seen talking outside the courthouse Tuesday morning.

Read’s trial entered its fourth week Monday. Jurors began the week with a third and final full day of testimony from Massachusetts State Police Sgt. Yuriy Bukhenik, one of the troopers who investigated the death of Read’s boyfriend, Boston Police Officer John O’Keefe.

Read, 45, is accused of drunkenly and intentionally ramming O’Keefe with her SUV while dropping him off at an afterparty in Canton early on Jan. 29, 2022. While prosecutors allege she left O’Keefe to die in a blizzard, Read’s lawyers have suggested O’Keefe was attacked after entering the home. They contend Read was framed in a vast conspiracy among law enforcement and afterparty guests.

Taking the stand Monday, Bukhenik faced intense questioning about one guest in particular: federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives agent Brian Higgins. Read’s lawyers have sought to implicate Higgins in their third-party culprit defense, suggesting he had motive to harm O’Keefe after sharing flirty texts — and a kiss — with Read while she was in her relationship with O’Keefe.

However, Bukhenik testified Monday he found no evidence pointing to any animosity between O’Keefe and Higgins or homeowner Brian Albert.

The ongoing trial is Read’s second, after jurors in her first trial returned deadlocked last summer.

Opponents of the proposal were stunned at its sweeping implications. While it is in line with President Trump’s agenda, it had been considered somewhat of a long shot to make it out of the House Ways and Means Committee, because of its cost.

The program is structured as a $5 billion tax credit, allowing donors to reduce their tax bill by $1 for every $1 they give to nonprofits that grant scholarships — up to 10 percent of the donor’s income.

The option to donate is expected to be popular with wealthy taxpayers.

The resulting scholarships could be worth $5,000 per child, reaching one million students. Any family who earns less than 300 percent of their area’s median income — which equals over $300,000 in some parts of the country — could use the funds, meaning a vast majority of families would be eligible.

The proposal could pass through the budget reconciliation process, and could become law with only 51 votes in a Senate where Republicans hold 53 seats."|"Opponents of the proposal were stunned at its sweeping implications.

Meink, who previously served as deputy director of the National Reconnaissance Office, will now take charge of the Air Force and Space Force. He has a deep background in acquisition and technology development specializing in space and also served as NRO’s director of signals intelligence systems acquisition.

His career at the Air Force has included service as deputy undersecretary of the Air Force for space and, while at the Air Force Research Laboratory in New Mexico, stints as a program manager, senior research engineer and chief technical adviser. He served in the Air Force beginning in 1988 as a navigator on the KC-135 Stratotanker.

Meink will take over the Department of the Air Force at a time of significant transformation, as virtually all major portions of its aircraft fleet are in the process of modernizing. That includes overseeing the service’s planned sixth-generation fighter, dubbed the F-47, as prime contractor Boeing begins the complicated process of developing and then delivering a complex, advanced aircraft without breaking the bank.

The Air Force is also developing multiple versions of semiautonomous drone wingmen, known as collaborative combat aircraft, that will fly alongside the F-47, the F-35A Joint Strike Fighter and potentially other aircraft.

The service is in the midst of a major revamp of its bomber force as it brings on the Northrop Grumman B-21 Raider stealth bomber to replace the retiring B-1 and B-2 bombers. The Air Force eventually plans to have a two-bomber fleet made up of the B-21, alongside heavily revamped B-52J Stratofortresses.

And the Air Force is worried about its LGM-35A Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile. That program, which is to be built by Northrop Grumman, is planned to succeed the aging Minuteman III nuclear missile program, but higher-than-expected construction costs have forced the service to rethink its approach to Sentinel.

Meink’s acquisition background could help the service manage these multiple programs. His space expertise could also benefit the Space Force, whose missions are expanding and which has sought to grow its budget to handle them.

In his nomination hearing in March, Meink pledged to push for the Space Force to get the resources it needs, given the growing role it will likely play in future military actions.

“Space is going to be one of the determining factors” in a future conflict, Meink said. “We definitely need to get that right.”

But Meink’s relationship with SpaceX founder and Trump administration adviser Elon Musk created controversy. Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Tammy Duckworth of Illinois in February raised concerns about what they termed a “potential quid pro quo” between Meink and Musk, after reports surfaced that Meink had favored SpaceX for a contract while running NRO.

“These are incredibly serious allegations of misconduct and favoritism,” they wrote in a letter to Meink. “These reports raise concerns about your ability, if confirmed as secretary, to treat contractors fairly and prioritize the Air Force’s mission over Elon Musk’s business interests.”

According to a Politico report, Meink disclosed to lawmakers in written responses that Musk was present for his interview with Trump, but said several other people were also present and Musk did not ask any questions. Musk’s presence at the interview raised eyebrows among some ethics experts, who called it unusual.

Meink denied having a relationship with Musk or SpaceX beyond executing his duties as head of NRO, and said he did not ask for Musk to support him to be Air Force secretary, nor did Musk ask him for anything.

Pushing back on Trump’s designation of Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche as acting librarian, lawmakers said Tuesday that control of the institution remains with its top career official, Robert R. Newlen. Newlen told staff at the library that he is the acting head, according to an email obtained by The Washington Post.

The president installed Blanche — a close Trump ally and his former defense attorney — as the acting head of the library just days after he abruptly fired Carla Hayden, the first woman and African American to serve as librarian of Congress, on Friday, nine years into her 10-year term.

The White House has not publicly announced Blanche’s new role, but a Justice Department official confirmed it, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive personnel matters.

The Library of Congress declined to comment. The White House press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

On Capitol Hill, Democrats said Tuesday they did not believe that Blanche was the acting librarian — and Republicans, who have repeatedly deferred to Trump even as he has wrested control of federal spending from authorities, indicated that they wanted to maintain their power around the library, which is part of the legislative branch even though the president nominates its leader.

“We made it clear that there needs to be a consultation around this — that there are equities that both Article I and Article II branches have [with] the Library of Congress,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-South Dakota) told reporters Tuesday, referring to the legislative and executive branches, adding that Trump administration officials had met with members of the Senate Rules and Administration Committee, which oversees the library.

Advertisement

Still, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-New York) attacked Republicans as “a compliant rubber stamp” for Trump’s agenda and said Democrats would “look into” the president’s firing of Hayden. He hinted at possible litigation.

“It’s the Library of Congress, not the library of the executive branch,” Jeffries told reporters. “This is an example of executive overreach.”

Sen. Alex Padilla (California), the top Democrat on the Rules Committee, said administration officials understood that the institution remains under the control of Newlen, not Blanche.

“For the time being, the acting librarian is the acting librarian,” Padilla said in an interview Tuesday. “The folks that President Trump is trying to put in place seem to be respecting that, and we continue to talk to our Republican colleagues on defending the legislative branch.”

Padilla met Tuesday afternoon with Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky), the chair of the Rules Committee, to discuss a bipartisan response to the administration’s move.

McConnell’s aides declined to comment on the meeting and did not address the nature of the standoff.

Newlen told library staffers Monday that he was waiting to hear from Congress about the next steps in the leadership transition, but he referred to himself as the acting head.

“You may have read that the White House has named a new acting Librarian,” Newlen wrote, according to a copy of one email obtained by The Post. “Currently Congress is engaged with the White House, and we have not yet received direction from Congress on how to move forward. We will share additional information as we receive it.”

The issue is simmering inside the Democratic caucus, where senators discussed the matter during their weekly policy luncheon Tuesday.

Padilla said some senators raised concern about potential abuse by the administration, including worries about the copyright office that the library controls, but the overarching issue was about defending an institution controlled by Congress from a hostile takeover by the president.

“This is the Library of Congress, not the library of the president,” he said, explaining his remarks to his colleagues during the closed-door meeting. “To be clear, this is not a Democrat versus Republican thing. This is a separation-of-powers, co-equal-branches-of-government discussion.”"|"Newlen told staff at the library that he is the acting head, according to an email obtained by The Washington Post.

The girl -– one of three U.S.-born children who were deported alongside their Honduran-born mothers -– had been at the heart of one of the mounting legal battles playing out in the United States weighing if the Trump administration broke the law in implementing its new deportation policies.

“Given the traumatizing experiences the families have been through, they are taking a step back to have full discussions about all their options, the safety and well-being of their children, and the best ways to proceed so the harms they have suffered can be fully addressed,” said Gracie Willis, one of the family’s lawyers.

The lawsuit was brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, National Immigration Project and several other allied groups, which said the deportations were a “shocking — although increasingly common — abuse of power.”

Willis and the group of lawyers had argued that the families did not have a fair opportunity to decide whether they wanted the children to stay in the United States. Willis said the family of the 2-year-old girl and their lawyers jointly decided to dismiss the case to give the family “space and time to consider all the options that are available to them.”

A federal judge in Louisiana had raised questions about the girl’s deportation, saying the government did not prove it had done so properly.

The Honduran-born mother — who is pregnant — was arrested in April on an outstanding deportation order along with the girl and her 11-year-old Honduran-born sister during a check-in appointment at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in New Orleans, lawyers said. The family lived in Baton Rouge.

Lawyers for the girl’s father insisted he wanted the girl to remain with him in the U.S., while ICE said the mother had wanted the girl to be deported with her to Honduras.

In a court filing, lawyers for the father said ICE indicated that it was holding the girl in a bid to induce the father to turn himself in.

U.S. District Judge Terry Doughty in Louisiana had scheduled a hearing for the case later this week, saying it was “in the interest of dispelling our strong suspicion that the Government just deported a U.S. citizen with no meaningful process.”

A federal judge on Tuesday seized control of New York City's notorious jail complex on Rikers Island, which will now be run by an official who reports directly to the court.

In a 77-page ruling, Judge Laura Taylor Swain wrote that she found the conduct of the city over the last nine years ""leaves no doubt that continued insistence on compliance with the court's orders by persons answerable principally to political authorities would lead only to confrontation and delay.""

She also wrote ""that the current management structure and staffing are insufficient to turn the tide within a reasonable period; that defendants have consistently fallen short of the requisite compliance with court orders for years, at times under circumstances that suggest bad faith; and that enormous resources -- that the city devotes to a system that is at the same time overstaffed and underserved -- are not being deployed effectively.""

The manager, who will report to the judge, will work with the city's jails commissioner and will be ""empowered to take all actions necessary"" to fix the complex.

""While the necessary changes will take some time, the court expects to see continual progress toward these goals,"" the judge wrote.

Critics have described brutal, violent and inhumane conditions inside the jail for years.

New York Mayor Eric Adams addressed the ruling during a news conference at city hall on Tuesday, saying that Rikers' problems were ""decades in the making."" He claimed that the legal requirement that the jail close in 2027 limited his administration's ability to address them.

""It stated you can't make any capital improvements on Rikers Island,"" Adams said. ""We can't spend money on Rikers Island to improve the conditions.""

152|https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/13/philadelphia-1985-move-bombing|‘Timestamp on our minds’: Philadelphia marks 1985 Move bombing that killed 11|2025-05-13 00:00:00|"Philadelphia is holding an official day of remembrance on Tuesday marking the moment 40 years earlier when the city’s police department dropped a bomb on the headquarters of a Black liberation organisation, sparking an inferno that killed 11 people – including five children.

The police bombing of the home of the Move organization on 13 May 1985 was one of the worst atrocities carried out during the era of the 1970s and 1980s Black liberation struggle. It followed a prolonged siege in which the notoriously brutal Philadelphia police attempted to drive the group out of its premises at 6221 Osage Avenue.

Officers pummeled the house with more than 10,000 rounds of ammunition over a 90-minute period, even though children were known to be inside. When that failed to dislodge the Move activists, authorities ordered a police helicopter to drop an incendiary bomb made from C4 plastic explosives on to the roof of the house.

A fire was ignited and allowed to rage, killing all 11 people and turning to cinder 61 houses in the mainly Black neighborhood. About 250 people were left homeless.

Five children aged seven to 13 died in the inferno. They were named Tree, Netta, Deleisha, Little Phil and Tomasa.

Jamie Gauthier, a Philadelphia city council member who represents the area in which the bombing occurred, called the event “the darkest day in our city’s modern history”. Her motion calling for the 40th anniversary of the bombing to be marked with an official day of remembrance was adopted by the council last week.

“The story about the Move bombing is still being written, it is up to us to decide its ending,” Gauthier said. “If we take the easy way out and let this tragedy fade from memory, we doom ourselves to a future where those who come after us repeat the mistakes Philly’s leaders made 40 years ago.”

She added: “We must keep the infamy of the Move bombing alive and fight for reconciliation and justice so that none of our constituents hear the whistle of a bomb being dropped on their home ever again.”

Despite the devastation caused by the bombing, no Philadelphia official was ever criminally prosecuted for it. It took 35 years for the city to apologise for the violence it had inflicted on its own citizens.

On the 35th anniversary of the bombing, Wilson Goode, Philadelphia’s first Black mayor who accepted responsibility for the attack, expressed his desire for a formal apology in an article in the Guardian, saying: “Many in the city still feel the pain of that day – I know I will always feel the pain.”

Tuesday’s commemoration of the events that day is scheduled to be held at 6221 Osage Avenue – at 5.27pm, the precise moment the bomb was dropped. Mike Africa Jr, whose uncle and cousin both died in the bombing, has bought the now rebuilt house and plans to convert it into a memorial of the bombing.

He told the Guardian that the bombing, which occurred when he was six years old, was a “timestamp on our minds. It never goes away – you think of it every day. It’s haunting to know that your family was killed in such a brutal, senseless way.”

Africa Jr said that the bombing was a scar that would never heal. “The only thing we can do is keep moving forward and try to prevent this from happening again,” he said."|"It followed a prolonged siege in which the notoriously brutal Philadelphia police attempted to drive the group out of its premises at 6221 Osage Avenue.

Hasan Piker, who has 2.8 million followers on Twitch, recounted his experience online Monday saying he was questioned for hours a day earlier despite being born in the U.S. and enrolled in Global Entry, a federal program allowing low-risk passengers to travel through customs and passport control quickly.

Piker believes he was targeted because of his views and said Customs and Border Protection officers asked his opinion of Trump and Hamas, among other topics. The liberal political commentator is frequently critical of Israel and the war in Gaza.

“The goal here is to put fear into people’s hearts, to have a chilling effect on speech,” Piker recounted in a detailed nearly 40-minute long account on his YouTube channel. “The government is now officially willing and able to intimidate you for your speech. That is a direct violation of the First Amendment.”

Piker did not have comment Tuesday beyond his Twitch stream a day earlier, according to a spokesman. The hours-long broadcast on the live streaming platform included the same account posted on YouTube along with Piker’s commentary on other topics and his speaking engagement at the University of Chicago.

Federal officials dismissed Piker’s account of the detention on Tuesday, calling the questioning “routine and lawful” and something that can apply to any traveler.

“This is nothing but lying for likes. Claims that his political beliefs triggered the inspection are baseless,” Tricia McLaughlin, U.S. Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary, said in a statement. “Once his inspection was complete, he was promptly released.”

The Trump administration’s aggressive crackdown on immigration and student protests have also increased worries among U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents navigating the last steps to citizenship. Recent immigration arrests have mistakenly swept up U.S. citizens in Illinois,Florida and other places.

Trump has deemed the pro-Palestinian campus protests as “anti-American” while critics say student arrests are part of an unprecedented attack on the freedom of speech. Last month a Palestinian man who led protests against the war in Gaza as a student was arrested during what he thought was an interview about his citizenship.

Federal officials declined to give further details about Piker’s detention, including what prompted the extensive questioning.

Piker, also known as HasanAbi on Twitch, was born in New Jersey. The 33-year-old was raised in Turkey. He lives in Los Angeles.

“I’m not intimidated,” he said on YouTube, where he has 1.6 million subscribers. “I’m going to keep doing what I’m doing.”"|"CHICAGO (AP) — A popular Turkish American online streamer who is critical of President Donald Trump was recently detained and questioned at O’Hare International Airport after his flight from Paris landed in Chicago.

Many people across the United States are rushing to replace their driver’s licenses and state IDs with federally compliant licences, known as Real ID cards, now required to board domestic flights.

As of May 7, all US citizens more than 18 years of age must show proof of identification that meets the 2005 Real ID Act’s rules, which set higher federal security standards. But this change in federal travel requirements is creating some confusion about what it means for noncitizens.

Passed two decades ago by Congress in response to the bipartisan 9/11 Commission’s recommendations following the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York, Pennsylvania and Washington, DC, the aim of the programme was to raise security standards for domestic travel and federal and nuclear facility access.

But immigration experts say the law’s enactment during the second Trump administration has left noncitizens – including some of the 13.5 million people legally in the US on green cards, work and student visas and humanitarian parole – uncertain about what the rule change could mean for their travel.

US President Donald Trump has promised and prioritised mass deportations of criminals and undocumented people in the US. But in practice, his policies have swept up US citizens and people with a legal immigration status. He has also tried to end legal pathways that allowed people to temporarily live and work in the US. Many of these actions are being challenged in court.

Here are some answers to commonly asked questions about Real ID and its effect on citizen versus noncitizen travel.

What is special about Real ID?

The Department of Homeland Security says the aim of the Real ID requirements was to bring consistency to the minimum documentation requirements needed for state-issued IDs – driver’s license, learner’s permits and nondriver IDs.

Now, all states issuing Real ID-compliant cards require people applying for those cards to present certain documentation. The exact requirements vary by state, but in most cases, the minimum documents needed include:

Proof of identity in the form of a US birth certificate, US passport, or a green card.

Social Security Number in the form of a Social Security card, W-2 form, or a pay stub.

Two proofs of address of principal residence, which may be a utility bill, bank statement or mortgage statement.

Lawful status proof, including a valid employment authorisation document, Social Security Number or a valid unexpired visa.

A Real ID card bears a black or gold star or a US flag in its upper right corner. State-issued ID cards that don’t have these markers will not be accepted as proof of identity to board domestic flights or enter federal facilities.

Here are some examples of what Real IDs look like:

Examples of Real ID-compliant driver’s licenses posted on the Department of Homeland Security’s website.

If I don’t have a Real ID, does it mean I cannot travel domestically any more?

No, you can still travel domestically provided you have another form of identification that is Real ID-compliant.

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) lists many other forms of acceptable IDs, including options for people who are not US citizens. Among them:

State-issued enhanced driver’s licenses or enhanced IDs, which provide proof of identity when crossing the US borders in a vehicle.

US passports or US passport cards.

Foreign government-issued passports.

Department of Homeland Security trusted traveller cards under programmes such as Global Entry, which let US citizens, green card holders and some foreign nationals go through expedited lanes at airports.

US Department of Defense IDs, including IDs issued to dependents of people in the military.

Lawful permanent resident cards, also known as green cards.

Border crossing cards, a document used by Mexican citizens to enter the US.

Acceptable photo IDs issued by federally recognised tribal nations, including enhanced tribal cards.

HSPD-12 PIV cards, which are used by federal contractors to access facilities and systems.

Canadian provincial driver’s license or Indian and Northern Affairs Canada cards.

Transportation Worker Identification Credentials (TWIC).

US Citizenship and Immigration Services Employment Authorization Cards.

US Merchant Mariner Credentials, which show evidence of a mariner’s qualifications; and

Veteran Health Identification Cards (VHIC).

There’s one big caveat: TSA says the list of acceptable IDs is subject to change without notice and advises travellers to check the list before travelling.

How could Real ID affect noncitizens as they travel in the US?

Although numerous forms of IDs are accepted for noncitizens, the Real ID policy could have a chilling effect on travelers whose documentation differentiates them from citizens, immigration experts told us.

As one example, immigration attorney Prerna Lal said that, in any interaction with federal authorities, carrying a foreign passport could lead to scrutiny of that person’s identity if they lack legal immigration status.

“Even with valid foreign passports, undocumented individuals and mixed-status families may avoid travelling due to concerns about interactions with TSA or law enforcement, despite passports remaining acceptable documentation,” Lal said. “This fear of enforcement, rather than access to IDs, is the primary chilling effect on the immigrant community.”

What happens if people don’t have an acceptable ID at the airport?

A TSA officer may ask a person to complete an identity verification process. If the identity is confirmed, that person will be allowed to enter the screening checkpoint.

Can an immigrant with temporary status obtain a Real ID?

Yes, the Real ID regulations define an individual in a “temporary lawful status” as a person who has a pending application for asylum; has a pending or approved application for temporary protected status; has approved deferred action; or has a pending application for lawful permanent resident or conditional permanent resident status.

The Real ID Act lets states issue temporary, Real ID driver licenses and ID cards to people with temporary status. People with a temporary immigration status are usually granted temporary valid employment authorisation and Social Security numbers, which they can use to apply for Real IDs. Their temporary Real ID will remain valid until their lawful status expires. Florida is one exception: The Sunshine State requires almost all immigrants with lawful status to renew their IDs annually. Green card holders in Florida don’t have to renew a REAL ID every year; their Real ID is valid until their green card expires. Most green cards are valid for 10 years, but people can apply for a renewal.

Also, people with valid student or work visas can present their unexpired passports, visas and I-94 forms – documents that show a person’s authorised period of stay in the US – for proof of identity and legal status and get a Real ID.

States that provide non-Real ID compliant ID cards to people without legal immigration status can still do so, according to DHS, but the cards must clearly state that they are not acceptable for Real ID purposes and must have a unique design or colour to differentiate them from compliant cards. These non-Real ID-compliant ID cards cannot be used as a form of identification for domestic travel.

Could a Real ID prevent an arrest by immigration authorities? Does it confirm that a person is legally in the US?

Lal told PolitiFact that a Real ID alone does not prevent a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s arrest or confirm a lawful immigration status. Although Real ID-compliant identification requires proof of lawful presence for issuance, it is not proof of current immigration status.

“ICE conducts its own verification, and possessing a Real ID does not grant immunity from enforcement actions,” Prerna said.

Prerna said that people should present to ICE valid, government-issued documentation that shows their current immigration status, such as a green card, employment authorisation card or visa."|"Here are some answers to commonly asked questions about Real ID and its effect on citizen versus noncitizen travel.

157|https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-birthright-citizenship-supreme-court-injunctions-1235337779/|What’s at Stake as Trump’s Assault on Birthright Citizenship Heads to the Supreme Court|2025-05-13 13:00:00+00:00|"The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments over President Donald Trump’s executive order to end birthright citizenship on Thursday. Trump signed the order, “Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship,” on the first day of his second term, but it has since been halted by nationwide injunctions issued by three separate federal district courts.

The Supreme Court is taking up the issue after the Trump administration filed emergency appeals asking the justices to narrow the injunction orders so the policy could move forward in some capacity while the issue is battled out in courts around the country. Twenty-two states have sued over the ostensibly unconstitutional executive order, which seeks to end the practice of granting citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil.

Rolling Stone spoke with legal experts Christopher M. Lapinig and Christopher W. Schmidt about the significance of the Supreme Court’s decision to hear oral arguments, the merits of the cases challenging the order, and the broader impact of the Trump administration’s attack on the 14th Amendment.

Lapinig is an attorney with Asian Law Caucus, co-counsel alongside American Civil Liberties Union Foundation Immigrants’ Rights Project, State Democracy Defenders Fund, NAACP Legal Defense & Educational Fund, and others on New Hampshire Indonesian Community Support, et al v. Donald J. Trump, et al (this birthright citizenship case is separate from those the Supreme Court is convening over on May 15). Schmidt is a law professor and co-director of the Institute on the Supreme Court of the United States at Chicago Kent College of Law and a research professor at the American Bar Foundation.

It’s unclear exactly which questions the Supreme Court will take up on Thursday. But the oral arguments will likely have less to do with the constitutionality of birthright citizenship, and more to do with judicial authority and a contentious issue that has affected both parties in recent administrations: how lower courts can issue nationwide injunctions essentially inhibiting a president from instituting policies nationwide. The decision on that issue would not only impact these birthright citizenship cases, but the hundreds of other lawsuits challenging the Trump administration’s actions that are in the pipeline.

Editor’s picks

Here’s what else is at stake:

What Does the 14th Amendment Say About Birthright Citizenship?

The 14th Amendment, passed by Congress in 1866 and ratified in 1868, is pretty cut and dry regarding birthright citizenship: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.” It has long been widely interpreted that anyone born on U.S. soil is an American citizen, regardless of the citizenship of the child’s parents.

“It essentially was part of the efforts to make sure that slavery would not happen again, or anything resembling slavery would not happen again. And so the drafters of the 14th Amendment were abolitionists, right? They were anti-slavery, and they created this language with the idea of anti-subordination in mind,” Lapinig says. “And what that means is essentially that they wanted to make sure that no person in the United States would be subordinated or relegated to second-class citizens or something else by virtue of their race or their ethnicity or national origin.”

Drafters built “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” into the amendment’s language. Lapinig says they “contemplated that birthright citizenship should not extend to invaders, for example,” but that “it’s otherwise clear from the sort of discussions leading up to the enactment of the 14th Amendment that, of course, the 14th Amendment was to make sure that children of formerly enslaved people would be citizens by birth.” Related Content

“They also made clear,” he continues, “that they knew that, for example, children of immigrants from places like China or anywhere else would also be U.S. citizens by birth if they were born in the United States.”

What Is Trump’s Argument Regarding Birthright Citizenship?

The “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” line in the 14th Amendment is the key to the Trump administration’s argument.

“They are arguing that the categories of people that they are attempting to exclude are not subject to jurisdiction,” Schmidt says. “Their argument being that if you’re not legally in the country, [or] temporarily, you’re not, in some sense, subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. Now, even as I talk through that, it doesn’t seem to really resonate in any meaningful way when people think about why you’re subject to jurisdiction.”

“That was put in there to exclude people like someone born to a foreign diplomat who is subject to a different set of rules, even when they’re in the United States, perhaps also Native American populations who are not fully subject to the control of the United States. So, there were certain groups of people who were thought to fit in that category at the time.”

Both the text and the amendment’s history are not favorable to Trump’s argument.

“‘Subject to jurisdiction’ basically means, does the United States sovereign have control, or can it regulate you, like it can regulate other people? And whether you’re in the country legally or not, you’re subject to the sovereign authority of the United States, which is why [the jurisdiction argument] just doesn’t seem to make a lot of sense, just in terms of the language,” Schmidt says. “Also, for those people who studied immigration policy around the time of the 14th Amendment … the categories of ‘legal,’ ‘illegal,’ ‘documented,’ ‘undocumented’ — they were not categories that had much or any meaning at the time. The process by which someone would enter the country or leave the country was not nearly as regulated … And there wasn’t this sort of idea that there is a separate category of people who are undocumented or illegal immigrants.”

He adds: “This is a provision of the Constitution that has always struck me as being more clear than much of the Constitution.”

What Is the Precedent Against Trump’s Birthright Citizenship Executive Order?

Notably, beyond the text and history arguments when interpreting the Constitution against Trump’s executive order, there is also strong precedent against it with the Supreme Court’s ruling in United States v. Wong Kim Ark, in which the justices decided 6-2 in favor of Wong Kim Ark.

In the New Hampshire lawsuit, along with the other cases involving birthright citizenship, lawyers cite the 1898 case. Wong Kim Ark was a Chinese-American cook born in San Francisco in 1873. “His parents, who were from China, because of the Chinese Exclusion Act, were ineligible to be U.S. citizens,” Lapinig says.

Wong Kim Ark left the U.S. for China to see his family and his wife, whom he married on a previous trip (“Chinese immigration, especially Chinese women, were restricted” at the time, Lapinig says), but when he returned home to San Francisco, he was denied reentry by immigration officials on the claim that he was not a U.S. citizen, despite being born in San Francisco. He and his lawyers argued he was a U.S. citizen under the 14th Amendment. The case made it all the way to the Supreme Court, which sided with Wong Kim Ark. The ruling “enshrined the right to birthright citizenship for all babies, all children born in the United States to this day,” says Lapinig.

In addition to the pretty straightforward legal precedent against Trump’s executive order, Schmidt notes that it’s “just established practice” that birthright citizenship applies to anyone born in the U.S., even if their parents are undocumented, and that “Congress has been operating under the assumption this is the proper reading of the 14th Amendment for generations.”

Why Is the Supreme Court’s Decision to Hear Oral Arguments Significant Beyond the Constitutional Challenge?

The Supreme Court’s move to hear oral arguments is unusual because typically when the Supreme Court schedules oral arguments, it’s after granting certiorari, meaning the court has agreed to review a decision from a lower court. “The striking thing about the granting of oral arguments in the birthright citizenship cases is that they did not grant certiorari in any of the cases, nor did they identify a question presented that they’re going to be talking about,” Schmidt says.

There are a couple of topics that could be addressed on May 15. The first is the one Trump brought to the court: the validity of nationwide injunctions, which the district courts involved in the cases issued after deeming the executive order likely unconstitutional. “This is what the Trump administration went to the court saying: ‘We want you to lift these nationwide injunctions, because it’s an abuse of judicial authority,’” says Schmidt. “So, it’s highly likely that the court will want to hear some discussion simply about that problem, which certainly is sharply put into focus with this case, but it actually transcends this particular case. It’s just about the scope of district court authority on these national issues.”

The other topic is the substantive question of the lawsuits, which is unlikely to be discussed on Thursday as the administration only asked the court, so far, to narrow the nationwide injunctions. The question is a big one, though: “The constitutionality of a redefinition of birthright citizenship away from what’s been understood for over 100 years, to make it more narrowly applied, namely, at least according to the Trump executive order, to not apply to people who were born in the United States but to parents who are not in the United States with legal documentation or are only here temporarily,” Schmidt says.

Who Is the Target of the Executive Order?

Babies born after Feb. 19, 2025, to parents who do not have U.S. citizenship or permanent immigration status in the U.S. are the target of the executive order, should it stand. It is unclear how this would be enforced if the courts do ultimately allow it to stand.

“Anyone that is even on a visa that, in theory, could lead to a green card, like, say, an H-1B visa, which is a very common sort of skilled worker visa that is issued in the United States [would be vulnerable],” Lapinig says. “If at that point, they’re only put only on an H-1B and have not quite obtained legal permanent residents in the United States, then the executive order would consider their children, their babies, born to be ineligible for their birthright citizenship.”

Other visa holders, such as students, exchange visitors, tourists, athletes, and entertainers would also fall under this umbrella, as would Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) recipients, and people with humanitarian visas, among others.

Will the Supreme Court Weigh In or Let Lower Courts’ Decisions Stand and Effectively Rule the Executive Order Unconstitutional?

“This is the president of the United States declaring what at least takes the form of an authoritative interpretation of the Constitution. So simply the significance of who is making the claim and the significance of how much the claim would affect people does seem to indicate that allowing lower court decisions to do the work for the Supreme Court … it has always struck me as unlikely,” says Schmidt.

There is also likely a strategic reason the Supreme Court might want to take this case up. While the GOP-controlled court may give Trump some wins, like it did with the Trump immunity case last July, it’s likely “the court really wants to assert that it’s not just simply a rubber stamp for the Trump administration, and it wants to find opportunities to also assert its role in this whole process,” Schmidt says. “So therefore, it wants to find some Trump administration initiatives to strike down, and this has always struck me as easy pickings. The law is so clear, so well-established, and the impact of this on American society would be very disruptive, quite radical, quite harmful.”

“It is just head spinning, the amount of activity coming out of the executive branch that is constitutionally and legally questionable, and the burden that’s going to place on the courts,” Schmidt adds. “It’s a question about whether the courts are going to be spread so thin with these really major issues, and whether they want to be a little strategic about which cases they’re going to take on. … They might just allow the lower courts to take this one. I still don’t think that’s likely, but it is an option.”

Why It Matters.

Should Trump’s executive order be implemented as is, the policy would create an “underclass of individuals,” says Lapinig, which is something the drafters of the 14th Amendment worked to combat. “The 14th Amendment was truly an effort to make sure that slavery itself would not happen again in the United States, but also that nothing like slavery would happen again, as in that there would never be the creation and growth of an underclass of people in the United States that were denied off their race or ethnicity or ancestry, equal rights to others.”

“This executive order would create, dramatically, a large underclass of people in the United States that, in turn, would not be eligible for any public benefits, or [other] aspects of public support — and all Americans would be affected, because they are in your communities,” he adds. “The fabric of every community in the United States would be affected in some way because there would be the presence of folks who would unfortunately be part of this underclass of people. And so those communities would have to — whether on an individual level or on a community level — deal with the ramifications of children who are or who have been, who will be excluded from membership among the ranks of U.S. citizens.” Trending Stories Control, 'Freak-Offs,' Abuse: 7 Takeaways from Cassie's Testimony at Sean Combs Trial People Are Losing Loved Ones to AI-Fueled Spiritual Fantasies Halle Bailey Granted Restraining Order Against DDG, Claims He Abused Her Multiple Times 'Andor' Season 2 Finale: Finding the Cost of Freedom

As for the New Hampshire v. Trump lawsuit, which was filed hours after Trump signed the birthright citizenship executive order on his first day in office on Jan. 20, Judge Joseph Laplante issued a preliminary injunction on Feb. 10. On April 10, Trump and his administration filed a notice of appeal.

“We are very confident in our lawsuit, in the legal merits of our lawsuit, and our position that this executive order is completely and flagrantly unconstitutional,” Lapinig says. “We know that the law — has stood for as I mentioned over 120 years — is clearly on our side, and so we will just continue to litigate our lawsuit and do what we can to make sure that this executive order is never implemented.”"|"The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments over President Donald Trump’s executive order to end birthright citizenship on Thursday.

The fire is now contained to the original building, Baltimore City Fire Department spokesperson John Marsh said Tuesday, which is located near the intersection of Edmondson Avenue and North Bentalou Street.

There is still “deep-seated fire” in multiple locations, Marsh said, and around 50 firefighters continue to chase hot spots.

The cause of the fire has not yet been determined, and no injuries have been reported.

More than 225 firefighters responded to the seven-alarm fire Monday night at the multistory warehouse, which abuts train tracks used by MARC and Amtrak.

Light gray smoke still poured out of the building Tuesday morning as Baltimore City Fire Chief James Wallace and Mayor Brandon Scott stood near the scene.

The warehouse, Wallace said, is a “very large commercial structure,” with three to four stories above ground and two below. Firefighters have not been able to access the underground floors due to stability issues in the back of the building and near Amtrak, Wallace said.

Building engineers are working on a demolition plan.

“It’s going to take a lot of work,” Wallace said.

Wallace also said it has been years since the city has had a seven-alarm fire.

Video shared with WJZ showed flames spreading Monday night to nearby trees and thick, dark smoke obscuring the view of a red water tower on top of the warehouse. Aerial photos showed large plumes of smoke and crews working from multiple angles to hit the warehouse with water.

The fire started at the back right of the building, which is used to store mattresses. Wallace said Monday that the warehouse had two basement levels “stacked full” of mattresses.

About 30 nearby residents were asked to temporarily relocate because of concerns about smoke and radiant heat, and to give fire crews better access to the warehouse, though officials said it wasn’t an evacuation.

The American Red Cross of the National Capital & Greater Chesapeake Region is supporting residents who were asked to temporarily leave their homes in the 600 block of North Bentalou Street, a spokesperson said.

Residents from fifteen households will be temporarily housed by the city in a hotel, a spokesperson for the American Red Cross said in an email.

Several city agencies were involved in the response to this fire, Wallace said, with the Baltimore City Department of Transportation assisting with traffic and the MTA helping to bus residents to a nearby fire station.

Around 9:30 p.m., smoke was visible on Doppler radar, according to WJZ’s meteorologist Derek Beasley. The relatively light winds on Monday evening pushed the smoke plume north toward Druid Hill.

Beasley said the weather Monday evening likely worked in the fire crews’ favor, especially with rain in the forecast.

That’s a “huge difference” compared to what crews dealt with during the Camp Small fire at the end of 2024, where high winds fanned the flames of an inferno.

The Maryland Department of the Environment advised people to avoid the area and to leave or move indoors if they feel affected by the smoke.

The Maryland Transit Administration said service on the MARC Penn Line is canceled on Tuesday morning.

Amtrak train service between Wilmington, Delaware, and Washington, D.C., was paused but resumed Tuesday, though passengers were told to expect delays due to single tracking through the area.

Firefighters got word of an ignition just before 7 p.m.

The fire in West Baltimore happened the same day that a fire in downtown Baltimore injured two firefighters, one of them critically.

In rare cases, its maggots will eat your flesh|2025-05-13 00:00:00|"The U.S. has blocked imports of live cattle, horses, and bison through southern border ports following the resurgence in Mexico of the New World Screwworm, a parasitic fly that infects animals and threatens humans.

New World screwworm flies cause myiasis, an infection of flesh-eating maggots that burrow into the skin of living animals, causing serious and often fatal damage, Reuters reported.

The fly is named for how its maggots burrow, or screw, into an open wound using ""its sharp mouth hooks,"" according to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.

NWS has recently been detected “in remote farms with minimal cattle movement as far north as Oaxaca and Veracruz, about 700 miles away from the U.S. border,” the U.S. Department of Agriculture said in announcing the ban on Sunday.

New World Screwworm began resurgence in Central America

The parasites can infect livestock, wildlife, birds, pets, and, in some rare cases humans, the USDA says. The ban, which affects animals coming from and through Mexico, will continue on a month-by-month basis until the threat is contained, the department said.

NWS was eradicated in the U.S. in the 1960s, in Mexico in the 1970s, and much of Central America in the early 2000s, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

However, new cases were reported in October 2024 in Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Honduras, the CDC said. That sparked concern that the insects would spread north to the United States.

The first case in southern Mexico was reported to the United States in November, the USDA said.

While the United States and Mexico continue to work together to eradicate NWS in Mexico, “there has been unacceptable northward advancement of NWS and additional action must be taken to slow the northern progression of this deadly parasitic fly,” the USDA said.

What's so dangerous about the NWS?

NWS flies, about the size of a common housefly, lay eggs “on open wounds or other open parts of the body in live, warm-blooded animals,” according to the CDC. A wound as small as a tick bite can attract the flies.

The eggs hatch and become larvae, or maggots. They burrow into the wound to feed on the living flesh, the CDC says. That’s different from most other types of maggots that feed on decomposing flesh.

After they feed, the larvae fall to the ground and burrow into it. They later emerge as adult screwworm flies, the CDC says.

As you might expect, burrowing maggots in living creatures are highly painful.

What are the symptoms of NWS infection in humans?

NWS infestations are very painful, the USDA says. If you have an infestation, you may see maggots around or in an open wound, or your nose, eyes, or mouth. Symptoms can include:

◾Unexplained skin lesions (wounds or sores) that do not heal.

◾Skin wounds or sores that worsen over time.

◾Painful skin wounds or sores.

◾Bleeding from open sores.

◾Feeling larvae movement within a skin wound or sore, nose, mouth, or eyes.

◾Seeing maggots around or in open sores.

◾A foul-smelling odor from the site of the infestation.

A secondary bacterial infections sometimes occur and may cause fever or chills.

In animals, the symptoms include:

◾Irritated behavior.

◾Head shaking.

◾Smell of decay.

◾Evidence of a fly strike.

◾Presence of fly maggots in wounds.

What should you do if you get infected?

Maggots in a wound or a body part need to be removed by a medical professional, the CDC says. Don’t try to remove them yourself.

UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty is stepping down immediately from his role for “personal reasons,” the company announced Tuesday.

He will be replaced by Stephen Hemsley, the health insurer’s board chairman and former CEO from 2006 to 2017. Witty, who ran the health care giant for four years, will remain in a limited role as a senior adviser to Hemsley.

“We are grateful for Andrew’s stewardship of UnitedHealth Group, especially during some of the most challenging times any company has ever faced,” Hemsley said in a statement, adding the company has “greatly valued his leadership and compassion as chief executive and as a director and wish him and his family the best.”

Witty helped steer the company following the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson last year. UnitedHealthcare is a unit of the parent company that Witty helmed.

Thompson’s fatal shooting outside a New York hotel brought to light significant public outrage about the health insurance industry, with Witty publicly acknowledging in a New York Times essay that the US health system “is not perfect” and that coverage decisions “are not well understood.”

Witty also defended UnitedHealthcare, the company’s health insurance arm, though he acknowledged that it shares some of the responsibility for the lack of understanding about decisions on care.

Also on Tuesday, UnitedHealth Group (UNH) suspended financial outlook for the year because costs of Medicare Advantage “remained higher than expected.” The company expects to return to growth in 2026.

Last month in a call with analysts following its most recent earnings report, Witty said its “overall performance that was frankly unusual and unacceptable.” Shares that day fell more than 20%, its biggest single day drop in nearly three decades.

WASHINGTON — Microsoft began laying off nearly 3% of its entire workforce Tuesday, its largest mass layoff in more than two years.

The tech giant didn't disclose the total amount of lost jobs but it will amount to about 6,000 people. That includes 1,985 workers in its home state of Washington, according to a notice it sent to the state workforce agency Tuesday.

Microsoft employed 228,000 full-time workers as of last June, the last time it reported its annual headcount. About 55% of those workers were in the U.S.

Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, said the layoffs will be across all levels and geographies but the cuts will focus on reducing the number of managers. Notices to employees began going out on Tuesday.

Microsoft announced a smaller round of performance-based layoffs in January. But the 3% cuts will be Microsoft's biggest since early 2023, when the company cut 10,000 workers, almost 5% of its workforce, joining other tech companies that were scaling back their pandemic-era expansions.

The latest layoffs come just weeks after Microsoft reported strong sales and profits that beat Wall Street expectations for the January-March quarter, which investors took as a dose of relief during a turbulent time for the tech sector and U.S. economy.

Microsoft's chief financial officer, Amy Hood, said on an April earnings call that the company was focused on “building high-performing teams and increasing our agility by reducing layers with fewer managers.” She also said the headcount in March was 2% higher than a year earlier, and down slightly compared to the end of last year.

The layoffs are expected to hit across all parts of Microsoft's business, including the career networking site LinkedIn and the video game platform Xbox.

The company didn't give a specific reason for the layoffs, only that they were part of ""organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace.”

Microsoft has said it has been spending $80 billion in the fiscal year that ends in June on building data centers and other infrastructure it needs to develop to operate its artificial intelligence technology. Those AI tools have been pitched as changing the way people work, including in Microsoft's own workplaces.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg at an AI event last month at Meta's headquarters that “maybe 20, 30% of the code” for some of Microsoft's coding projects “are probably all written by software.”"|"The layoffs are expected to hit across all parts of Microsoft's business, including the career networking site LinkedIn and the video game platform Xbox.

On November 17, 2023, the board of OpenAI fired company CEO Sam Altman. His friend Chesky leapt into action—publicly defending his pal on X, getting on the phone with Microsoft’s CEO, and throwing himself into the thick of Altman’s battle to retake OpenAI. Five days later Altman prevailed, and Chesky—“I was so jacked up,” he says—turned his buzzing mind to his own company, Airbnb.

Thanksgiving weekend was beginning. The Chesky extended family had already held their turkey get-together a week earlier, and the Airbnb CEO had no holiday plan. He was completely alone in his sprawling San Francisco apartment except for Sophie, his golden retriever.

Still wired out of his mind from the cathartic corporate rescue, Chesky began to write. He wanted to bust the company he’d cofounded out of its pigeonhole of short-term home rentals. Amazon, he was fond of pointing out, was first an online bookstore before it became the everything store. Chesky had long believed that Airbnb should expand in a similar way. But things kept getting in the way—dealing with safety issues, fighting regulation, coping with the existential crisis of a global pandemic. The company was in danger of being tagged with the word that ambitious entrepreneurs dread like the plague: mature.

Now Chesky was emboldened to lay out his vision. Home rentals are simply a service, so why stop there? Airbnb could be the platform for booking all sorts of services. While other apps cover specific sectors—food delivery, home maintenance, car rides—Chesky figured that Airbnb’s experience in attractively displaying homes, vetting hosts, and responding to crises could make it more trustworthy than competitors and therefore the go-to option for virtually anything.

In a frantic typing spree at the dining room table, on the couch, the bed, and at times in his office, Chesky specced out how he would redesign the Airbnb app. Its users—now at 2 billion—would open up the app not only at vacation time but whenever they needed to find a portrait photographer, a personal trainer, or someone to cook their meals. Chesky reasoned that Airbnb would need to significantly strengthen its identity verification. He even thought he could get people to use the app as a credential, something as respected as a government-issued ID. If he could transform Airbnb into a storefront for real-world services, Chesky thought, he’d catapult his company from a nearly $10-billion-a-year business into one that boasted membership in tech’s pantheon.

Over the next few days, Chesky spilled these thoughts into an Evernote document. “I was basically going from room to room just pouring out this stream-of-consciousness manifesto, like Jack Kerouac writing On the Road,” he says, referring to the frenetically produced single roll of teletype paper that catalyzed the beat movement. “I dusted off all my ideas from 2012 to 2016,” Chesky tells me. “I basically said, ‘We’re not just a vacation app—we’re going to be a platform, a community.’” By Friday he had around 10,000 words, “incomprehensible to anyone but me.” He began to refine it, and by the time the weekend was over, Chesky had distilled his document down to 1,500 words."|"As Brian Chesky tells it, the reinvention of Airbnb started with the coup at OpenAI.

The service, which will be called ESPN, will live inside a completely redesigned ESPN app.

“As we explored options, we kept coming back to our four letters, ESPN,” said Jimmy Pitaro, who leads ESPN, during a press briefing in Disney’s New York office Tuesday morning, framing the decision as “simple, straightforward, clear.”

ESPN is also launching a promotional launch price of $29.99 for the bundle of all three services for the first 12 months. In connection with the launch, ESPN will rebrand ESPN+ as ESPN select, and will still cost $11.99.

The company is also offering an annual plan for $299.99, and a no-ads option (for Disney+ and Hulu) for $44.99 per month.

Pitaro says that subscribers to pay TV bundles with access to ESPN will have access to the streaming service, reiterating that the company is “largely platform agnostic.”

“We are ultimately going to judge ourselves based on the totality of people subscribing to ESPN,” Pitaro added. “We’re very happy with the traditional world, the traditional ecosystem. We’ve done a lot to protect that ecosystem, and we will continue to make the traditional ecosystem a priority.”

He added that in Disney’s conversations with its distribution partners, it has been “open book” about the streaming plans, seeking to ensure seamless access for pay-TV customers.

The company also said that Rich Eisen would return to the company, bringing his Rich Eisen Show to both Disney+ and ESPN. Beyond that, ESPN confirmed that it will include ESPN’s full suite of live sports and studio shows, with the company also set to unveil other partners in the coming months.

Other programing news will likely come ahead of the fall launch, though Pitaro teased a few other priorities for the company: A desire to cut deals with leagues for regional sports networks, which the company could offer as an upsell, and finding ways to utilize AI in the tech stack.

“We are very much focused on on AI, and are working with some of our key talent right now, getting them on board with this idea that having the storytelling being driven by AI,” Pitaro said."|"ESPN pulled back the curtain on its long-awaited direct-to-consumer streaming service Tuesday, planning a fall launch at $29.99 per month, or $35.99 for a bundle that will include Disney+ and Hulu.

On Monday evening, there were as few as three air traffic controllers at a Philadelphia radar center scheduled each hour to guide planes that were flying into and out of Newark Liberty International Airport, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.

That's despite a target of 14 air traffic controllers for that time period, per an agreement between the FAA and the air traffic controllers union, The New York Times reported. NPR has not independently confirmed that report. The FAA did not reply to NPR's question about the agreement, and the union did not reply to multiple requests to comment.

Sponsor Message

In an emailed statement to NPR, FAA spokesperson Rick Breitenfeldt said ""at least three controllers were scheduled for each hour"" at the Philadelphia facility that manages air traffic at Newark on Monday night.

""We plan for staffing with traffic management initiatives to ensure safety is never compromised,"" Breitenfeldt added.

Monday night's slim staffing came as the FAA struggles to keep air travel flowing smoothly through one of the busiest airports in the country, where technological troubles, a worker shortage and ongoing runway construction have hampered operations in recent weeks.

To address these challenges, the FAA has slowed arrivals and departures at Newark , leading to scores of cancellations and delays for frustrated fliers.

""If we reduce the number of flights at Newark, we're not doing it to annoy people. We're not doing it to delay people's travel. What we're doing is guaranteeing safety,"" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a Monday press conference.

While air traffic controllers in an airport's tower handle flight traffic within a few-mile radius where it is often visible to the eye, the Terminal Radar Approach Control — or TRACON — directs incoming and outgoing planes that are further away from an airport.

Management of flight traffic at Newark was moved from Long Island to Philadelphia last summer. (Duffy said the Biden administration ""bungled"" the relocation and didn't address technical problems that arose in the fall.)

The part of the Philadelphia facility controlling Newark airspace has 22 fully certified controllers and five fully certified supervisors, the FAA said in a separate statement Tuesday. There are also 21 controllers and supervisors in training — 10 of whom are receiving on-the-job training and are certified in at least one position, which means they can work without supervision from an instructor.

Sponsor Message

The agency also emphasized that the U.S. is facing a national shortage of air traffic controllers and said staffing goals for Newark's airspace have not been met for years.

The low staff levels at Newark have worried some travelers, but a shortage of controllers alone would not likely pose a threat to passenger safety, says John Hansman, a professor of aeronautics and astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

""We run the system very conservatively and very safely,"" Hansman said. In most cases, an insufficient number of air traffic controllers just means a slowdown in traffic, he said.

""If you get to this very extreme case we appear to be in, then you have secondary concerns about fatigue and stress, et cetera, that may degrade performance, but I don't think we've necessarily seen that at this point,"" Hansman added.

Brief communications outages in Philadelphia in late April and early May hampered operations in Newark. After the first incident, several air traffic controllers took time off in response to the stress and trauma they experienced, NPR previously reported.

Another telecommunications issue in Philadelphia on Sunday briefly slowed traffic at Newark, but Duffy said a Friday evening software update successfully kept a redundant communications line functioning and prevented a full-blown outage.

Duffy has called the national air traffic control system ""antiquated"" and last week announced a plan to overhaul it."|"As few as 3 radar controllers monitored Newark's airspace Monday night, FAA saystoggle caption Andres Kudacki/Getty ImagesOn Monday evening, there were as few as three air traffic controllers at a Philadelphia radar center scheduled each hour to guide planes that were flying into and out of Newark Liberty International Airport, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.

172|https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/13/business/stock-market-dow|Stocks just erased all of this year’s losses as investors welcome trade progress|2025-05-13 00:00:00|"CNN —

The S&P 500 benchmark stock index hit another milestone in its remarkable march higher from the brink of a bear market in recent weeks: It has now erased all its losses for this year.

US stocks were mixed Tuesday as investors digested cooling inflation data and easing trade tensions between the United States and China. The Dow closed lower by 270 points, or 0.64%. Meanwhile, the broader S&P 500 rose 0.72% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 1.61%.

For the year, the Dow is still down 0.95% and the Nasdaq Composite is down 1.56% this year.

Wall Street got a major boost on Monday after Washington and Beijing brokered an agreement to substantially lower tariffs for 90 days. Stocks rose further on Tuesday as new data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed a surprising cooldown in annual inflation ahead of the impact of Trump’s tariffs. Consumer prices in April recorded their lowest annual increase since February 2021.

Stocks have been on a tear for the past month after Trump began to change his tune on tariffs, announcing carve-outs for some tariffs on China and the prospect of inking some trade deals.

“Fears of slowing growth and a recession caused by punitive tariffs drove markets lower in the first week of April, but they’ve rebounded on the heels of a tariff pause and a Chinese trade breakthrough, and now a better-than-expected inflation report removes the last big overhang for the market,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Northlight Asset Management, in a Tuesday note.

Nvidia (NVDA) surged 5.63% Tuesday after the chip giant announced it would partner with Saudi Arabia on artificial intelligence initiatives.

The initiative involves a partnership with Synchron, a neurotechnology startup that produces an implantable brain-computer interface (BCI) device called the Stentrode. The Stentrode enables users with severe motor impairments, such as those caused by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), to control Apple devices using neural signals detected from within blood vessels located above the brain's motor cortex.

The Stentrode is implanted through the jugular vein and rests inside a blood vessel on the surface of the brain. The device contains 16 electrodes that can detect motor-related brain activity without requiring open-brain surgery. These neural signals are then translated into digital commands that allow users to interact with an interface.

Synchron has implanted the Stentrode in ten patients since 2019 under the FDA's investigational device exemption. One test participant based in Pennsylvania with ALS, who cannot use his arms or hands, is able to use the Apple Vision Pro and other Apple devices through thought alone, although it is slower than conventional input mechanisms.

In 2014, Apple introduced the ""Made for iPhone"" hearing aid protocol as a Bluetooth standard that enables seamless wireless communication between hearing aids and Apple devices. The company is now apparently pursuing a similar approach with brain-computer interfaces, aiming to establish a dedicated industry standard in collaboration with Synchron.

Apple is apparently planning to add support for BCIs into its existing Switch Control accessibility framework, which allows input from non-standard devices such as joysticks and adaptive hardware. The company reportedly intends to release this new standard later in 2025.

Synchron's approach differs significantly from that of other companies such as Neuralink, which is developing a more invasive implant called the N1. Neuralink's device contains more than 1,000 electrodes embedded directly into brain tissue, providing a higher-resolution neural data stream. This allows for more complex control, including moving a cursor across a screen and typing using mental intention.

An executive order Monday from President Donald Trump said the tariffs on low-value parcels originating from China and coming through the U.S. Postal Service will be lowered to 54%, down from 120%.

It also says a per-package flat rate — as an alternative to the value-based tariff — will be kept at $100, rather than being raised to $200 on June 1 as previously decreed. Packages shipped by commercial carriers are subject to the general tariff, which also has been cut.

The new rules go into effect Wednesday.

They are part of a broader agreement by the Trump administration to drastically lower import taxes on all Chinese goods from 145% to 30% following weekend talks in Switzerland with Chinese officials. China issued a public notice on Tuesday lowering its own tariffs on U.S. goods to 10%, down from 125%.

However, the reductions are temporary, allowing the two sides to negotiate a longer-term deal in the next 90 days.

Izzy Rosenzweig, founder and CEO of the logistic company Portless, said U.S. brands are “very excited” about the broader tariff cut. The import tax is still high, but not as prohibitive as when it was 145%, which amounted to a trade embargo.

On the low-value shipments, online purchases had been coming into the U.S. duty-free for several years under the de minimis rule, which exempted them from the import tax.

Popular shopping sites such as Shein and Temu that offer ultra-low prices took advantage of the duty-free rule by shipping directly from China to U.S. buyers, bypassing more cumbersome customs paperwork.

President Donald Trump terminated the exemption on such parcels originating from China and Hong Kong on May 2, following criticism that it not only resulted in lost tariff revenue but also allowed illicit drugs and unsafe products to flow into the U.S. without adequate scrutiny.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection said as many as 4 million low-value parcels were coming into the U.S. every day — many of which originated from China.

Shortly before the exemption ended on May 2, prices on many items sold by Shein rose. Temu apparently halted shipments from China and tapped its existing inventory in the U.S.

John Lash, group vice president of product strategy at the supply chain platform e2open, said he expected the volume of low-value packages would now rise but not back to previous levels. The $100 flat rate, he said, means that higher-value packages could get less of a hit, because the effective duty rate could be as low as 13%.

Neither Shein nor Temu immediately responded to requests for comment Tuesday about the lower tariffs."|"An executive order Monday from President Donald Trump said the tariffs on low-value parcels originating from China and coming through the U.S.

NEW JERSEY (WABC) -- Agencies across the area are preparing for a possible New Jersey Transit strike on Friday that could cause big problems for commuters.

The union that represents the engineers who drive the trains is threatening to walk off the job as soon as Friday if a contract deal is not reached.

It would be the first transit strike in 42 years and potentially impact 350,000 people.

Governor Phil Murphy said the state is preparing for the worst but hoping for the best as the deadline nears.

""I'm hoping and praying that they can find the common ground to avoid a strike,"" Murphy said.

Talks have been underway in Washington, D.C. between the Brotherhood of Local Engineers and Trainmen and the head of New Jersey Transit.

Monday's negotiations were called productive, with the only major sticking point being wages for the 450 members of the union.

The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey announced the following guidance in the event of a suspension of NJ Transit rail service.

Here are the alternate routes passengers need to know:

Midtown Bus Terminal

NJ TRANSIT has provided a rail service disruption plan that includes supplemental bus service to the Midtown Bus Terminal.

Some private commuter carriers are planning to add or modify service to accommodate additional passengers.

As a precaution, some carriers will be moving temporarily to provide space for additional NJ TRANSIT bus arrivals and departures.

Passengers should review bus departure gates carefully.

Beginning Monday, May 12, all Trailways departures will depart out of gates 64-68 on the lower level of the north wing.

The Lincoln Tunnel's Exclusive Bus Lane, currently in effect weekdays beginning at 6 a.m., will have expanded hours if needed.

Expect crowded conditions during peak hours in the bus terminal as NJ TRANSIT has limited capacity to accommodate displaced rail passengers by bus.

Passengers should allow extra travel time.

The Port Authority will be providing additional staff to assist with passenger navigation and crowd management.

PATH Commuter Rail

On weekdays, PATH service will operate on a normal schedule.

As always, PATH will monitor stations and add service as necessary to address any unsafe crowding conditions.

During peak hours customers could experience temporary crowding conditions.

Those who do not need to ride during peak hours are urged to avoid the system during that time.

Additional PATH staff will be available to assist with passenger navigation and crowd management.

Existing mass transit to/from Newark Liberty International Airport:

In the event of a suspension of NJ TRANSIT rail service, NJ TRANSIT trains will not serve the Newark Liberty International Airport rail station.

Select Amtrak trains will continue to serve the station. Passengers will need an Amtrak ticket to board an Amtrak train. AirTrain Newark will continue operating to/from the Airport Train Station for Amtrak passengers.

Travelers are urged to make use of bus lines serving Newark Liberty International Airport. Those include NJ TRANSIT buses GO 28 (Bloomfield-Newark), 37 (Maplewood-Irvington-Newark), 62 (Newark-Elizabeth), 67 (Ocean-Monmouth-Middlesex-Newark), and Coach USA express service to/from Manhattan.

Drivers should allow additional travel time and expect crowded conditions on airport roadways.

New travel option provided by the Port Authority between Newark-Penn Station and Newark Liberty International Airport:

UPDATE: Beginning May 16, the Port Authority will operate free, direct shuttle bus service between Newark-Penn Station and AirTrain Newark's P4 station every 20 minutes. The free shuttle buses will not operate between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m., traditionally when NJ TRANSIT does not operate rail service. Travelers should allow additional travel time and expect crowded conditions on buses and at stations

Additional Port Authority staff will be available to assist with passenger navigation and crowd management at Newark-Penn Station and the airport.

Getting to Newark Airport from Newark-Penn Station:

UPDATE: At Newark-Penn Station, passengers should follow signs and staff direction to the pickup/drop-off point at Raymond Plaza West. The shuttle bus will travel directly to AirTrain Newark's P4 station. There, travelers can board AirTrain Newark to access all airport terminals.

Getting from Newark Airport to Newark-Penn Station:

Take AirTrain Newark to the P4 Station. There, travelers should proceed to the ground level and follow the direction of Port Authority staff to the shuttle bus pickup/drop-off point. The shuttle bus will travel directly to Newark-Penn Station.

Chime had reportedly filed confidential S-1 paperwork back in December.

S-1 filings typically reveal all kinds of information, covering financial, legal, and other risk factors. But Chime’s S-1 documents still have a lot of blank spaces. We don’t know how many shares it hopes to sell or at what price. Chime could be aiming to raise $1 billion, IPO specialist Renaissance Capital believes.

We also don’t know how many shares insiders plan to sell as part of the IPO. This includes its major backers, a list that includes billionaire Yuri Milner’s DST Global, Michael Stark’s Crosslink Capital, billionaire Len Blavatnik’s Access Industries, as well as VC firms General Atlantic, Menlo Ventures (led by board member Shawn Carolan), the Sino French Innovation Fund, and Iconiq, according to the paperwork.

Chime raised $2.65 billion total as a private company, including its last raise in 2021 that valued it at $25 billion, PitchBook estimates. As a result, there are many more VCs on its cap table. They, too, could be in for big paydays. For instance, Kirsten Green’s Forerunner Ventures and Hunter Walk’s Homebrew both claim Chime as a portfolio company.

Chime offered one detail that suggests the company believes it will be a huge IPO. Chime enlisted an army of big name investment bankers, including Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and JP Morgan.

The financials show why investors may grow excited. The company finished 2024 with $1.67 billion in revenue and $25 million in losses, compared to nearly $1.3 billion in revenue and $203 million in losses in 2023. Its 2025 first-quarter revenue was already $519 million. So, by Silicon Valley math, that puts it on track for $2 billion this year and near profitability.

Chime offers consumer checking, savings, debit, and credit cards and claims 8.6 million active users.

One interesting reveal in the paperwork. Its board member Cynthia Marshall served as the CEO of the Dallas Mavericks from 2018 to December 2024. Chime became a Mavericks sponsor during that time. It paid around $33 million over three years (2022-2024), which gained it the Chime logo on the team’s jersey, among other marketing benefits.

In a statement published on its website, State Farm said that the insurer remains “deeply concerned about the financial position of State Farm General” — the insurer’s California subsidiary — “as it is difficult to match price to risk in California.” The statement further pointed to the decision by S&P Global Ratings on Tuesday to downgrade the California State Farm subsidiary from an “AA” to an “A+” rating, a move attributed in part to “a significant deterioration” in the company’s capital position over the last five years.

During the recent hearing in California and in the process that ensued, State Farm was forced to make some concessions — lowering the rate hike to 17 percent, from nearly 22 percent, as well as requiring State Farm’s parent company to provide an infusion of $400 million in cash to its California affiliate. For years, advocates for policyholders have argued that the way in which insurers have organized themselves — with major national companies like State Farm having both a national company and a California subsidiary — protects the insurer but not the customer.

The higher rate comes after survivors of the Eaton fire in the working-class community of Altadena organized, first on a WhatsApp group dedicated to pickleball and later on Discord, a platform better known for gaming.

Federal tax credits that benefit energy developers, manufacturers and utilities face an early phaseout in a budget proposal released Monday by a key GOP-controlled House committee.

The House Ways and Means Committee’s draft reconciliation package steps down the investment and production tax credits for nuclear power, wind, solar, batteries, geothermal and other clean energy technologies after 2028, and eliminates them completely after 2031. It preserves a comparatively generous credit for carbon sequestration and extends the clean fuels production credit.

Energy industry groups and customers slammed the proposal, saying it would raise electricity prices, quash a manufacturing boom spurred by the Inflation Reduction Act and erode the United States’ competitive advantage on artificial intelligence.

Dive Insight:

The Ways and Means budget gives clean energy developers and producers until 2028 to claim the full 45Y and 48E tax credits for clean energy investment and production. The credit values step down to 80% in 2029, 60% in 2030 and 40% in 2031 before zeroing out in 2032. A separate credit for nuclear power production would phase out on the same schedule.

As originally passed, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 allowed taxpayers to claim the full value of all three credits into 2032.

“While our industry is ready to engage constructively and find a workable path forward, the Committee’s approach simply goes too far too fast,” American Clean Power Association CEO Jason Grumet said in a statement. “With energy demand surging, this is not the time for disruption.”

The Ways and Means proposal also tightens eligibility for 45Y and 48E by requiring projects to be “placed in service” to qualify for the credit. The Inflation Reduction Act based eligibility on the year projects began construction, a more generous framework in a world where the timeline for grid interconnection and long-lead electrical equipment can stretch for years.

The placed-in-service requirement “severely crimps utility scale renewables” to the point that “the only projects that will get the full ITC and PTC are those already in the queue,” Advait Arun, senior associate for energy finance at the Center for Public Enterprise, said in an interview.

Clean energy advocates warned that the Ways and Means budget could disproportionately harm the “clean firm” technologies President Trump and House Republicans seem to favor, like advanced nuclear and geothermal.

“Some of America’s largest companies are attempting to advance critical new technologies like geothermal and advanced nuclear energy, but those technologies will not move forward if these tax credits are phased out,” Clean Energy Buyers Association CEO Rich Powell said in a statement. Powell’s organization represents major technology and industrial firms driving demand for clean electricity, such as Microsoft and Amazon.

A key nuclear power trade group whose April 30 plea to preserve key IRA tax credits attracted more than 100 signatories earlier this month said the Ways and Means budget would set back an industry critical to U.S. national security.

“Underlying conditions in the market have not changed and nuclear energy is not appropriately valued for its ability to provide reliable, secure, and affordable energy to an increasingly clean electric grid,” Michael Flannigan, vice president of governmental affairs at the Nuclear Energy Institute, said in a statement.

An early end to clean energy tax credits would compound the impacts of downsizing at the Department of Energy, particularly in the DOE Loan Programs Office and Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Arun said.

“If those [programs] are all going in the can, it will have just as much of an impact on the emerging technology landscape” as any changes to the tax code, he said.

A proposed two-year sunset of the IRA’s tax credit transferability mechanism could further curtail clean energy investment, Arun said. The IRA created a new pathway for project developers and asset owners with limited tax liability to raise capital by transferring tax credits — at a discount dependent in part on the deal’s perceived risk — to third-party buyers with greater tax liability.

The change would affect small and midsize clean energy developers the most, putting them at a disadvantage to incumbents closer to the big banks that dominate the more complex, gated world of traditional tax equity finance and have limited capacity to take on new clients, Arun said.

“Transferability is the biggest new development in clean energy markets … to shut that down will dry up a lot of the liquidity clean energy developers have been counting on,” he said.

On an earnings call last week, before Ways and Means released its draft budget, Sunrun Chief Financial Officer Danny Abajian said his distributed energy company would have to temporarily “[shift] how we source capital” were transferability repealed. But he said Sunrun could eventually benefit from a “flight to quality” in a tighter tax credit market.

Crux, an energy capital markets platform that has emerged as a key player in the nascent transferability industry, said in a subscriber email Monday that the Ways and Means proposal “is just the starting point and we anticipate that the final bill will take a more favorable stance on transferability and tax credits.”

Though both are subject to new restrictions on transferability and foreign ownership, the Ways and Means proposal treats the 45Q tax credit for carbon capture and sequestration and the 45Z credit for clean fuels production more favorably than the technology-neutral credits. The proposal maintains 45Q through 2032 and extends the 45Z credit through 2031, giving producers of biofuels like ethanol and sustainable aviation fuel four more years to claim it.

Hydrogen producers are not so lucky. The Ways and Means proposal eliminates the 45V credit for clean hydrogen production after this year, less than 12 months after the Treasury Department released final guidance.

Most of the popular consumer and builder tax credits for efficient home appliances, solar panels, electric vehicles and EV chargers are also set to wind down this year. Credits for electric and other clean-fuel fleet vehicles end after this year as well, with a seven-year grace period for orders covered by existing contracts."|"Dive Brief:Federal tax credits that benefit energy developers, manufacturers and utilities face an early phaseout in a budget proposal released Monday by a key GOP-controlled House committee.

Many people saw the no-frills vehicle, with an easy-to-repair body and nostalgic hand crank windows, as a refreshing antidote to today’s overstuffed and increasingly unaffordable cars.

How unaffordable? Average monthly payments on new cars have soared to $739 in March from $537 in January 2019, according to Cox Automotive. The average new car costs $47,400, with electric models around $59,200. High interest rates, now around 9.4 percent for a 72-month loan, have made cars even more of a financial stretch.

“Prices and interest rates are both high and stuck,” said Mark Schirmer, director of industry insights for Cox Automotive. “If you haven’t been in the market since 2018, it’s got to be shocking what a car costs.”

President Trump’s tariffs of 25 percent on imported cars and parts have consumers scrambling to buy before prices rise even more. Cars that cost less than $30,000 are especially vulnerable — nearly 80 percent of those are subject to tariffs. They include consumer staples like the American-made Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla, which rely on imported parts. Supplies of budget models are expected to shrink, and automakers may stop importing certain models entirely."|"When Slate Auto, a start-up, unveiled a roughly $25,000 electric pickup truck last month, social media lit up with comments.

May 13 (UPI) -- Japanese automaker Nissan said Tuesday it will shutter seven plants and cut thousands of additional jobs in a second round of job cuts after yielding millions of dollars in profit losses last year.

The shake-up cuts Nissan's global workforce by a total of 20,000 and will reduce its number of its factories from 17 to 10 by 2027.

""The decision (to reduce the workforce), of course, was not easy,"" said Nissan Motor Co. CEO Ivan Espinosa.

Officials said it will impact Nissan staff and contractor roles across its manufacturing, sales, admin, research and development divisions as it grappled with poor sales in China and the United States and a decreased consolidated operating profit of $2.78 billion to $300 million.

""In the face of challenging full-year 2024 performance and rising variable costs compounded by an uncertain environment,"" Espinosa said, adding Nissan ""must prioritize self-improvement with greater urgency and speed, aiming for profitability that relies less on volume.""

However, Nissan officials did not indicate which of is plants will close.

This latest round of cuts includes the thousands of global job cuts announced by the company in November and brings it to a collective 15% reduction.

Nissan announced it will cut 9,000 jobs and reduce manufacturing capacity by 20% on top of a 50% monthly pay cut for Nissan executives as it pointed to its ""severe"" financial ""situation"" while the company aims to return to profitability by fiscal year 2026.

""Unfortunately, as you have seen the results, the size of the company is just not sustainable,"" said Espinosa. ""And if we don't do something now, the problem will just get worse.""

By December, Nissan was on track to create the world's third-largest auto group with rival Honda by 2026 in a deal that broke down after mega-merger negotiations failed in February for Nissan to be Honda's subsidiary company.

Meanwhile, the impact of sweeping tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump tarnished Nissan's outlook with it no longer providing guidance for its income and operating profits for 2025 through March 2026 due to ongoing uncertainty over American tariff policy.

Espinosa, who took over the CEO job on April 1, said he hopes for ""stability and clarity"" on tariffs while Japan negotiates with the United States.

""It's very difficult to plan in the current volatility,"" he stated."|"On Tuesday, Nissan said it will cut an additional 11,000 jobs globally to bring to around 20,000 job cuts since a first round was announced in November.

Coinbase (COIN) shares skyrocketed on Tuesday following news the cryptocurrency exchange will be added to the S&P 500.

Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in U.S., will replace Discover Financial Services (DFS) in the benchmark index before trading opens next Monday, marking a major milestone for the company, which went public in April 2021.

The inclusion comes less than a week after the company said that it had agreed to acquire Deribit, a crypto options exchange, for $2.9 billion in cash and stock, the same day it posted first-quarter earnings that came in below Wall Street expectations.

Coinbase shares jumped 24% on Tuesday to close at around $257. With that move, the stock has inched into positive territory for 2025, rebounding from an early-April low of around $142.

Below, we break down the technicals on the Coinbase chart and point out key price levels that investors will likely be watching.

Inverse Head and Shoulders Pattern Breakout

Coinbase shares forged an inverse head and shoulders pattern on the chart between March and May, with the price staging a decisive breakout above the formation’s neckline on Tuesday.

Even before today's rally, the stock had registered higher-than-average volume over the previous three trading sessions, indicating that larger market participants had accumulated shares in preparation for a significant price move.

Let’s identify key overhead areas on the Coinbase chart to watch amid the potential for further upside and also locate a major support level worth monitoring during possible declines.

Key Overhead Areas to Watch

The $245 level was a key area to watch coming into Tuesday's session as it was near two closely aligned troughs that formed on the chart in December and January.

With that level comfortably surpassed, shares could climb to the $273 level. Investors who have bought at lower prices may look to place sell orders in this region near a horizontal line the connects a range of peaks and troughs on the chart extending back to March last year.

This level also corresponds with a measured move price target that calculates the depth of the inverse head and shoulders pattern in points and adds that amount to the formation’s neckline. For example, adding $65 to $208 projects a target of $273.

A more-bullish move higher may trigger a rally toward $330. This area on the chart could provide selling pressure near several peaks that developed on the chart just below the stock’s December high.

Major Support Level Worth Monitoring

During retracements in Coinbase shares, investors should monitor the $208 level. This location on the chart would likely attract buying interest on a retest of the inverse head and shoulders’ neckline, which may turn into a major support area after Tuesday’s breakout.

WASHINGTON — Thousands of eye care products, including lubricant eye drops and artificial tears, have been voluntarily recalled due to a ""manufacturing deviation"" found following a U.S. Food and Drug Administration audit.

AvKARE, a pharmaceutical distributor, said it was notified of the consumer level drug recall by St. Louis-based BRS Analytical Service, LLC for five over-the-counter eye care products. In a urgent notice about the voluntary recall, the company said that the health risk to consumers is unknown, but the ""manufacturing deviations"" may lead to ""products of unacceptable quality, and it is not possible to rule out patient risks resulting from these products.""

Consumers who have the recalled products are urged to cease use immediately. AvKARE also asks consumers with these products to fill out a recall form on its website and fax the completed form to 931-292-6229 or email it to customerservice@avkare.com. The company will send a Return Authorization Form for consumers to ship the recalled products back to the pharmaceutical distributor and issue full credit, including shipping costs for returns.

The company even claims this new type of battery pack could lower the cost of its electric SUVs so they're comparable to their gasoline counterparts.

The news came today as GM has announced it will use lithium manganese-rich (LMR) battery cells in its largest electric vehicles, the full-size trucks and SUVs sold by Chevrolet, GMC, and Cadillac. They are to be produced by Ultium Cells, its joint-venture battery company with LG Energy Solutions. The first such cells will come from a pilot line in 2027, with full volume production in 2028 at a plant it hasn’t disclosed.

The new cells are in the prismatic format, versus Ultium’s current pouch cells, which use a nickel-cobalt-manganese-aluminum chemistry. Those cells, in large standardized modules, power GM’s entire current EV lineup, from the compact Chevrolet Equinox EV up to the GMC Hummer EV.

The new prismatic cells appear even larger than Ultium’s pouch cells, though GM did not provide dimensions. They will be housed in modules that, overall, have 50 percent fewer parts than their predecessors. That may prevent delays like those that delayed volume production of its Ultium modules by 12 to 18 months, pushing deliveries of several models from late 2022 to early 2024.

Lower Cost, Higher Energy Density

Crucially, GM claims its Ultium battery engineers have created a chemistry that provides one-third greater energy density than comparable lithium iron-phosphate (LFP)—at a comparable cell cost. China owns virtually all the intellectual property around LFP chemistry, which costs less in materials than NMCA because it uses none of those metals. The trade-off for lower cost is lower energy density by volume."|"The news came today as GM has announced it will use lithium manganese-rich (LMR) battery cells in its largest electric vehicles, the full-size trucks and SUVs sold by Chevrolet, GMC, and Cadillac.

During Tuesday's airing of The Android Show: I/O Edition, the company said its family of AI models would soon power the conversational experiences on Android Auto, Wear OS, Google TV and beyond. I know what you're thinking: don’t those platforms already come with Google Assistant? They do, but Google is promising Gemini will make every device it comes to more conversational.

For instance, once Gemini arrives on Wear OS, Google says you won't need to get the wording of your request just right for the software to understand you. Instead, you can say something like ""Remember I’m using locker 43 today,"" and Gemini will know to set a reminder for you. Google is promising similar enhancements on Android Auto, where Google Assistant has been an important part of the experience for years.

""Soon, Gemini will upgrade that experience by understanding what you want while you're driving, through natural conversations,"" the company says. ""So instead of focusing on the perfect prompt or tapping the right button, you can stay focused on the road ahead.""

In practice, that means Gemini will be able to do things like summarize text messages for you and translate them into more than 40 languages. With its ability to ""remember"" things, you can do things like tell Gemini to always send messages to a specific friend in Spanish, even though you might not speak the language. Google will start rolling out Gemini to Android Auto in the coming months, with cars with Google built-in to follow later this year.

Elsewhere, Google is building Android XR from the ground up with Gemini built-in. ""When the first headset from Samsung launches later this year, Gemini can help you do things like plan a vacation by surrounding you with videos, maps and local tips, creating an entire itinerary in minutes while providing a more realistic feel for the place you're researching,"" the company says.

In the coming months, Google will also bring Gemini to Google TV. As you can probably guess, here Gemini will augment recommendations. Specifically, you can expect better age-appropriate suggestions for your kids. The model will also give Google TV the capability to answer any questions your children might have about what they're watching.

Last but not least, Google says Sony and Samsung will bring Gemini to some of the new earbuds the two companies plan to release this year and into the future. No details yet on what to expect there, but like on Wear OS and Android Auto, presumably the addition of Gemini will help make those earbuds better at understanding what you say to them.

During its pre-taped Android Show stream on May 13, Google announced its latest Material 3 Expressive design language, the expansion of Gemini AI to Wear OS and Android Auto and enhanced security features for its mobile operating system. The search giant will be following up with more AI announcements at its Google I/O 2025 developer conference, which runs from May 20 to May 23."|"During Tuesday's airing of The Android Show: I/O Edition, the company said its family of AI models would soon power the conversational experiences on Android Auto, Wear OS, Google TV and beyond.

190|https://www.wired.com/story/google-advanced-protection-vulnerable-users-lockdown-android-16/|Google’s Advanced Protection for Vulnerable Users Comes to Android|2025-05-13 18:33:06.968000+00:00|"With the rise of mercenary spyware and other targeted threats, tech giants like Apple, Google, and Microsoft have spent the last few years trying to figure out how to protect the digital lives of their most at-risk, vulnerable users around the world. On mobile, the launch of Apple's iOS Lockdown Mode in 2022 was one concerted effort to shed nonessential functionality in favor of maximum security—a trade-off most users wouldn't want to make, but that could be very worth it for a public figure, activist, journalist, or dissident living under daily scrutiny and threat of attack. For years, Google has offered a program for a similar demographic called Advanced Protection that focuses on adding additional layers of monitoring and security to vulnerable users' Google accounts, a core piece of many people's digital lives that could be devastating if compromised. Now, Google is extending Advanced Protection with a suite of features for Android 16.

On Tuesday, the company announced an Advanced Protection mode for phones running the newest version of Android. At its core, the mode is designed around imposing strong security settings on all apps and services to silo data as much as possible and reduce interactions with unsecured web services and previously unknown, untrusted individuals. Advanced Protection on Android is meant to be as usable and flexible as possible, though, leaning on Google's rapidly expanding on-device AI scanning capabilities to provide monitoring and alerts without having to completely eliminate features. Still, the mode imposes restrictions that can't be turned off, like blocking phones from connecting to historic 2G data networks and disabling Chrome's Javascript optimizer, which could alter or break some web functionality on some sites.

“There are two classes of things that we use to defend the user. One is you obviously harden the system, so you try to lock things down, you prevent many forms of attacks,"" says Dave Kleidermacher, vice president of engineering at Android’s security and privacy division. ""But two is you can't always prevent every attack entirely. But if you can detect that you've been compromised, you can take some sort of corrective action. In consumer security on mobile this detection has never really been a possibility, so that's one of the big things we've done here.""

This monitoring and detection capability, known as Intrusion Logging, uses end-to-end encryption to indelibly store logs from your device in the cloud such that they can't be accessed by Google or any party aside from you, but also in a form that can't be deleted or modified, even if your device and Google account are compromised.

Logging and system monitoring tools are common on laptops and desktops—not to mention in enterprise IT environments—but offering the capabilities for consumers on mobile devices is more unusual. As with any scheme that takes data off a device and puts it in the cloud, the system does introduce some new risks, but Google and Google Cloud Services already run many end-to-end encrypted platforms for users, and Kleidermacher notes that the ability to create indelible logs that can't be manipulated or deleted by a sophisticated attacker is invaluable in addressing targeted attacks.

“The main innovation here is you have an audit log mechanism to detect compromise that is actually resistant to device tampering,” he says. “It's bringing intrusion detection to the consumer. So if you as a consumer suspect a problem and you're not sure, you can pull the logs down from the cloud. You can share them with a security expert, you can share them with an NGO, and they can use tools for analysis.”

Another feature that is on by default and can't be turned off in Advanced Protection is Android's Memory Tagging Extension (MTE). The feature, which debuted for Google's Pixel line and is starting to be adopted in processors on other devices, is a hardware security protection related to how a system manages its memory. If an attacker attempts to exploit a memory vulnerability such as a so-called buffer overflow, MTE will cause the process to fail, stopping the attack in its tracks. Memory corruption bugs are a common tool used by hackers, so neutering the entire class of vulnerabilities makes it much more difficult to attack a device."|"For years, Google has offered a program for a similar demographic called Advanced Protection that focuses on adding additional layers of monitoring and security to vulnerable users' Google accounts, a core piece of many people's digital lives that could be devastating if compromised.

For instance, if your static photo features a sky, clouds, and the ocean, TikTok could turn the photo into a video where the sky gradually shifts hues, the clouds start to drift, and you hear the sound of waves crashing. Or, you could animate a group selfie that highlights gestures and expressions.

The launch of the new image-to-video features comes a few years after TikTok introduced an in-app text-to-image AI generator. While both Instagram and Snapchat also offer text-to-image AI features for creators, TikTok is now taking a step further by offering its users the ability to create videos from images. It’s worth noting that Snapchat has said it will soon allow creators to generate AI videos from images.

AI Alive stories will have an AI-generated label to notify users that the content was created with AI. Plus, this content will have C2PA metadata embedded, which is a technical standard that helps others identify that the video is AI-generated, even if it’s downloaded and shared beyond TikTok.

“We are always building with safety in mind, and the same goes for our AI innovations,” TikTok said in a blog post. “As this technology enables new forms of creative expression, it undergoes multiple trust and safety checks to protect our community. To help prevent people from creating content that violates our policies, moderation technology reviews the uploaded photo and written AI generation prompt as well as the AI Alive video before it’s shown to the creator.”

TikTok notes that people can report videos that they think break the app’s rules and that the app conducts a final safety check once a creator shares an AI Alive story.

Technology moves on, and SanDisk is ready to double the read speeds of my current champion at a higher price for file storage space. Yes, you'll pay more per terabyte with PCIe 5.0, but the WD_BLACK SN8100 actually delivers better value on its read speeds for those who regularly create/render/transfer gigantic files.

Why you can trust Windows Central Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.

I've tested a wealth of modern motherboards that all promote the latest and greatest processor and memory support, but a jump from PCIe 4.0 to 5.0 for M.2 solid-state drives (SSDs) has been a little more reserved.

Everything has its generational improvement, and storage was never going to be an exception, but it hasn't felt like we've really needed to jump ahead when PCIe 4.0 drives are incredibly fast already.

Nevertheless, SanDisk (owned by Western Digital but still taking over its SSD division, with WD_BLACK still aimed at gamers) is promoting its ""world's fastest"" SN8100 NVMe SSD with up to 14,900 MB/s read speeds.

Can it be worth jumping ship from the excellent Samsung 990 PRO running at PCIe 4.0 speeds for a PCIe Gen 5 bump? I took a 2TB sample for a test drive to find out for this WD_BLACK SN8100 review.

Ben Wilson Senior Editor, PC Builder I've built a huge range of custom desktop PCs for myself, friends, and family, ranging from strict budget-grade towers to no-holds-barred gaming rigs. At this point, I know which tech is overpriced, even if it often tempts me.

Double the speeds of my last-gen PCIe 4.0 SSD. What did I not like? Higher temperatures lead to mandatory heatsinks.

WD_BLACK SN8100: Pricing and specifications

SanDisk offers two styles of the WD_BLACK SN8100 NVMe SSD, one with a heatsink and another without. Each comes in three size variants at launch: 1TB, 2TB, and 4TB, while the company explained to me that 8TB models are expected later in 2025.

You can buy the WD_BLACK SN8100 1TB for $179.99 at Amazon, with more third-party retailers expected to list the NVMe drive for the same price. 2TB and 4TB variants retail for $279.99 and $549.99 MSRP, respectively, with a price for the 8TB SSD to be confirmed.

For the SN8100 variant with a heatsink, you can expect to pay $199.99 for 1TB, $299.99 for 2TB, and a whopping $569.99 for 4TB.

SanDisk expects the PCIe Gen 5 SN8100 to be a step-up from the PCIe Gen 4 WD_BLACK SN850X, selling on Amazon with 2TB for $149.99 at the time of writing, and offering up to 7,300 MB/s read speeds.

WD_BLACK SN8100: What's good

I've relied on using Samsung's PCIe 4.0 990 PRO SSDs as primary boot drives in Windows 11 for a while, but it'll soon be time to upgrade. (Image credit: Ben Wilson | Windows Central)

Running a triplet of CrystalDiskMark tests on the 2TB WD_BLACK SN8100 PCIe 5.0 sample showed a 14,472 MB/s read speed at its best, 428 MB/s away from its advertised maximum. Comparing that to the 7,467 MB/s read speed I achieved with my existing 1TB Samsung 990 PRO PCIe 4.0 SSD shows a larger gap than the 17 MB/s gap of the last gen's 7,450 MB/s maximum example, but it's nothing that feels egregious.

WD_BLACK SN8100 PCIe 5.0 2TB vs. Samsung 990 PRO PCIe 4.0 1TB SSD in CrystalDiskMark. (Image credit: Ben Wilson | Windows Central)

Nevertheless, it's easy for me to ignore the ""distance from maximum"" stat when I compare more of a ""MB/s per dollar"" metric, as the WD_BLACK SN8100 is delivering double the read speeds of my Samsung 990 PRO and doing it with better value at MSRP. SanDisk can give me around 50 MB/s per dollar, while Samsung hits closer to 43 MB/s per dollar when the 2TB 990 PRO is on sale for $169.99 at Amazon.

Frankly, a 14,472 MB/s read speed is hilarious, even for the ""high-level"" gaming that SanDisk is trying to cover, but the price is right; PCIe Gen 5 just comes with a higher cost for storage. There is a downside that I'll get into in a moment, but it's nothing that the WD_BLACK SN8100 doesn't have an answer for, even if the answer is usually spending more money.

WD_BLACK SN8100: What's not so good

Most of the WD_BLACK SN8100 temperature readings in HWiNFO look slightly elevated over PCIe Gen 4 as expected, but one red outlier raised my eyebrows. (Image credit: Ben Wilson | Windows Central)

No matter what SanDisk does with the WD_BLACK SN8100, it can't escape the fact that pushing more data will lead to higher SSD temperatures; it's just science. That'll be why it's offering a variant with a bundled heatsink at a $20 premium, but I'm not sure it'll be enough to offset the increase in heat to cover the 5 years of warranty it offers.

Essentially, PCIe 5.0 drives run hot.

The 2TB WD_BLACK SN8100 isn't running hot all the time; in fact, it's barely operating at 5°C higher than my 1TB Samsung 990 PRO during regular operation under Windows 11. However, repeated stress tests with CrystalDiskMark showed maximum ASIC controller temperatures hitting 99°C while the last-gen drive's sensor never peaked readings above 48°C.

I'd take it with a pinch of salt, as these readings came from HWiNFO, which has shown irregular readings for me versus what my BIOS detects in the past (though it has proven reliable overall). The remaining sensors never exceeded 55 °C, which is far more reasonable, but still higher than PCI 4.0 drivers using the same motherboard-provided heatsink.

The moral of the story is to use a heatsink with PCIe 5.0 drives. We're past the days of running M.2 drives without some kind of heat dissipation, whether that's provided by your motherboard OEM or the SSD manufacturer. Again, SanDisk isn't doing anything wrong here, but you should take proper precautions before splashing out on a fancy new PCIe 5.0 drive to avoid burning it out.

WD_BLACK SN8100: Also consider

WD_BLACK SN8100: Should you buy it?

It still feels strange to see SanDisk logos on Western Digital drives, but this coupling has existed for a while now. (Image credit: Windows Central | Ben Wilson)

✅ You should buy this if ...

You're a content creator working with 4K+ gameplay footage There aren't many reasons to double the read/write speeds of PCIe 4.0 drives in the realm of gaming alone, but turning those moments into daily videos could help make an argument for rapid file creation.

You want to ""future proof"" your PCIe 5.0 desktop If you're going all-out on a rig with up-to-date parts, there's nothing more current than this. You might not see all the benefits right away, but SanDisk gives you a 5 year warranty just in case.



❌ You should not buy this if ...

You don't have a heatsink (or space for one) You'll need to control temperatures if you expect to see speeds hitting the advertised 14,900 MB/s maximum. PCIe 5.0 runs hot, and I can't genuinely suggest that a heatsink is ""optional"".



I'll be honest; I didn't expect to care at all about a PCIe Gen 5 SSD, but I remember feeling the same way about DDR5 RAM when that generation leap happened for memory. It seems absurd at first, trying to understand who needs 14+GB/s, but technology moves on whether I care or not, and SanDisk has proven you can make a leap without financially trashing your user base.

$279.99 will feel intense for 2TB storage space, but in terms of the value delivered for read speeds, the WD_BLACK SN8100 delivers what it claims.

That's the real caveat, here: If you don't need the absolute fastest speeds, then you don't need this drive. However, if you'll benefit, and can protect the drive with a suitable heatsink, then SanDisk is offering long-term value to creators handling 4K footage and other gigantic files with one of the best SSDs in a new generation."|"Yes, you'll pay more per terabyte with PCIe 5.0, but the WD_BLACK SN8100 actually delivers better value on its read speeds for those who regularly create/render/transfer gigantic files.

In a JerryRigEverything teardown, the Pixel 9a overall does quite well. The screen, despite being older Gorilla Glass 3, holds up to scratches as good as anything else. The plastic back scratches as expected, and the metal frame is indeed metal. The only thing remotely out of the ordinary is that the mesh covering the speaker grill can be dislodged relatively easily.

So why is the video titled “DO NOT BUY THE GOOGLE PIXEL 9A” then?

While it’s more than a bit exaggerated, the problem boils down to the battery. Google has been using glue to hold down the battery inside of the device. It’s not an uncommon practice, but many brands, including Samsung and Apple, have moved away from this. The problem with glue, especially the excessive amounts that Google seems to be using, is that it makes it very hard to remove the battery to replace it. There’s a safety risk to the person replacing it, as well as potential damage to the device.

As mentioned, this is a trend across Google’s phones, but the Pixel 9a seems like an especially bad case. Using some alcohol, the Pixel 9 Pro XL’s battery was removed with minimal damage and effort. But the Pixel 9a’s battery is already seen being slightly deformed in this video, despite a lot of alcohol being used. Pixel 7a wasn’t easy to remove either, but it also appears to have been easier than Pixel 9a.

With Google promising 7 years of updates, a battery replacement will be needed at some point, and it certainly seems not only in the customer’s or planet’s interest, but in Google’s best interest to fix this problem.

Google 's stalwart search button has a new neighbor: AI Mode. The artificial intelligence feature is being tested directly beneath the Google search bar beside a ""Google Search"" button, replacing the ""I'm Feeling Lucky"" widget. The new feature, though not widely available yet, is being tested in a location where Google rarely makes changes. A company spokesperson confirmed the feature began rolling out to some users over the past week. The spokesperson said the company tests many experiments with its users of ""Labs,"" Google's experimental unit that tests new features for those who opt in. They added that tested products do not always go on to launch broadly. The latest feature test shows Google is considering using its most valuable real estate to expose users to its AI technology as it continues to be under pressure to compete in generative AI-driven search.

Since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, Alphabet investors have been concerned that OpenAI could take market share from Google in search by giving consumers new ways to seek information online. In October, OpenAI pushed further and launched ""ChatGPT search,"" positioning the company to better compete with search engines such as Google, Microsoft 's Bing and Perplexity. Microsoft has invested close to $14 billion in OpenAI, yet OpenAI's products directly compete with Microsoft's AI and search tools, such as Copilot and Bing. Though the company's flagship AI product Gemini has shown equal or better performance than top competition, it has been trying to grow its user base to compete with ChatGPT. Google's Gemini AI product has 35 million daily active users, according to a recent Google analysis revealed during an antitrust court session in April. That was compared to ChatGPT's estimated 160 million daily active users, the analysis stated.

Ahead of the console’s launch in June, more and more publishers are sharing new details about the Switch 2 versions of games that are already on Switch, and many will require a $10 fee in order to unlock them. But what exactly are you paying for?

In the case of first-party Nintendo games, it’s pretty clear. The Mario maker already revealed new content and features coming to the Switch 2 versions of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom for an extra $10, such as additional story logs, achievements, and daily stat bonuses for Link. Super Mario Party Jamboree, meanwhile, is getting new modes and Kirby and the Forgotten Land is effectively getting a DLC expansion, both for $20 more than the existing versions.

While making some of that stuff exclusive to the Switch 2 versions of the games is perhaps questionable, it’s at least clear what you’re getting for paying to upgrade (or alternatively, you can access the new content for “free” with a paid Switch Online membership). In the case of third-party games, however, it’s much less obvious. Hogwarts Legacy owners on Switch recently reported seeing an option for a $10 upgrade to the Switch 2 version in the eShop, and a similar option is already listed for Civilization 7.

Warner Bros. Games says the $10 upgrade pack gets players DLSS support, no load screens in the open world, faster broom flying, 1080p resolution in handheld mode, and mouse controls. Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma players will need the upgrade pack to access better frame rates and mouse controls as well. The Switch 2 version of Civ 7 follows a similar pattern, but also supports increased map sizes, higher player counts in multiplayer, and GameChat (Behavior Interactive is making the new version).

While fans could just play the Switch 1 version on their new Switch 2s using backwards compatibility, neither game looks particularly good on the current hardware, providing an extra incentive to upgrade. Nintendo’s hardware developers previously said that Switch 2 is different enough from the current console to require a layer of software emulation for backwards compatibility, but it’s hard to no in any given case just how fully-fledged the upgraded versions of games are.

Not every third-party game is going this route. Sonic X Shadow: Generations is $50 on Switch 2, the same as its price last fall on Switch 1. Though unfortunately on its website, Sega confirmed there’s no upgrade path at all between two versions. It also remains to be seen how indie games like Hades 2, which launches on both Switch 1 and Switch 2 at the same time, bridge the next-gen gap. Supergiant Games previously confirmed the action-RPG roguelike runs at 1080p on the newer hardware, but wouldn’t say if that would cost fans extra.



Players have been through this song-and-dance before when games jumped from $60 to $70 between PlayStation 4/Xbox One and PS5/Xbox Series X/S. Even that rollout happened more slowly, though. PS5 upgrades for Sony games were free up through Horizon Forbidden West, which the company backed down on charging for following online backlash. After that, Sony at least tried to sweeten the pot with new accessibility settings and bonus “Director’s Cut” content in some cases, like Nintendo is doing now.

But plenty of third-party “next-gen” upgrades, like Borderlands 3 and No Man’s Sky, have remained free like Borderlands 3 and No Man’s Sky. How many game upgrades on Switch 2 will do the same? For launch at least, it doesn’t look like many. And I assume Nintendo is only just getting started with finding ways to double-dip on its back catalog with Switch 2 editions of other games like Splatoon 3, Luigi’s Mansion 3, and Super Mario Odyssey. Maybe other publishers will follow suit. Who’s ready to pay $10 for a version of Mortal Kombat 1 or Doom (2016) without insane load times?

201|https://www.theverge.com/drone/666425/dji-mavic-4-pro-on-sale-preorder-adorama-bh-photo|DJI said Mavic 4 Pro wouldn’t launch in US but these stores are selling it anyhow|2025-05-13 22:49:24+00:00|"is a senior editor and founding member of The Verge who covers gadgets, games, and toys. He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.

By the time you read these words, it’s quite possible that Adorama will be out of stock of the new DJI Mavic 4 Pro. But when I wrote them, the US-based retailer was still selling a drone that wasn’t supposed to go on sale in the US at all, with roughly 70 left in stock.

This morning, I wrote how DJI was skipping the US with its most advanced drone yet, citing Trump’s tariffs among other reasons for the decision. DJI did not send the drone to US reviewers, and it wouldn’t provide US prices when we asked.

But Adorama and B&H, two rival camera stores based in New York City, apparently didn’t get the message!

Today, they both listed the drone for $2,699 — or $3,549 for the Fly More Kit, or $4,649 for the Creator Combo with the fancy new controller with the folding sticks and swiveling 1600-nit screen, or $1,299 for that controller all by its lonesome. B&H even issued a press release.

B&H is only offering preorders today; I confirmed with Miguel Perez in the store’s drone department that “we don’t yet have it in stock,” and he wasn’t sure when stock might arrive. “It’s a little bit of a grey area for logistics between the US and China for aircraft,” he admits. But he says B&H isn’t taking anyone’s money — “we don’t charge until it ships” — and that he’s heard other US retailers like Adorama are selling the drone this very week.

Adorama sales rep Steve Chill confirms that over the phone, and offers to put one on hold for me, because he says they’re moving fast. “We had a few hundred in stock, now we’re down to 70,” he says. “They’ll be gone tomorrow.”

Over the phone, he says he has the $3,549 Fly More Combo right now if I want, though he’s out of the $2,699 base model. (At the time I reached out, Adorama’s website was showing the entry model in stock, shipping next week, though it’s now just listing a preorder again; however, the new DJI RC Pro 2 controller appears to be in stock too.)

It’s not clear what’s happening. Did DJI ship some to the US early, but not enough for a full launch, perhaps? DJI spokesperson Daisy Kong doesn’t have an answer for me yet.

Patch 01.003.000 is out now across PC and PlayStation 5.

Following a number of teases from developer Arrowhead, Helldivers 2 has unleashed a new invasion push from the Illuminate alien faction. This brings with it new enemies, as detailed on the PlayStation Blog, including the Stingray (jetfighters that provide Illuminate support from the sky, targeting Helldivers and lining up devastating strafing runs), and the Crescent Overseer, which has the ability to lay barrages on Helldivers in cover.

There’s also the Fleshmob, which is described as a “failed” Illuminate experiment: “a Frankenstein’s monster of Voteless parts turned into a brute battlefield force that the Helldivers must work hard to destroy.”

Arrowhead teased “sightings of other, even larger ships, though details remain unclear on their abilities.” So perhaps there will be more for players to discover once they jump into the game.

Meanwhile, Helldivers 2 now has weapon customization and progression for the first time. Now, most primary weapons have levels that are achievable by completing missions, which then in turn unlock new attachments obtainable through Requisition. In addition to attachments, players can also unlock patterns for their weapons.

Here’s the official blurb:

Whether it's tweaking sights for precision, changing color patterns, adjusting magazines for ammo capacity, muzzles to optimize weapon performance characteristics or adjusting under-barrel attachments for the handling you want, you're in command of how your weaponry performs on the battlefield. This level of individual attunement is sure to make your favorite primary best in its class.

Arrowhead has also unlocked and deployed a stash of patterns for the FRV themed on the Viper Commandos, Freedom's Flame, Chemical Agents, and Truth Enforcers Warbonds. This backlog of patterns unlock on May 15, with the launch of the Masters of Ceremony Warbond.

And finally, the Superstore has been changed so items you want are always available, as opposed to players having to wait for items to come back into rotation.

Outside new features, patch 01.003.000 brings with it an extensive balance pass, with changes to spread, drag, sway, melee weapons stamina cost, shrapnel spawning, and fire damage. Check out the patch notes in full below.

🦑 New Illuminate Enemies

**Stingray: ** Jetfighters that provide Illuminate support from the sky, targeting Helldivers and lining up devastating strafing runs. **Crescent Overseer: ** Has the ability to lay barrages on Helldivers in cover. Fleshmob: A failed Illuminate experiment made up of Voteless parts turned into a brute battlefield force that the Helldivers must work hard to destroy.

⚖️ Balancing

Weapon balances:

Spread

Drag

Sway

Melee weapons stamina cost

Shrapnel spawning

Fire damage

Spread: Spread refers to how much a projectile veers from the point you're aiming at when you fire. This rebalance primarily targets SMGs and sidearms, which previously had noticeably higher spread values. We've reviewed all primary, sidearm, and support weapons with the intent to significantly reduce spread overall, as it didn’t make much sense for these specific weapons to have such high inaccuracy.

Drag: Drag determines how quickly a projectile loses speed over distance, affecting its damage. We've increased drag for pistol-caliber ammunition (used in SMGs and some sidearms) to better represent its shorter, wider projectile compared to rifle rounds. As a result, these weapons will be slightly less effective at longer ranges.

Sway: Sway refers to how much the weapon's aim shifts, influenced by factors like movement and stance. It represents the weapon's inertia and stability—so weapons with lower ergonomics will experience less sway, while those with higher ergonomics will have more. Sidearms will naturally have more sway than primaries due to the lack of support features like stocks. This balance patch specifically focuses on adjusting sway for primaries and sidearms.

Stamina Cost: All melee weapons now consume less stamina when attacking, reducing the cost from 0.1 to 0.05. This change makes melee combat less punishing and allows for easier repositioning between strikes. The affected weapons include the CQC-30 Stun Baton, CQC-19 Stun Lance, CQC-5 Combat Hatchet, and the Entrenchment Tool.

Shrapnel spawning: With this update, shrapnel will now always spawn in a full 360-degree spread, regardless of where the explosion occurs. This means weapons like the R-36 Eruptor will now more reliably hit the intended target with their shrapnel. In addition, we’ve adjusted shrapnel performance against armor. Shrapnel now has reduced effectiveness at poor impact angles, to reflect its lack of design for armor penetration in such situations. These shrapnel balance changes will impact the following weapons:

R-36 Eruptor

G-6 Frag Grenade

AC-8 Autocannon

Balance Changes: Armor Penetration decreased on shrapnel projectiles from 3-3-3-0 to 3-3-2-0

Each of these numbers represent an angle threshold, which means we’ve reduced the AP value of 3 to 2 in the last range where a shrapnel projectile would penetrate an enemy.

Frag Grenade

Increased Shrapnel spawned from 30 to 35

Autocannon Flak

Increased Shrapnel spawned from 25 to 30

Fire and Flamethrowers: This update aims to better balance fire damage between direct hits (like those from flamethrowers) and burn effects over time, while also introducing scaling of fire damage depending on the size of the enemy. Previously, burn damage didn’t scale well against larger enemies, making putting them on fire feel less effective in those encounters.

Now, the larger the enemy, the more damage they take while burning. However, bigger enemies will also be slightly more resistant to ignition. Additionally, direct fire damage now scales with enemy size—so large enemies like Chargers will still take roughly the same damage as before, while smaller enemies will take slightly less.

We have also increased the magazine capacity of the FLAM-66 Torcher and the FLAM-40 Flamethrower because putting stuff on fire is fun!

Damage

Burning damage now scales with enemy size and will do more damage over time to larger enemies

Fire direct damage also scales with enemy size. The base damage of direct fire hits has been lowered as compensation. This means that large enemies will take roughly the same amount of damage as before, while smaller enemies will take slightly less

Time to ignite

Larger enemies now take longer to ignite

Robotic enemies are harder to set on fire than organic ones

Incendiary Ammunition and Lasers are now less effective at igniting enemies, but once they do, the resulting burn damage is more impactful thanks to the new scaling system

The Helldiver

The Helldiver is now slightly more resistant to being set on fire

Burn damage taken by the Helldiver remains unchanged

Sway decreased from 1 to 0.8

Fire rate increased from 25 to 32

Fixed a bug that allowed players to cancel the Eruptor's round cycling animation, effectively increasing its fire rate The intent with these changes:

The improvements made to the Eruptor are designed to compensate for the removal of the reload exploit, ensuring that its overall power remains steady or even improved

PLAS-39 Accelerator Rifle

Drag decreased from 1.5 → 0.1

Is now categorized as an energy weapon in the loadout menu

The changes to drag means it wont lose speed and damage as it travels through the air and does the damage you would expect it to do

Sidearm weapons

GP-31 Ultimatum

Is now affected by the Hellpod Optimization Booster

Explosion damage increased from 1000 to 2000

Explosion inner radius decreased from 4 to 2 m

Projectile damage decreased from 3500 to 1000

Demolition strength decreased from 50 to 40

Sway increased from 1 to 1.3

**The intent with these changes: **

We want to maintain the Ultimatum's overall power level while rebalancing how that power is delivered—shifting more of the damage from the projectile itself to the explosion. Previously, the Ultimatum behaved more like a massive kinetic projectile (similar to the 380mm shell) because of its high projectile damage and relatively weaker explosion. This update reinforces its intended identity as a powerful explosive weapon, emphasizing high explosive damage over impact force

Most heavy enemies will now die from a close hit instead of a direct hit, except for the Factory Strider

Additionally, due to its reduced demolition strength, the Ultimatum will no longer destroy Stratagem Jammer Objectives or landed Illuminate Warp Ships through their shields. However, the dropships now have health, allowing the Ultimatum to destroy them once the shield is down

P-2 Peacemaker

Decreased Spread from 30 to 10

Sway increased from 1 to 1.2

204|https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-doom-the-dark-ages-id-softwares-new-tech-is-a-defining-moment-for-this-generation|Doom: The Dark Ages - id Software's latest is a defining moment for current generation technology|2025-05-13 18:13:06.189084+00:00|"With each passing generation, technology enjoyers around the world breathlessly await the arrival of a new id Software game. While the id of today is far removed from its origins, the mission remains the same - to produce beautiful, state of the art visuals at blistering frame-rates. The studio's latest work is no exception. Doom: The Dark Ages marks the arrival of id Tech 8 and with it, a massive slate of impressive tech arrives. From its reliance on ray tracing to its robust physics simulation and brand new materials system, all the through to massive scale battles boasting sublime physics and animation, this is a phenomenal technical showcase and a fantastic game.

One of the things I really appreciate about modern id Software games is the studio's willingness to experiment and pivot. While the fundamentals of Doom: The Dark Ages are largely similar - shoot, pummel and otherwise vanquish demon hoards - the way in which this is achieved varies dramatically. Doom Eternal is a very different game compared to the 2016 reboot and this is also true of Doom: The Dark Ages, which shifts to much larger, open areas with higher enemy counts and very different mechanics. It is this desire to change the formula that helps drive the underlying technology. Fundamentally, id Tech 8 was designed to enable this particular game very specifically - which means it needed to support larger maps, more on-screen enemies and major changes to the way everything is lit.

When it comes to major changes from id Tech 7, the most impactful arguably stems from its shift to fully ray traced lighting, but beyond the obvious, ray tracing is used for other techniques and to improve the development experience. Similar to Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, the headline feature is ray traced global illumination. This allows for light sources to directly and indirectly light the surrounding space, creating beautiful, realistic and natural results. Unlike Eternal, The Dark Ages features a lot of soft lighting from the often dark skies above rather than high intensity electric lights everywhere.

Doom: The Dark Ages - DF Deep Dive Review - The id Tech 8 Engine Is Stunning With the generous assistance of id Software, Digital Foundry is able to take you behind the scenes of the id Tech 8 engine technology.Watch on YouTube

Doom: The Dark Ages uses an irradiance cache in probe volumes. Before ray traced lighting like this, developers would often pre-calculate these results through pre-computing or 'baking'. This technique meant that world lighting was more static and the actual iteration and build times were much slower. This is one of the most important shifts for the team. Speaking with Billy Khan, Director of Engine Technology at id Software, he noted that ray tracing essentially allowed them to shift to a What You See is What You Get model or WISIWYG. This means that when using id Studio, artists can adjust lighting directly in the editor and see the results instantly: something that would previously require baking to even preview, so it saves a lot of time, allowing the team to work at a much larger scale.

When played on the PC, players can also take advantage of ray traced specular reflections much like Doom Eternal. The result is good but the game features a much higher concentration of very rough materials so it's less noticeable compared to Doom Eternal's shiny wonderland of pain. In addition, ray tracing is used for impact effects and footsteps. The idea here is that by leveraging RT, it's possible to more realistically blend the material with the decals to create something that feels bespoke for every situation. For hit impacts, RT helps determine the most accurate positioning when rendering these decals on models.

Fully ray-marched volumetrics are also part of the mix. From the clouds to the fog and more, the game now leans heavily on ray-marched effects to lend the game a thicker atmosphere. This technique isn't new, but it's still rather uncommon yet produces tremendous results. When it comes to these volumetric effects, artists can essentially paint and manipulate them in real-time. Artists can create fast-moving clouds, variable cloud cover and shapes and generally just generate beautiful and interesting visual results. The large open outdoor areas basically necessitated a move towards a more robust system like this and it does work well.

While on the subject of lighting and shadow, Doom: The Dark Ages also makes use of two other depth enhancing features - SSDO for ambient occlusion and parallax occlusion mapping. Both of these increase surface depth and complexity. While the RTGI solution is very effective, it still has precision limitations which necessitate the use of a screen-space solution but SSDO in this case is used both in direct and indirect situations with shadows applied in the correct direction per local light sources making it far more effective overall.

Speaking of parallax effects, this brings us to the game's extremely robust and flexible materials system. Firstly, designers can now combine up to eight bespoke physically-based material layers on a single surface. This allows artists to create more complex surfaces while avoiding tiling and keeping the memory footprint in check. One of the key benefits is how damage to these surfaces reveals underlying materials - if you unload on a wall, for instance, the underlying structural material is revealed and chunky, parallax occlusion mapping helps create the impression of actual damage to the surface. This can also be used in situations where shooting the mud blasts away at its surface causing more water to fill in, erxpanding the size of the puddles. Basically, surfaces are inherently reactive to your actions that go beyond a traditional decal system - the combination of more advanced decals and material composition layers adds a lot to the presentation.

Physics also receive a significant upgrade - it's a complex collection of systems that work in tandem to massively improve interactivity. My favourite addition is the inclusion of breakable objects - and these are featured all over the game, from railings that smash apart when you walk through them, buildings and structures that realistically collapse in pieces as you engage with them and scenery that reacts to your movements. It's all here and it's very precise. Shoot individual chunks and pieces of an object and it breaks just as you'd expect before collapsing under its own weight. At its core, id worked closely with Havok to deliver the tooling for use in id Studio. The team focused on perfecting a powerful rigid body collision system while minimising object inner-penetration and exhibiting realistic weight and mass. These objects needed to properly behave amidst the chaotic combat loop while remaining performant.

It's not just about the rendering. Doom: The Dark Ages' physics enhancements create memorable moments of destruction. | Image credit: Digital Foundry

But there's a lot more to Doom: The Dark Ages. Firstly, there's the weather and wind systems which are extremely robust. The wind system controls things like vegetation animation - wind direction and speed are taken into account across foliage. Using fluid simulation, the game also features more complex secondary motions. For instance, if you fire an explosive weapon near a patch of grass, the explosion causes the foliage to react. Cloth simulation is also in the game so flags, the Slayer's cloak and more are all included in the wind simulation. The idea was to create a cohesive wind system that made the world feel alive and consistent across the board.

When coupling this with the atmospheric effects, fog volumes and weather, I'd say that id Software achieved its goal. The very first stage takes place during a rainstorm and everything works in tandem to create something that feels unbelievably intense and beautiful. Of course, this needed to extend across the entire environment, so id also introduced a new water surface simulation which allows proper ripples and reactions in bodies of water. I'm a sucker for effects like this - it's nothing new but it's always wonderful to see.

The key here is that all these systems allowed the team to create environments that feel dramatically different than what has come before. The prior two games were all about high contrast and bright lights but RT - in combination with the other technologies - allows id to pursue a more subdued, darker tone without the usual visual limitations, and it's all depicted at a much larger scale. In Doom Eternal, Super Gore Nest was the most geometrically dense map from its original campaign but with The Dark Ages, there are maps featuring upwards of ten times more detail. These maps are broken up into multiple sectors and a single sector can offer as much geometric detail as the entirety of Super Gore Nest.

Doom: The Dark Ages delivers the same kind of enemy hordes that the 2D-sprite based originals had - but augmented with remarkable physics, dismemberment and animation. | Image credit: Digital Foundry

Prior to launch, I pondered if id had shifted towards a virtualised geometry system along the lines of Unreal Engine's Nanite but it turns out that's not actually the case. Rather, the studio has simply expanded the number of LODs, improved blending between them, honed their scene-culling systems and basically focused first on pixel quality above all else. To that end, pop-in can still be observed at times but most of the scenery appears extremely stable while running fast. In addition, grass rendering is also offloaded entirely to the GPU and tessellated according to camera proximity. In practice, I found that pop-in issues were mostly not noticeable outside of specific vegetation issues or the occasional distant texture.

Since we're talking about these large, complex maps, another key improvement is the addition of a proper data streaming system. Prior id Tech games needed to store the map in memory upon loading - but now everything is broken up into a multitude of sectors which means less data is needed in RAM when loading into a mission. As a result, the loading times stand as among the fastest I've seen this gen. It's so fast that I almost question the inclusion of loading screens at all. This has gameplay implications too - it means that when you die, the time to continue is ultra short making you want to keep trying which is key for high difficulty settings.

Next up, let's talk about the enemies. There are multiple elements in play that make for some beautifully responsive animation, hit reactions and behaviour. That starts with the individual animations: characters move with proper weight, shifting that weight as they change direction - and the way they storm the battlefield in huge numbers feels amazing. In addition, as you kill them, the way they stumble, fall and blow away is very satisfying, highlighting excellent secondary animation. This also highlights the new gore system. As you fire on foes, flesh breaks away in a shower of blood, leaving exposed bone and sinew below the surface. On top of all this, the engine is now capable of supporting many more on-screen enemies at once. This is the first modern Doom game that manages to get close to capturing the original games in terms of sheer enemy numbers. The shift to polygon graphics put massive limitations on this in the past but no longer.

The new approach to cutscenes is worth showcasing. Yes, id has included more story sequences in Doom. On paper, this sounds like an ill-advised idea but in reality, I really enjoyed them. I'll leave you to judge the narrative itself but the quality of the cutscenes represents a gigantic leap forward from prior id Software titles. Character models, lighting, camera effects, colour grading and more are all set up beautifully. To accomplish this, id developed a more robust cinematics editing tool allowing artists to dial in every pixel with excruciating detail. Due to the real-time nature of RT lighting, the team could essentially light each scene as if it were a movie set. Thankfully, as far as pacing is concerned, these scenes tend to play only at the start and end of a mission and serve as a nice breather.

So, I've concentrated on the technology but the fact is that I'm a huge fan of Doom old and new - and I've got lots to say about the new game itself. It's an interesting one as, fundamentally, it is a very different experience compared to the last two entries. The whole stand and fight approach means the flow of combat differs as you're ultimately less mobile - but that doesn't mean you don't have a lot of movement options.

While it's a little slow at first, once you have full access to your arsenal, the game really takes off. In fact, there are aspects here that remind me of bullet hell shooters. There are projectiles, of course, but also elements like shield-wielding foes that come in groups - you'll quickly learn that taking them out involves slamming your shield into theirs after unloading a few rounds and then they blow up. It's all about comboing your attacks together to take out larger groups faster. As before, Doom still has you identifying threats and tackling them appropriately, it's just that the way you deal with these threats has changed. Furthermore, the glory kill system is radically changed - most attacks do not actually take control from you as they did before.

Doom: The Dark Ages - DF Review - PS5/PS5 Pro/Xbox Series X|S Console Showdown Our exploration of the id Tech 8 engine used the PC version to show the features at their highest - current - fidelity (path tracing is still to come!) but the console versions are great too, as you'll see here in Oliver Mackenzie's PS5, PS5 Pro and Xbox Series coverage.Watch on YouTube

That said, having just played through Doom Eternal again in Nightmare mode while going for 100 percent completion, I still haven't decided yet if I will enjoy The Dark Ages as much as its predecessor. Once I finish a nightmare run, I can judge it - and for me, that's the ultimate test. Looking back, I was critical of Doom Eternal when I previewed The Dark Ages, but returning to the game and powering through the nightmare mode, it reminded me just how good it is. For now, I would say that Doom: The Dark Ages is at least on par in terms of quality, just different.

Honestly, while playing the game, I couldn't help but think of adjacent games in Doom's past such as Heretic from Raven or even the original Quake. It has a dark fantasy ambience to the point that it feels like it could have been a sequel to one of those games as well. Still, overall, having replayed several of its missions multiple times, I'm fairly certain that this is going to occupy a similar space to other id Software classics. The moment you take over the Slayer, it's immediately clear that it feels better than nearly every other shooter on the market - the controls feel virtually flawless.

I'm very happy with Doom: The Dark Ages overall and I'm pleased to see that id Tech is still delivering. While 60 fps has become much more common this generation, it's still amazing to see a game doing so much high-end rendering and physics while filling its gigantic stages with hordes of enemies while at the same time delivering a superb high frame-rate experience. As you might imagine, I highly recommend it - but we still haven't shared everything we want to about this defining game: we'll be back soon with a PC performance review, an interview with the developers and a look at the path tracing upgrade as soon as that becomes available."|"Doom: The Dark Ages marks the arrival of id Tech 8 and with it, a massive slate of impressive tech arrives.

Microsoft is redesigning the Start menu in Windows 11 this month with a new, wider design that finally lets you disable the recommended feed of files and apps. While the new Start menu looks different to what exists in Windows 11 today, this design refresh could have looked a lot different as Microsoft has now revealed in concept images.

In a blog post detailing the process of redesigning the Start menu, Microsoft has revealed five concept designs that could have radically overhauled how the menu works in Windows. One includes an even more rounded menu with widget-like functionality, and a separate For You section that lists Teams meetings, YouTube videos, and recently used files.

Another concept has the For You section separated at the side, with the main menu focused on categories of apps, and another prototype imagines a landing page as the Start menu, complete with shortcuts, apps, files, and separate sections to access your Android phone, personalized app lists, and creation tools. There’s even a start menu concept that appears to take up the entire vertical space of a screen, complete with separated sections that you seem to scroll vertically to access.

Microsoft experimented with having a For You section at the side of the Start menu. Image: Microsoft One concept was focused largely on app categories. Image: Microsoft This prototype filled most of the vertical space and had separate sections and a landing page. Image: Microsoft This design is a lot more rounded and has a separate For You section. Image: Microsoft

“Whiteboards, Figma frames, floor-to-ceiling paper prototypes—nothing was too scrappy,” says the Windows design team. “We sketched out a plethora of layouts, letting ourselves go wild and discover new things before applying the editorial pen.”

Microsoft tested its various Start menu designs with more than 300 Windows 11 fans and even co-creation calls with select fans. “We watched eye-tracking heat maps swirl, counted scroll wheels, and listened for ’oh!‘s of delight to know where we were hitting the mark,” says the design team.

The focus of the new Start menu has been on being able to easily see your apps, customizability, speed, and not overhauling it too much to “respect three decades of muscle memory.” The result is a new Start menu that’s bigger and more customizable than what exists today. Being able to remove the recommended feed will be a welcome addition for many, and the phone companion panel looks like it’s fully built into the Start menu to provide quick access to recent calls, messages, and phone files.

Microsoft is testing this new Start menu with Windows Insiders over the coming month, so expect to see it show up for all Windows 11 users in the coming months."|"Microsoft is redesigning the Start menu in Windows 11 this month with a new, wider design that finally lets you disable the recommended feed of files and apps.

209|https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/598877/nintendo-switch-2-forecast-price-not-tariffs|Nintendo says its low-balled Switch 2 forecast is about price, not tariffs|2025-05-13 17:08:25+00:00|"is senior editor, U.K., providing news, analysis, and criticism of film, TV, and games. He has been covering the business & culture of video games for two decades.

Last week, Nintendo predicted it would sell 15 million Switch 2 consoles in its current financial year. This would actually be a fantastic result — equalling Switch, and just about any console you care to mention — but analysts called the figure “conservative” and “on the low side.” That’s just how high the expectations for Switch 2 sales are.

The consensus was that Nintendo’s conservative estimate was due to uncertainty around President Donald Trump’s tariffs, but in some unusually direct comments during an investor Q&A, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa denied this was the case. Instead, he said it was the system’s high price that has made Nintendo cautious in its outlook.

“Nintendo Switch 2 is priced relatively high compared to Nintendo Switch, so we recognize that there are corresponding challenges to early adoption,” Furukawa said. “We are taking steps like bundling software with the hardware to accelerate adoption in the first fiscal year, aiming to get off to the same start we did with Nintendo Switch.”

Furukawa cautioned that investors shouldn’t get carried away over the extreme demand for Switch 2 pre-orders. Due to the system’s high price, he said that “even if there is momentum around the launch, we know it will not be easy to keep that momentum going over the long term through the holiday season and beyond.”

Furukawa said that its production capacity for Switch 2 was “not a factor” in settings its forecast, and neither was the unstable economic situation. “The tariff situation in the U.S. or a possibility of a recession did not affect

our sales volume forecast either,” he said.

He went on to give Nintendo’s fullest statement yet in response to U.S. tariffs, saying that it was working on the assumption that the current tariff rates would persist for the rest of the financial year, which would result in “a negative impact of several tens of billions of yen at the profit level.”

“Our basic policy is that for any country or region, if tariffs are imposed, we recognize them as a part of the cost and incorporate them into the price,” he said. “However, this year marks our first new dedicated video game system launch in eight years, so given our unique situation, our priority is to maintain the momentum of our platforms, which is extremely important for our dedicated video game platform business, and to rapidly expand the install base of our new hardware. Consequently, if the assumptions on tariffs change, we will consider what kind of price adjustments would be appropriate, taking into account various factors such as the market conditions.”

To translate this from CEO-speak: Nintendo would usually slap the cost of tariffs onto the price of its hardware, but didn’t do so in this case because it wants to sell as many Switch 2s as possible. It’s not ruling out making pricing changes as the situation evolves (but it probably won’t)."|"Last week, Nintendo predicted it would sell 15 million Switch 2 consoles in its current financial year.

Paleontologists at the Manitoba Museum and Royal Ontario Museum (ROM) have discovered a remarkable new 506-million-year-old predator from the Burgess Shale of Canada. The results are announced in a paper in the journal Royal Society Open Science.

Mosura fentoni was about the size of an index finger and had three eyes, spiny jointed claws, a circular mouth lined with teeth and a body with swimming flaps along its sides. These traits show it to be part of an extinct group known as the radiodonts, which also included the famous Anomalocaris canadensis, a meter-long predator that shared the waters with Mosura.

However, Mosura also possessed a feature not seen in any other radiodont: an abdomen-like body region made up of multiple segments at its back end.

""Mosura has 16 tightly packed segments lined with gills at the rear end of its body. This is a neat example of evolutionary convergence with modern groups, like horseshoe crabs, woodlice, and insects, which share a batch of segments bearing respiratory organs at the rear of the body,"" says Joe Moysiuk, Curator of Paleontology and Geology at the Manitoba Museum, who led the study.

There's a 'new' fossil discovery at ROM! Jean-Bernard Caron, Richard M. Ivey Curator of Invertebrate Palaeontology, shows us a new moth-like predator from the 506-million-year-old Burgess Shale of British Columbia, which is one of the most important palaeontological sites in the world. Credit: ROM

The reason for this intriguing adaptation remains uncertain, but the researchers postulate it may be related to particular habitat preference or behavioral characteristics of Mosura that required more efficient respiration.

With its broad swimming flaps near its midsection and narrow abdomen, Mosura was nicknamed the ""sea-moth"" by field collectors based on its vague appearance to a moth. This inspired its scientific name, which references the fictional Japanese kaiju also known as Mothra.

Only distantly related to real moths—as well as spiders, crabs, and millipedes—Mosura belongs on a much deeper branch in the evolutionary tree of these animals, collectively known as arthropods.

""Radiodonts were the first group of arthropods to branch out in the evolutionary tree, so they provide key insight into ancestral traits for the entire group. The new species emphasizes that these early arthropods were already surprisingly diverse and were adapting in a comparable way to their distant modern relatives,"" says study co-author Jean-Bernard Caron, Richard M. Ivey Curator of Invertebrate Paleontology at ROM.

Several fossils of Mosura additionally show details of internal anatomy, including elements of the nervous system, circulatory system, and digestive tract.

""Very few fossil sites in the world offer this level of insight into soft internal anatomy. We can see traces representing bundles of nerves in the eyes that would have been involved in image processing, just like in living arthropods. The details are astounding,"" Caron adds.

Instead of having arteries and veins like we do, Mosura had an ""open"" circulatory system, with its heart pumping blood into large internal body cavities called lacunae. These lacunae are preserved as reflective patches that fill the body and extend into the swimming flaps in the fossils.

""The well-preserved lacunae of the circulatory system in Mosura help us to interpret similar, but less clear features that we've seen before in other fossils. Their identity has been controversial,"" adds Moysiuk, who is also a Research Associate at ROM. ""It turns out that preservation of these structures is widespread, confirming the ancient origin of this type of circulatory system.""

Of the 61 fossils of Mosura, all except one were collected by ROM between 1975 and 2022, mostly from the Raymond Quarry in Yoho National Park, British Columbia. Some also came from new areas around Marble Canyon in Kootenay National Park, 40 km to the southeast, which have revealed spectacular new Burgess Shale fossils, including other radiodonts: Stanleycaris, Cambroraster and Titanokorys. One previously unpublished specimen of Mosura was also studied that had been collected by Charles Walcott, the discoverer of the Burgess Shale.

""Museum collections, old and new, are a bottomless treasure trove of information about the past. If you think you've seen it all before, you just need to open up a museum drawer,"" Moysiuk says.

The Burgess Shale fossil sites are located within Yoho and Kootenay National Parks and are managed by Parks Canada. Parks Canada is proud to work with leading scientific researchers to expand knowledge and understanding of this key period of Earth's history and to share these sites with the world through award-winning guided hikes.

The Burgess Shale was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1980 due to its outstanding universal value and is now part of the larger Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks World Heritage Site.

Many radiodont fossils can be seen on display in ROM's Willner Madge Gallery, Dawn of Life, in Toronto, and a specimen of Mosura will be exhibited for the first time at the Manitoba Museum in Winnipeg later this year.

Webb’s NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera) zoomed into Jupiter’s poles to capture the planet’s fast-varying auroral features, which are 100 times brighter than the ones seen on Earth.

“We wanted to see how quickly the auroras change, expecting them to fade in and out ponderously, perhaps over a quarter of an hour or so,” Jonathan Nichols, a researcher at the University of Leicester in the United Kingdom, and lead author of a new paper published in the journal Nature Communications, said in a statement. “Instead, we observed the whole auroral region fizzing and popping with light, sometimes varying by the second.”

On Earth, auroras take place when energetic particles from the Sun interact with the planet’s magnetic field and its atmosphere, creating shimmering displays of light across the skies known as the Northern and Southern Lights. Aside from the Sun’s particles, Jupiter has an additional source that creates its auroras. Jupiter’s strong magnetic field grabs charged particles from its surroundings and accelerates them to high speeds. These speedy particles, some of which are thrown into space by Jupiter’s orbiting moon Io, slam into the planet’s atmosphere at high energies and excite the gas, causing it to glow.

Using Webb’s recent observations of Jupiter’s aurora, the scientists studied emissions from a molecule called trihydrogen cation. The special molecule is formed when energetic particles rip an electron off of a hydrogen molecule, and that molecule then reacts with other hydrogen molecules. The study found that the trihydrogen cation emissions are far more variable than they previously believed. Understanding the behavior of the special molecule helps scientists better understand how Jupiter’s atmosphere cools and heats.

The scientists also took images of Jupiter’s auroras with NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope at the same time Webb made its observations, capturing them in ultraviolet light. They uncovered a strange discrepancy between the two sets of data, the brightest light observed by Webb had no real counterpart in the Hubble images.

“This has left us scratching our heads,” Nichols said. “In order to cause the combination of brightness seen by both Webb and Hubble, we need to have a combination of high quantities of very low-energy particles hitting the atmosphere, which was previously thought to be impossible. We still don’t understand how this happens.”

The team plans on carrying out follow-up observations of Jupiter’s auroras using Webb and compare them to data collected by the ongoing Juno mission. The spacecraft has been orbiting the gas giant since 2016, capturing Jupiter and its moons in exquisite detail. Webb previously captured images of Jupiter’s glowing auroras at its north and south poles, providing scientists with a new perspective of the planet’s light display in infrared wavelengths."|"Using the telescope’s most recent observations of the gas giant, scientists uncovered a curious discrepancy between how Jupiter’s auroras appear to Webb versus Hubble.

A Venera-8 descent module (source: NASA archive)

The spacecraft, dubbed Kosmos 482, had orbited the Earth since it launched in March 1972. It followed the Soviet Venera 8 probe and would have most likely been Venera 9 if it weren't for a suspected engine failure that left the lander stranded in orbit around the Earth for more than half a century.

The rocket stage associated with the spacecraft and its main bus reentered Earth's atmosphere decades ago, but the lander remained in orbit until this weekend. Scientists were concerned that since the lander was designed to survive a reentry through the atmosphere of Venus, it might also make it through Earth's atmosphere relatively intact, with its near-500 kg mass impacting the surface at around 240 km/h.

The European Space Agency (ESA) published radar images last week from the Tracking and Imaging Radar (TIRA) at the Fraunhofer Institute for High Frequency Physics and Radar Techniques in Germany that appeared to show the spacecraft tumbling. Kosmos 482 was spotted over Germany at 0804 CEST (0604 UTC) on May 10, but was not detected one orbit later at the expected 0932 CEST (0732 UTC) pass.

Astronomer Jonathan McDowell noted reports from Russia's space agency, Roscosmos, that re-entry was at 0624 UTC over the Indian Ocean, but added that the agency provided ""no details on how they conclude that.""

Soviet probe from 1972 set to return to Earth ... in May 2025 READ MORE

Roscosmos posted on Telegram, ""According to calculations by specialists from TsNIIMash (part of Roscosmos), the device entered the dense layers of the atmosphere at 9:24 Moscow time, 560 km west of Middle Andaman Island, and fell in the Indian Ocean west of Jakarta.""

ESA said, ""A precise time and location of its reentry have so far not been identified. We have not received any reports on direct visual observations of the final reentry or of any impacts on ground.""

The final fate of the probe is unclear, other than a terse ""the Kosmos-482 spacecraft ceased to exist"" from Roscosmos via a translation service. Since it was tumbling, it seems likely that it burned up – while the probe was built to withstand entry into the atmosphere of Venus, orientation was important. Additionally, the heat shield could have sustained damage or cracked during the probe's stay in orbit.

We now anxiously await the rise of our alien overlords from the depths of the Indian Ocean. ®"|"A Venera-8 descent module (source: NASA archive)The spacecraft, dubbed Kosmos 482, had orbited the Earth since it launched in March 1972.

Company executives said in a May 14 earnings call that three factors contributed to the “landing anomaly” on its IM-2 mission. On that mission the Nova-C lander fell on its side in a crater when it touched down in the south polar region of the moon March 6. The lander was not able to generate sufficient power from its solar panels, leading to an end of the mission barely 12 hours after touchdown.

One factor was an issue the company previously discussed with the lander’s laser altimeters. Steve Altemus, chief executive of Intuitive Machines, said there was “signal noise and distortion” from the altimeters during the lander’s final descent “that did not allow for accurate altitude readings.”

A second factor was conditions at the south polar region of the moon, where low sun angles cause long shadows that “challenged the precision capability of our landing system.” A third, related factor, is that craters appeared differently at lower altitudes, given those lighting conditions, than they did in reference images from NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, affecting the lander’s optical navigation system.

Altemus said the company is incorporating the lessons learned from IM-2 into its next lander mission, IM-3, scheduled for next year. That lander will include dissimilar and redundant altimeters, which will go through more “flight-like” testing ahead of launch. The lander will also have a new lighting-independent sensor to measure surface velocity, and will have an enhanced crater database for improved optical navigation.

Those changes, he said, will not delay the mission. There will be a “slight” increase in cost because of the additional sensors, but he did not quantify the increase.

Altemus said the company is in negotiations with NASA and other customers on the IM-2 mission about up to $14 million in success payments. Some of the payloads were able to carry out limited tests on the moon: a NASA drill, for example, was able to test its mechanisms but was not able to drill into the lunar surface as planned. Altemus said the company wants to complete those negotiations by the end of the quarter or early the following quarter.

Diversification and Artemis changes

Intuitive Machines emphasized in the earnings call its efforts to diversify beyond lunar lander. Altemus highlighted efforts such as design of an orbital transfer vehicle based on the Nova-C lander being done with an unnamed government customers, as well as ongoing work with the Air Force Research Lab’s JETSON project for a spacecraft that uses nuclear electric propulsion.

The company also won in February a $10 million grant from the Texas Space Commission to support work on a lifting body reentry vehicle. Intuitive Machines is working with Rhodium Scientific on ways the vehicle could be used to conduct microgravity research, returning biomedical or other experiments to Earth.

“This diversification and execution builds on our core strengths and positions us as a broader infrastructure and data services provider across the space economy,” he said.

That diversification comes as NASA’s approach to lunar exploration faces potential major changes. The administration’s fiscal year 2026 budget proposal would cancel the lunar Gateway and phase out the Space Launch System and Orion after the Artemis 3 mission, replacing those vehicles with commercial capabilities.

Altemus said Intuitive Machines does not expect any near-term impacts of those changes on programs like Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS), the primary customer of the company’s first lunar lander missions, or the Lunar Terrain Vehicle (LTV) Services program to develop a commercially provided rover for later Artemis crewed missions.

“We do not see a direct impact into the CLPS budget,” he said, with the agency expected to award two task orders for missions later this year. Likewise, he said NASA has not signaled any plans to delay the selection in November of a company to develop the LTV as Intuitive Machines and two competitors, Astrolab and Lunar Outpost, complete preliminary design reviews under awards NASA made last April.

One potential change, he said, may be in the awards made in that next phase. NASA previously stated it planned to select just one of the three companies for funding to develop the LTV. The agency is considering a scenario where it may also select a second company to advance their rover design through a critical design review.

Changes to the overall Artemis architecture, he said, could create new opportunities for the company. He mentioned testimony he and executives of other lunar lander developers gave to the House Science Committee’s space subcommittee in April, where they called for an expansion of the CLPS program. That included more frequent missions and larger landers, along with bulk buys of missions.

“With the reformulation of Artemis, there’s a place for heavy cargo delivery to put infrastructure on the surface of the moon,” he said, along with commercial communications and navigation networks. “We’re playing right into that reformulation with these capabilities.”

Intuitive Machines reported $62.5 million in revenue in the first quarter of 2025, a 14% increase from the fourth quarter of 2024. The company reported an adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) loss of $6.6 million in the quarter, although the company said it was on track for positive “run-rate” adjusted EBITDA by the end of the year."|"WASHINGTON — Problems with laser altimeters along with lighting and terrain challenges caused Intuitive Machines’ second lunar lander to fall on its side when it landed on the moon in March.

These high-speed interactions trigger electromagnetic processes that occasionally eject three protons, yielding gold atoms. Billions are made, but only for a split second.

Lead to Gold: A Modern Alchemical Feat at CERN

In a newly published study in Physical Review Journals, scientists from CERN’s ALICE experiment have observed something extraordinary: the transformation of lead into gold inside the powerful Large Hadron Collider (LHC).

For centuries, alchemists dreamed of turning lead into gold. Known as chrysopoeia, this ancient quest was based on the idea that both metals were heavy and shared similar properties. Of course, we now know that lead and gold are completely different elements, and no chemical process can turn one into the other.

A New Kind of Alchemy—Powered by Physics

In the 20th century, nuclear physics revealed that atoms could change from one element into another. This could happen naturally through radioactive decay or be triggered in laboratories using high-energy particles like neutrons or protons. Gold has been made this way before, but now, the ALICE team has measured a completely new method of element-changing magic—this time using near misses between high-speed lead atoms.

When two lead nuclei race through the LHC at nearly the speed of light, they sometimes just miss each other. Instead of colliding head-on, they pass close enough to trigger intense electromagnetic forces. These interactions can generate bursts of energy that change the very identity of atomic nuclei, including turning lead into gold.

Photon Bursts and Nuclear Shifts

The electromagnetic field emanating from a lead nucleus is particularly strong because the nucleus contains 82 protons, each carrying one elementary charge. Moreover, the very high speed at which lead nuclei travel in the LHC (corresponding to 99.999993% of the speed of light) causes the electromagnetic field lines to be squashed into a thin pancake, transverse to the direction of motion, producing a short-lived pulse of photons. Often, this triggers a process called electromagnetic dissociation, whereby a photon interacting with a nucleus can excite oscillations of its internal structure, resulting in the ejection of small numbers of neutrons and protons. To create gold (a nucleus containing 79 protons), three protons must be removed from a lead nucleus in the LHC beams.

“It is impressive to see that our detectors can handle head-on collisions producing thousands of particles, while also being sensitive to collisions where only a few particles are produced at a time, enabling the study of electromagnetic ‘nuclear transmutation’ processes,” says Marco Van Leeuwen, ALICE spokesperson.

Counting Gold Atoms in the Particle Smash

The ALICE team used the detector’s zero degree calorimeters (ZDC) to count the number of photon–nucleus interactions that resulted in the emission of zero, one, two and three protons accompanied by at least one neutron, which are associated with the production of lead, thallium, mercury and gold, respectively. While less frequent than the creation of thallium or mercury, the results show that the LHC currently produces gold at a maximum rate of about 89,000 nuclei per second from lead–lead collisions at the ALICE collision point. Gold nuclei emerge from the collision with very high energy and hit the LHC beam pipe or collimators at various points downstream, where they immediately fragment into single protons, neutrons, and other particles. The gold exists for just a tiny fraction of a second.

A Fleeting Treasure: Billion Gold Atoms, But No Jewelry

The ALICE analysis shows that, during Run 2 of the LHC (2015–2018), about 86 billion gold nuclei were created at the four major experiments. In terms of mass, this corresponds to just 29 picograms (2.9 ×10-11 g). Since the luminosity in the LHC is continually increasing thanks to regular upgrades to the machines, Run 3 has produced almost double the amount of gold that Run 2 did, but the total still amounts to trillions of times less than would be required to make a piece of jewellery. While the dream of medieval alchemists has technically come true, their hopes of riches have once again been dashed.

Beyond Gold: Improving Collider Physics

“Thanks to the unique capabilities of the ALICE ZDCs, the present analysis is the first to systematically detect and analyse the signature of gold production at the LHC experimentally,” says Uliana Dmitrieva of the ALICE collaboration.

“The results also test and improve theoretical models of electromagnetic dissociation, which, beyond their intrinsic physics interest, are used to understand and predict beam losses that are a major limit on the performance of the LHC and future colliders,” adds John Jowett, also of the ALICE collaboration.

NASA's Europa Clipper spacecraft, en route to Jupiter's icy ocean moon Europa, recently captured a ghostly infrared portrait of Mars — a cosmic photo op that helped scientists fine-tune an instrument destined to investigate whether Europa can support life as we know it.

The image, a blurry composite of more than a thousand grayscale snapshots later colorized by scientists, was taken during a precision flyby of Mars on March 1, 2025. At its closest point, the spacecraft skimmed just 550 miles (884 kilometers) above the Martian surface, in a maneuver known as a gravity assist, which used the Red Planet's gravitational pull to slow the spacecraft and adjust its orbit around the sun ahead of a crucial leg of its nearly 2-billion-mile (3.2 billion km) journey to Jupiter .

The brief encounter also served a scientific purpose: It gave the mission team a chance to test the spacecraft's instruments in deep space, including the thermal imager E-THEMIS (short for Europa Thermal Imaging System), which will eventually scan Europa's surface for signs of recent or ongoing geologic activity. Over an 18-minute span on March 1, the instrument took over 1,000 grayscale images — one per second — which began arriving on Earth on May 5, according to a NASA statement .

To confirm the instrument's accuracy, the mission team compared the new infrared imagery with long-term thermal maps of Mars gathered by NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter, which has been observing the Red Planet since 2001. The Odyssey team even coordinated observations before, during, and after the Europa Clipper flyby to allow for a direct side-by-side comparison, according to the statement.

""We wanted no surprises in these new images,"" Phil Christensen, a professor of earth and space exploration at Arizona State University who serves as the principal investigator of the E-THEMIS instrument, said in the statement. ""The goal was to capture imagery of a planetary body we know extraordinarily well and make sure the dataset looks exactly the way it should, based on 20 years of instruments documenting Mars.""

E-THEMIS detects infrared light — essentially heat — allowing scientists to map temperatures across a planetary surface. After the spacecraft reaches the Jupiter system in 2030, these thermal scans will help identify hotspots that could point to recent geologic activity beneath Europa's icy shell, according to the statement.

Infrared imaging will also help pinpoint where Europa's vast subsurface ocean might lie closest to the surface, scientists say. The moon is etched with ridges and fractures, features that scientists suspect result from oceanic forces — like rising water or convection currents — pulling apart the ice from below.

""We want to measure the temperature of those features,"" Christensen said. If Europa is active, its fractures could be warmer than surrounding ice — especially where the ocean lies near the surface or past eruptions left lingering heat, he added.

The Mars flyby also marked the first full in-flight test of Clipper's radar instrument, which couldn't be tested in its entirety on Earth due to the size of its antennas. Preliminary telemetry suggests the test was successful, with detailed analysis of the data still to come, the statement read."|"This infrared image of Mars, captured during a close flyby on March 1, 2025, helped NASA validate key instruments aboard the Europa Clipper probe ahead of its mission to Jupiter's icy ocean moon Europa.

Sustainably produced, biodegradable materials are an important focus of modern materials science. However, when working with natural materials such as cellulose, lignin or chitin, researchers face a trade-off. Although these substances are biodegradable in their pure form, they are often not ideal when it comes to performance. Chemical processing steps can be used to make them stronger, more resistant or more supple—but in doing so, their sustainability is often compromised.

Empa researchers from the Cellulose and Wood Materials laboratory have now developed a bio-based material that cleverly avoids this compromise. Not only is it completely biodegradable, it is also tear-resistant and has versatile functional properties. All this takes place with minimal processing steps and without chemicals—you can even eat it. Its secret: It's alive.

The study is published in the journal Advanced Materials.

Optimized by nature

As the basis for their novel material, the researchers used the mycelium of the split-gill mushroom, a widespread edible fungus that grows on dead wood. Mycelia are root-like filamentous fungal structures that are already being actively researched as potential sources of materials. Normally, the mycelial fibers—known as hyphae—are cleaned, and chemically processed if necessary, which brings about the above-mentioned trade-off between performance and sustainability.

The Empa researchers chose a different approach. Instead of treating the mycelium, they use it as a whole. As it grows, the fungus not only forms hyphae, but also a so-called extracellular matrix: a network of various fiber-like macromolecules, proteins and other biological substances that the living cells secrete.

""The fungus uses this extracellular matrix to give itself structure and other functional properties. Why shouldn't we do the same?"" explains Empa researcher Ashutosh Sinha.

""Nature has already developed an optimized system,"" adds Gustav Nyström, head of the Cellulose and Wood Materials lab.

With a bit of additional optimization, the researchers gave nature a helping hand. From the enormous genetic diversity of the split-gill, they selected a strain that produces particularly high levels of two specific macromolecules: the long-chain polysaccharide schizophyllan and the soap-like protein hydrophobin.

Due to their structure, hydrophobins collect at interfaces between polar and apolar liquids, for example, water and oil. Schizophyllan is a nanofiber: less than a nanometer thick, but more than a thousand times as long. Together, these two biomolecules give the living mycelium material properties that make it suitable for a wide range of applications.

A living emulsifier

The researchers demonstrated the versatility of their material in the laboratory. In their study, they showcased two possible applications for the living material: a plastic-like film and an emulsion. Emulsions are mixtures of two or more liquids that normally do not mix. All you have to do to see an example is open the fridge: Milk, salad dressing or mayonnaise are all emulsions. Various cosmetics, paints and varnishes also take the form of emulsions.

One challenge is to stabilize such mixtures so that they do not separate into individual liquids over time. This is where the living mycelium shows its strengths: Both the schizophyllan fibers and the hydrophobins act as emulsifiers, and the fungus keeps releasing more of these molecules.

""This is probably the only type of emulsion that becomes more stable over time,"" says Sinha. Both the fungal filaments themselves and their extracellular molecules are completely non-toxic, biologically compatible and edible—the split-gill mushroom is routinely eaten in many parts of the world. ""Its use as an emulsifier in the cosmetics and food industry is therefore particularly interesting,"" says Nyström.

From compost bags to batteries

The living fungal network is also suitable for classic material applications. In a second experiment, the researchers manufactured the mycelium into thin films. The extracellular matrix with its long schizophyllan fibers gives the material very good tensile strength, which can be further enhanced by targeted alignment of the fungal and polysaccharide fibers within it.

""We combine the proven methods for processing fiber-based materials with the emerging field of living materials,"" explains Nyström.

Sinha adds, ""Our mycelium is a living fiber composite, so to speak.""

The researchers can control the fungal material's properties by changing the conditions under which the fungus grows. It would also be conceivable to use other fungal strains or species that produce other functional macromolecules.

Working with living materials also presents certain challenges.

""Biodegradable materials always react to their environment,"" says Nyström. ""We want to find applications where this interaction is not a hindrance but maybe even an advantage.""

However, its biodegradability is only part of the story for the mycelium. It is also a biodegrader: The split-gill mushrooms can actively decompose wood and other plant materials.

Sinha sees another potential application here: ""Instead of compostable plastic bags, it could be used to make bags that compost the organic waste themselves,"" says the researcher.

There are also promising applications for mycelium in the field of sustainable electronics. For example, the fungal material shows a reversible reaction to moisture and could be used to produce biodegradable moisture sensors. Another application that Nyström's team is currently working on combines the living material with two other research projects from the Cellulose and Wood Materials laboratory: the fungal biobattery and the paper battery.

""We want to produce a compact, biodegradable battery whose electrodes consist of a living 'fungal paper,'"" says Sinha.

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:

On April 18, 2025, the WFI-2 instrument (which captured its first light on April 14) took images through all three of its polarizers in succession for the first time to create this view. The image is colorized to show the polarization (or angle) of the zodiacal light, a faint glow from dust orbiting the sun. Hue indicates direction, and saturation indicates degree of polarization. For example, a pastel green feature would be slightly polarized in the horizontal direction, while a deep blue feature would be strongly polarized in a diagonal direction. The sun’s location is marked with a star symbol. Other stars in the sky appear white because they are mostly unpolarized compared to the 7% polarization of the zodiacal light. The compact Pleiades star cluster appears just above center, and the V-shaped Hyades star cluster appears to the upper left of the Pleiades. Credit: NASA/SwRI

As instrument commissioning and calibration checks continue for NASA's newly launched PUNCH (Polarimeter to Unify the Corona and Heliosphere) mission, its four spacecraft continue to deliver new images—including its first rainbow-colored view of the sky and the first images taken by two of its instruments.

The goal of PUNCH is to reveal new details of how the solar atmosphere, or corona, unfolds and streams through the solar system as the solar wind. It is the first mission designed to measure the corona and solar wind in three dimensions by studying the polarization of light, which is the direction light travels after it has been scattered by particles.

In PUNCH's images, the polarization is revealed through color coding, resulting in a rainbow image that gives scientists new insight on the solar wind's movement.

Collectively, PUNCH's four satellites include one Narrow Field Imager (NFI) and three Wide Field Imagers (WFIs). The NFI is a coronagraph, which blocks out the bright light from the sun to better see details in the sun's corona. The WFIs are heliospheric imagers that view the very faint, outermost portion of the solar corona and the solar wind itself.

During commissioning, PUNCH’s NFI instrument captured this image of the new moon as it passed by the sun in the sky on April 27, 2025. The new moon appears full, because it is illuminated by Earthshine (sunlight reflected off Earth). The image helped the PUNCH team confirm that the moon will not obscure NFI’s view of the corona and solar wind. The dark circle near the bottom is the shadow of NFI’s occulter, which hides the sun. The occulter, which was not yet fully aligned with the Sun, is surrounded by a narrow bright ring of diffracted light. Around that is a large, hazy circle of stray light glinting off the occulter (the moon is inside that circle). Outside that is a small, dimmer region of the sky that is less affected by glint. Credit: NASA/SwRI

The mission's fully processed science data will stitch together views from all four spacecraft and remove artifacts from the background of space and the cameras themselves. These early images help the mission team confirm that PUNCH's cameras are in focus, working properly, and able to capture the quality observations needed to achieve the mission's goals.

Throughout the remainder of the commissioning phase, scientists will calibrate the instruments' views to reveal illuminating details in the sun's corona.

The landing occurred on Dec. 16, 2020 in the Siziwang Banner of Inner Mongolia.

A tiny glass bead retrieved by China's Chang'e-5 lunar mission is offering scientists a glimpse into the moon's hidden depths and providing insight into the violent forces that helped shape the cratered landscape.

The bead, just a fraction of an inch wide, was among the 3.7-pound (1.7-kilogram) cache of rock and soil collected by the Chang'e-5 lander in 2020 from Oceanus Procellarum, or the ""Ocean of Storms,"" a vast lava plain on the moon's near side.

Scientists analyzing the samples have identified the glass bead as a remnant of high-temperature lunar activity dating back to roughly 68 million years ago. What sets the bead apart is its unusual chemistry: it's exceptionally rich in magnesium oxide, in stark contrast to the volcanic rocks that dominate the region, a team of scientists led by Chen-Long Ding of Nanjing University in China report in a new study.

The findings suggest the bead likely formed from material excavated by a massive asteroid impact — possibly one that struck the moon with enough force to unearth rock from the upper mantle and fling it to the surface.

""This is a big step forward in understanding how the moon evolved internally,"" Tim Johnson, a professor of geology at Curtin University in Australia and a co-author of the new study, said in a statement . ""If these samples really are pieces of the mantle, it tells us that impacts can excavate otherwise inaccessible mantle material to the surface.""

The plateau surrounding Chang'e-5's landing site is dotted with over 100,000 craters larger than 328 feet (100 meters) in size, making it a challenge for scientists to match glass droplets with their specific crater of origin.

One particularly compelling theory links the bead's origin to the nearby Imbrium Basin, a massive impact site that formed nearly 4 billion years ago. Remote sensing has shown the area around the basin's edge contains minerals that match the chemical signature of the glass bead.

That basin's formation — one of the most cataclysmic in the moon's history — may have punched deep into the lunar crust, excavating material from the upper mantle and scattering it across the surface, including the area later sampled by the Chang'e-5 mission. Billions of years later, a smaller impact — occurring around 68 million years ago — likely struck this area again, re-melting some of that ancient, mantle-derived debris. The intense heat from this second collision fused the material into glass, forming glass beads like the one studied.

""This is exciting, because we've never sampled the mantle directly before,"" Alexander Nemchin, a professor of applied geology at Curtin University said in the same statement. ""The tiny glass beads offer us a glimpse of the moon's hidden interior.""

China recently opened access to its Chang'e-5 lunar samples, which are the first to be brought to Earth since the Soviet Union's Luna 24 mission in 1976. Seven institutions across six countries have been loaned small portions of the material, including two in the U.S. and one each in France, Germany, Japan and Pakistan.

Chinese researchers, in collaboration with international teams, have already made several discoveries from the samples, including the surprising finding that the material is much younger than that from the Apollo missions , suggesting volcanic activity on the moon occurred as recently as 120 million years ago. This raises the question of what fueled the volcanism in the absence of water and hot radioactive elements to generate subsurface magma. Foreign scientists now receiving samples are optimistic their specialized equipment will help answer this and other lunar mysteries.

""We look forward to scientists worldwide making more scientific discoveries, jointly expanding human knowledge and benefiting all of humanity,"" Shan Zhongde, head of the Chinese Space Agency, said on April 24 at a ceremony in Shanghai celebrating China's annual Space Day."|"A tiny glass bead retrieved by China's Chang'e-5 lunar mission is offering scientists a glimpse into the moon's hidden depths and providing insight into the violent forces that helped shape the cratered landscape.

Stretching nearly 600,000 miles (1 million kilometers) — more than twice the distance between Earth and the moon — the event was as vast as it was striking! Data suggests Earth is not in the eruption's path.

""Not sure what to call this eruption, maybe the ""bird-wing"" or ""angel-wing"" event? Either way, it is truly something to witness!"", aurora chaser Vincent Ledvina wrote in a post on X.

The filament, a long, dark ribbon of solar plasma suspended by magnetic fields, had been hanging above the sun's surface before destabilizing.

""WOW! There is an absolutely enormous filament erupting right now! It dwarfs all the filament eruptions we have seen recently,"" aurora chaser Jure Atanackov wrote in a post on X.

These filament structures are cooler and denser than their surroundings, making them appear as dark threads against the bright solar disk. When a filament erupts, it can trigger a coronal mass ejection (CME), hurling a vast plume of plasma and magnetic field into space. And this particular filament did just that.

""What a spectacular CME from the huge filament eruption earlier today! Unfortunately, it is directed north and will miss us. A direct hit from a CME like this can be high-end G4 storm material, maybe even G5,"" Atanackov wrote in a later post on X.

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:

Flamingos feed by dragging their flattened beaks forward along the bottom of shallow lakes.

Credit: Aztli Ortega

Flamingos standing serenely in a shallow alkaline lake with heads submerged may seem to be placidly feeding, but there's a lot going on under the surface.

Through studies of Chilean flamingos in the Nashville Zoo and analysis of 3D printed models of their feet and L-shaped bills, researchers have documented how the birds use their feet, heads and beaks to create a storm of swirling tornados, or vortices, in the water to efficiently concentrate and slurp up their prey.

""Flamingos are actually predators, they are actively looking for animals that are moving in the water, and the problem they face is how to concentrate these animals, to pull them together and feed,"" said Victor Ortega Jiménez, an assistant professor of integrative biology at the University of California, Berkeley, who specializes in biomechanics. ""Think of spiders, which produce webs to trap insects. Flamingos are using vortices to trap animals, like brine shrimp.""

Ortega Jiménez and collaborators at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta; Kennesaw State University in Marietta, Georgia (KSU-Marietta); and the Nashville Zoo have published their findings this week in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

The researchers found that flamingos use their floppy webbed feet to churn up the bottom sediment and propel it forward in whorls that the birds then draw to the surface by jerking their heads upward like plungers, creating mini tornados. All the while, the birds' heads remain upside down within the watery vortex, their angled beaks chattering to create smaller vortices that direct the sediment and food into their mouths, where it's strained out.

The beak of a flamingo is unique in being flattened on the angled front end, so that when the bird's head is upside down in the water, the flat portion is parallel to the bottom. This allows the flamingo to employ another technique called skimming. This involves using its long, S-shaped neck to push its head forward while rapidly clapping its beak, creating sheet-like vortices—von Kármán vortices—that trap prey.

This suite of active feeding behaviors belie the flamingo's reputation as a passive filter feeder, Ortega Jiménez said.

""It seems like they are filtering just passive particles, but no, these animals are actually taking animals that are moving,"" he said.

The principles he discovered could be used to design better systems for concentrating and sucking up tiny particles, such as microplastics, from water; better self-cleaning filters, based on chattering; or robots that, like flamingos, can walk and run in mud.

Chattering

Ortega Jiménez, a native of Puebla, Mexico, became fascinated with the feeding behavior of flamingos during a visit to Zoo Atlanta with his wife and daughter before the COVID-19 pandemic. Filming the birds' feeding behavior, he observed only ripples on the surface.

""We don't know anything about what is happening inside. That was my question,"" he said.

At the time, a postdoctoral fellow at Kennesaw State University in Georgia, Ortega Jiménez focused on flamingo feeding as his next research project. He views himself, he said, as a modern-day Darwinian naturalist, investigating the behavior of animals of all types, from nematodes and flies to springtails and birds, focusing on how the animals interact with and manipulate their surroundings, including air, water and electromagnetic fields.

From Kennesaw State, he moved to the Georgia Institute of Technology to work in the lab of Saad Bhamla, where he collaborated with engineers, and they gained access to Chilean flamingos at the Nashville Zoo. The team filmed them feeding in a large tray, using a laser to illuminate gas bubbles in the water in order to see the vortices created by the heads and beaks of the animals.

After moving to the University of Maine in Orono as an assistant professor, Ortega Jiménez refined 3D printed models of a flamingo beak and foot to study more precisely the movement of water and particles during the beak clapping, or ""chattering,"" that the birds use when eating.

In 2024, he moved again, to UC Berkeley, where he conducted experiments to see how effective the chattering and foot stomping was in capturing live brine shrimp. The new paper summarizes all of this collaborative work.

At UC Berkeley, he attached a real flamingo beak to an actuator to simulate chattering and added a small pump in the mouth to simulate the tongue and suck up the brine shrimp captured by the mouth. With this setup, he was able to establish that chattering is key to flamingo feeding.

""The chattering actually is increasing seven times the number of brine shrimp passing through the tube,"" he said. ""So it's clear that the chattering is enhancing the number of individuals that are captured by the beak.""

Stomp dancing

The feeding behavior begins with the feet, Ortega Jiménez said. If you look at a flamingo in very shallow water, you can often see its dancing-in-place or circular dancing behavior.

The feet are webbed, but as with many wading birds, they are floppy, so that when the bird lifts a foot, the webbing collapses and comes away from the bottom without the suction that makes it hard for humans to walk in mud. When walking or running, flamingos seem to slide their feet into the water instead of stomping, a technique that could help robots walk in water or mud.

Ortega Jiménez created models of both rigid and flexible flamingo feet to compare how the two designs affect fluid flow, and he found that the floppy feet are much more effective at pushing vortices of sediment out in front of each step. Rigid webbing primarily produces turbulence.

Creating a 3D model of the L-shaped beak, he was able to show that pulling the head straight upward in the water creates a vortex swirling around a vertical axis, again concentrating particles of food. He measured the head speed at about 40 centimeters per second (1.3 feet per second). The small tornados were strong enough to entrap even agile invertebrates, such as brine shrimp and the microscopic crustaceans called copepods.

Chattering also creates vortices around the beak. In this case, the flamingo keeps its upper beak stationary, though it is capable of independent motion, and moves only the lower beak—about 12 times per second during chattering, Ortega Jiménez discovered.

Tien Yee, a co-author of the paper and a professor at KSU-Marrieta, employed computational fluid dynamics to simulate on a computer the 3D flow around the beak and the feet. He confirmed that the vortices do indeed concentrate particles, similar to experiments using a 3D-printed head in a flume with both actively swimming brine shrimp and passively floating brine shrimp eggs.

""We observed when we put a 3D printed model in a flume to mimic what we call skimming, they are producing symmetrical vortices on the sides of the beak that recirculate the particles in the water so they actually get into the beak,"" Ortega Jiménez said. ""It's this trick of fluid dynamics.""

His next projects are to determine the role of the flamingo's piston-like tongue and how the comb-like edges of the beak filter prey out of briny and sometimes toxic water.

""Flamingos are super-specialized animals for filter feeding,"" he said. ""It's not just the head, but the neck, their legs, their feet and all the behaviors they use just to effectively capture these tiny and agile organisms.""

In addition to Yee, other co-authors of the paper are postdoctoral fellow Pankaj Rohilla, graduate student Benjamin Seleb and Professor Saad Bhamla at Georgia Tech; and Jake Belair of the Nashville Zoo in Tennessee.

""The final end of the universe is coming much sooner than expected but fortunately it still takes a very long time,"" said lead author Heino Falcke.

A trio of scientists at Radboud set out to calculate when the most ""durable"" celestial bodies -- white dwarf stars -- would eventually die out.

They based their calculations on Hawking radiation, named after celebrated British physicist Stephen Hawking.

Hawking postulated in the mid-1970s that black holes leak radiation, slowly dissolving like aspirin in a glass of water -- giving them a finite lifetime.

The Radboud scientists extended this to other objects in the universe, calculating that the ""evaporation time"" depends on density.

This enabled them to calculate the theoretical dissolution of the longest-lasting body, the white dwarf.

There might be a hidden ocean's worth of liquid water below the surface of Mars , seismic evidence suggests.

According to a new paper published April 25 in the journal National Science Review , recordings of seismic waves from deep within the Red Planet indicate that a layer of liquid water may be lurking in the Martian rocks between 3.4 and 5 miles [5.4 to 8 kilometers] below the surface.

The total volume of hidden water could flood the whole of Mars' surface with an ocean 1,700 to 2,560 feet [520 to 780 metres] deep, around the same volume of liquid that is contained within Antarctica's ice sheet, the study authors estimated.

Our neighboring planet was once abundant in water. In the time between Mars' formation 4.1 billion years ago to about 3 billion years ago, the Red Planet is thought to have been extremely wet, with features like valley networks, delta formations, and layered sedimentary rocks suggesting sustained water flow .

However, this abundant liquid water ""vanished as the planet transitioned to become the cold, dry environment we see today,"" paper co-author Hrvoje Tkalčić , a professor of geophysics at the Australian National University, said in a statement.

Over time, Mars lost its magnetic field, and solar radiation began stripping away its atmosphere. With a thinner atmosphere, surface temperatures dropped; the planet's liquid water began to escape into space, become trapped as ice in the subsurface or polar caps, or become locked in hydrated minerals within the planet's crust, the researchers said.

However, these methods of water loss have previously been shown to not entirely account for all the water that is estimated to have once flowed on the Red Planet, with a large volume of ""missing"" water going unaccounted for. This conundrum has long puzzled scientists, posing the question of whether there is still liquid water hidden on Mars that we have yet to find.

Flowing water carved the vast canyons of Mars before disappearing billions of years ago. New research hints that much of it may now be trapped underground. (Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/Univ. of Arizona)

This new research suggests that there is indeed liquid water buried deep below the surface of the planet. Upon analyzing seismic data from NASA's InSight lander, which landed on Mars in 2018 , researchers found that seismic waves within the planet's interior — caused by asteroid impacts and marsquakes in 2021 and 2022 — appeared to slow down between 3.4 and 5 miles [5.4 to 8 kilometers] below the surface. They suggest that this could be due to the presence of liquid water hidden within porous rocks, as seismic waves travel more slowly through liquid than they do through more solid materials.

""This 'low-velocity layer' is most likely highly porous rock filled with liquid water, like a saturated sponge,"" Tkalčić and another study co-author Weijia Sun , a professor of geophysics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, explained in an essay for the Conversation about the new study. ""Something like Earth's aquifers, where groundwater seeps into rock pores.""

The researchers suggest that this liquid water could make up the total volume of water missing from previous calculations.

""Our study indicates it's possible that much of that ancient water percolated through the porous surface rocks and was retained underground,"" Tkalčić said. ""This also matches estimates of the 'missing' water on Mars from other studies.""

Previous studies have also found that large volumes of water may be stored beneath the Martian surface in ice form , and a study from 2024 suggested that liquid water could be stored within rocks between 7 to 13 miles (11.2 to 21 km) beneath the surface.

The potential presence of liquid water on Mars is exciting to scientists, as liquid water is essential to life as we know it. While these potential reservoirs deep below the planet's surface could host some form of Martian life, we won't know if the liquid water even exists until we can drill deep into Mars and find it for ourselves.

""Future missions with seismometers and drills are needed to confirm the presence of the water at these depths and gather more clues,"" Tkalčić said."|"NASA has found evidence of Mars' water escaping into space — but new research hints that it may have also gone deep, deep underground.
There might be a hidden ocean's worth of liquid water below the surface of Mars , seismic evidence suggests.
This conundrum has long puzzled scientists, posing the question of whether there is still liquid water hidden on Mars that we have yet to find.

New insights into wandering black holes through TDEs



Mysterious forces of black holes and their impact on the universe

Astronomers have made a landmark finding in their quest for black holes where a supermassive black hole has been seen swallowing a star within the outer space of its host galaxy for the first time ever. The landmark finding refutes the age-old belief that such types of catastrophic events take place only in the immediate vicinity of galaxies' centers. The strange event, called "" AT2024tvd ,"" was 600 million light-years away and is the first-ever detection of an offset tidal disruption event (TDE) observed by optical sky surveys.A Tidal Disruption Event (TDE) is when a star strays too close to a black hole and gets torn apart by the intense gravitational pull of the black hole.This is in fact known as ""spaghettification,"" where the star gets stretched out into thin, filamentary threads, creating shock waves and unleashing a tremendous release of energy. This disastrous event sends energetic pulses of radiation that are detectable over many wavelengths of light, from X-rays to optical radiation. TDEs are typically associated with the violent gravitational forces around the centers of galaxies, where supermassive black holes reside.The ""AT2024tvd"" event is a breakthrough in our understanding of black holes. It was discovered by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and further verification through observations by NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope and Chandra X-ray Observatory, and this discovery unlocked a black hole's activity in a most unexpected manner: a ""wandering"" supermassive black hole, of order 1 million solar masses in mass, not residing at the center of its host galaxy. This is the first time that offset TDEs have been detected by optical sky surveys, presenting a new glimpse of the mysterious population of nomadic black holes. Yuhan Yao, the lead study author and University of California, Berkeley astrophysicist, pointed to the significance of the find: ""This is the first offset TDE found by optical sky surveys. It opens up the whole possibility of discovering this rare population of wanderlust black holes.""The star was engulfed by the black hole and in doing so triggered a brilliant flash of light—a more luminous and hotter supernova explosion than normal.So bright was the burst that it initiated a deluge of follow-up observations by a range of telescopes around the globe. These have cast invaluable light on the behavior of black holes, especially those that wander away from galaxy centers. The discovery not only reveals an oft-noted and never-before-seen phenomenon, but also gives us a new perspective on how black holes and their role in the universe can be studied.This short-term phenomenon was detected through optical sky surveys, which are designed to monitor transient astronomical phenomena. The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) played a crucial role in detecting this event, and subsequent observations through NASA's Hubble Space Telescope and Chandra X-ray Observatory confirmed its significance. According to Ryan Chornock, a ZTF team member, ""Now we can use TDEs to find them [wandering black holes].""Optical surveys application in TDE detection can revolutionize the way black holes are searched and studied in the universe. The achievement provides scientists with a useful tool to detect rogue black holes, which were thought to be almost impossible to detect.A black hole is a region of space in which the gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can get away. Black holes form when a massive star collapses in on itself because of its own gravity after it has burned all of its nuclear fuel. Black holes are invisible, but it could be possible to deduce that they exist based on observing the way that they alter the movement of nearby stars, gas, and light. An illustration is erratically moving stars or material sucked into a glowing disk surrounding a black hole as indirect signs of their presence.Can a black hole approach Earth? While sensational in its possibility, the likelihood of a black hole approaching Earth is extremely slim. The nearest known black hole is located thousands of light-years from Earth, and even a rogue black hole such as the one measured by this research is hundreds of millions of light-years from Earth. This provides some level of security for our solar system because black holes do not pose an immediate danger to Earth.This historic first-ever offset TDE discovery is a new chapter in black hole science, yielding new knowledge on the misbehavior of supermassive black holes and its effects. As the astrophysical community continues to study this event and other such events, we wait with bated breath for more light to be shed on the universe's most enigmatic objects. With the use of TDEs as a method of finding rogue black holes, scientists are set to explore even deeper the nature of these space monsters."|"TDEs are typically associated with the violent gravitational forces around the centers of galaxies, where supermassive black holes reside.The ""AT2024tvd"" event is a breakthrough in our understanding of black holes.

An international team of astronomers reports the discovery of two new exoplanets, a few times more massive than Earth, orbiting a sun-like star known as HD 35843. The finding was reported in a research paper published May 1 on the arXiv pre-print server.

To date, NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has identified more than 7,600 candidate exoplanets (TESS Objects of Interest, or TOI), of which 622 have been confirmed by follow-up observations. The satellite's main aim is to complete a survey of about 200,000 of the nearest brightest stars, searching for transiting exoplanets—from small, rocky worlds to gaseous giants.

HD 35843, or TOI 4189, is a metal-poor G-dwarf star with a radius of approximately 0.9 solar radii and mass comparable to that of the sun. TESS observed this star between 2018 and 2022, which resulted in the detection of a transit signal in its light curve.

Follow-up ground-based observations conducted by a group of astronomers led by Katharine Hesse of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) confirmed the planetary nature of this signal and also revealed the presence of an additional planet.

""We report the discovery and confirmation of two planets orbiting the metal-poor sun-like star, HD 35843 (TOI 4189),"" the paper reads.

The confirmed exoplanet, designated HD 35843 c, is about 2.5 times larger and 11.3 times more massive than the Earth, which yields a density at a level of 3.8 g/cm3. The planet orbits its host every 46.7 days, at a distance of 0.25 AU from it. The estimated equilibrium temperature of HD 35843 c is 479 K, therefore it is one of the coolest alien worlds discovered with TESS.

The additional non-transiting planet that was identified by follow-up radial velocity measurements received designation HD 35843 b. It is closer to the parent star—at a distance of about 0.088 AU and its orbital period is approximately 9.9 days. The planet is estimated to have a mass of at least 5.84 Earth masses.

Based on the derived properties of the newly detected extrasolar worlds, the astronomers classified HD 35843 b as a super-Earth and HD 35843 c as a sub-Neptune exoplanet. It was noted that it is still too early to draw a final conclusion regarding the composition of HD 35843 c as it may be a ""water world"" or a rocky planet with a thick hydrogen atmosphere.

When it comes to the host star HD 35843, it has an effective temperature of 5,666 K and metallicity at a level of -0.27. The age of the star is estimated to be some 2.5 billion years.

The authors conclude that the high transmission spectroscopic metric (TSM) of HD 35843 c and relatively low temperature make it a promising target to conduct a follow-up atmospheric characterization study with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in order to determine its exact composition.

As global warming causes sea ice in the polar regions to melt, it is not just the amount of sunlight entering the ocean that changes. The color of the underwater light shifts, too, and this has major consequences for life below the surface.

According to new research published in Nature Communications, these changes could significantly impact tiny but vital organisms like ice algae and phytoplankton. The study was led by marine biologists Monika Soja-Woźniak and Jef Huisman from the University of Amsterdam’s Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics.

The international team of scientists, which included physical chemist Sander Woutersen and collaborators from the Netherlands and Denmark, explored how melting sea ice transforms the underwater light environment. Light behaves very differently in sea ice compared to open water.

Sea ice reflects and scatters most sunlight, letting only a small amount through, but that small amount includes nearly all visible wavelengths. Open seawater, on the other hand, absorbs reds and greens, while allowing blue light to travel deeper. This is why the ocean appears blue to our eyes.

Molecular vibrations of water

Another key difference between ice and liquid water lies in the role of molecular vibrations. In liquid water, H₂O molecules are free to move and vibrate, which leads to the formation of distinct absorption bands at specific wavelengths. These bands selectively remove portions of the light spectrum, creating gaps in the light available for photosynthesis.

Previous research by Maayke Stomp and Prof. Huisman demonstrated that these molecular absorption features create ‘spectral niches’—distinct sets of wavelengths available for photosynthetic organisms. Phytoplankton and cyanobacteria have evolved a diversity of pigments tuned to the different spectral niches, shaping their global distribution across oceans, coastal waters, and lakes.

In ice, however, water molecules are locked into a rigid crystal lattice. This fixed structure suppresses their ability for molecular vibrations and thereby alters their absorption features. As a consequence, ice lacks the absorption bands of liquid water, and hence a broader spectrum of light is preserved under sea ice. This fundamental difference plays a key role in the spectral shift that occurs as sea ice melts.

Ecological implications

As sea ice disappears and gives way to open water, the underwater light environment shifts from a broad spectrum of colors to a narrower, blue-dominated spectrum. This spectral change is crucial for photosynthesis.

“The photosynthetic pigments of algae living under sea ice are adapted to make optimal use of the wide range of colors present in the little amount of light passing through ice and snow,” says lead author Monika Soja-Woźniak. “When the ice melts, these organisms suddenly find themselves in a blue-dominated environment, which provides a lesser fit for their pigments.”

Using optical models and spectral measurements, the researchers showed that this shift in light color not only alters photosynthetic performance, but may also lead to changes in species composition. Algal species specialized in blue light may gain a strong competitive advantage in comparison to ice algae.

According to Prof. Huisman, these changes can have cascading ecological effects. “Photosynthetic algae form the foundation of the Arctic food web. Changes in their productivity or species composition can ripple upward to affect fish, seabirds, and marine mammals. Moreover, photosynthesis plays an important role in natural CO 2 uptake by the ocean.”

The study highlights that climate change in the polar regions does more than melt ice—it causes fundamental shifts in key processes such as light transmission and energy flow in marine ecosystems.

The results underscore the importance of incorporating light spectra and photosynthesis more explicitly in climate models and ocean forecasts, especially in polar regions where environmental change is accelerating at an unprecedented rate.

These auditory representations, or sonifications , were created using data from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory, James Webb Space Telescope and Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). By assigning musical notes to various data points, space observations can be translated into sound, allowing listeners to ""hear"" the cosmos.

The three new sonifications feature data from multiple celestial objects, each representing different aspects, or developmental stages, of black holes, according to a statement from NASA.

This trio of sonifications represents different aspects of black holes and black hole evolution. WR124 is an extremely bright, short-lived massive star known as a Wolf-Rayet that may collapse into a black hole in the future. SS 433 is a binary, or double system, containing a star like our Sun in orbit with either a neutron star or a black hole. The galaxy Centaurus A has an enormous black hole in its center that is sending a booming jet across the entire length of the galaxy. (Image credit: NASA/CXC/SAO/J. Major; Sonification: NASA/CXC/SAO/K.Arcand, SYSTEM Sounds (M. Russo, A. Santaguida))

The first melody captures the potential birth of a black hole. It surrounds a massive star named WR 124 violently shedding its outer layers, producing a glowing nebula of expelled gas and dust. Located about 28,000 light-years from Earth, WR 124 is known as a Wolf-Rayet star — a bright, short-lived massive star — and, as it nears the end of its life, the process of shedding its outer layers could end in a dramatic stellar explosion (called a supernova ). That should leave behind a black hole.

The sonification of WR 124 begins with a descending scream-like sound near the star’s hot core and incorporates musical instruments like flutes, bells, harps and strings as the glowing stellar material expands outward, highlighting the nebula’s turbulent, possibly transformative phase.

The second sonification captures a cosmic duet from SS 433, a binary star system located 18,000 light-years from Earth where a sun-like star orbits a heavier companion — such as a neutron star or black hole . Fluctuating X-ray emissions are translated into different pitches and instruments, while chiming water drop sounds represent bright background stars and plucked notes signify the location of the duet amid a massive cloud of interstellar dust and gas.

The third and final movement features Centaurus A, a galaxy located 12 million light-years from Earth with a supermassive black hole at its center that's launching a powerful jet across the galaxy. In this sonification, X-ray emissions are translated into wind chime and breeze-like sounds, while visible light data is transformed into string instrument tones, capturing the galaxy’s stars and structure in a sweeping, musical finale."|"This trio of sonifications represents different aspects of black holes and black hole evolution.

Researchers have successfully produced the world’s most powerful ultrashort electron beam, shattering previous records with a peak current five times greater than existing similar beams. This remarkable breakthrough promises to revolutionize multiple scientific fields and cement America’s position at the forefront of global research innovation.

Record-breaking electron beam technology transforms scientific research

The SLAC team’s achievement, detailed in a February 2025 publication in Physical Review Letters, represents a quantum leap in particle acceleration technology. Lead researcher Claudio Emma emphasized the dual significance of their accomplishment: “We’ve not only generated an incredibly powerful beam but can control it with unprecedented precision, enabling exploration of previously unobservable physical and chemical phenomena.”

Unlike laser beams which consist of photons, electron beams comprise accelerated electrons directed along a specific path using electromagnetic fields. These particle beams must operate in vacuum conditions to prevent energy dissipation and require highly sophisticated equipment to generate and maintain. This technological distinction is crucial as electron beams interact with matter in fundamentally different ways than lasers, opening unique research opportunities.

The FACET-II facility at SLAC now holds the world’s top position for electron beam power, surpassing Germany’s European XFEL and other leading installations. This achievement comes as China accelerates development of its massive nuclear fusion center, highlighting the ongoing global competition in advanced scientific infrastructure.

Breaking the power-quality compromise with innovative techniques

One of the most significant challenges in accelerator physics has long been increasing electron beam power while maintaining beam quality. Traditionally, as beams became more compressed and powerful, they would deteriorate due to radiation emitted during acceleration—creating an apparently insurmountable trade-off.

The SLAC research team overcame this limitation through clever adaptation of free-electron laser techniques originally developed for the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS). Rather than using conventional electromagnetic fields, they implemented precise laser-based energy modulation to compress billions of electrons into a space smaller than a micrometer.

“Laser-based modulation offers dramatically improved precision compared to traditional electromagnetic approaches,” Emma explained. The implementation process involved shaping the beam within the first ten meters of a kilometer-long machine, then transporting it without losing modulation before final compression—an enormous technical challenge requiring months of meticulous adjustments.

This breakthrough comes amid other significant American advances in space science, including recent James Webb Telescope observations of the galactic center black hole revealing unexpected phenomena.

Applications spanning from astrophysics to quantum chemistry

The ultra-powerful electron beam enables scientists to investigate physical phenomena previously beyond experimental reach. Astrophysicists can now recreate plasma filaments observed in stars under laboratory conditions, testing theories about their formation and evolution in realistic settings for the first time.

Researchers at FACET-II have already utilized this breakthrough to advance plasma wakefield acceleration technology, a promising avenue for developing next-generation particle accelerators. This technology could eventually lead to more compact and efficient accelerators, potentially transforming how research facilities are designed and built.

Emma’s team intends to push boundaries further by compressing these beams to produce attosecond-scale light pulses (one billionth of a billionth of a second). Such advancement would essentially create an ultra-high-speed camera capable of capturing fleeting phenomena at unprecedented timescales, providing complementary investigation tools: electron beams for matter observation and light beams for capturing ultra-fine details.

While China makes strides in quantum computing technology, the SLAC breakthrough demonstrates continued American excellence in fundamental physics research. Scientists worldwide are now invited to test their research ideas using this new capability, with Emma extending an open invitation: “If you need an extreme beam, we have what you need. Let’s work together!”

Future horizons for American scientific leadership

The SLAC achievement positions the United States to maintain its scientific leadership role despite increasing global competition. This breakthrough follows other recent American achievements in space exploration, including NASA’s history-changing discoveries on Mars.

The implications extend beyond academic research into potential industrial applications. Electron beams already serve critical roles in various sectors—from electron microscopy and precision welding to semiconductor lithography and medical equipment sterilization. This new capability could transform these fields through higher precision, efficiency, and capabilities.

The technical expertise developed through this project also strengthens America’s scientific workforce, training a new generation of physicists and engineers in cutting-edge accelerator technology. This human capital represents a crucial component of long-term research competitiveness.

As astronomers prepare to potentially reveal our solar system’s ninth planet using advanced telescope technology, this electron beam breakthrough demonstrates how America continues pushing scientific boundaries across multiple disciplines. The SLAC achievement reinforces the United States’ commitment to maintaining its position at the forefront of global scientific innovation through sustained investment in facilities, talent, and fundamental research."|"Researchers have successfully produced the world’s most powerful ultrashort electron beam, shattering previous records with a peak current five times greater than existing similar beams.

Here’s what we lose if we don’t launch Roman.|2025-05-13 15:00:00+00:00|"The president’s proposed budget includes major cuts to NASA — among them, the elimination of funding for the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. Set to launch in just two years, Roman is poised to transform our understanding of exoplanets and the structure of the universe. Like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), it can detect both visible and infrared light — wavelengths longer than what our eyes can see. But Roman is fundamentally different in one key way: its much larger field of view. It can observe enormous swaths of the sky at once using its wide field instrument. That makes it capable of science that no other existing observatory can do, including JWST. And if it is killed, we will miss out on a generation of new scientific discoveries.

Before a telescope launches — before the headlines, the press releases and the breathtaking images — it’s hard to appreciate just how transformative it might be. The Hubble Space Telescope, for example, was built to do general astrophysics along with a handful of specific science goals, such as measuring the universe’s expansion. It not only fulfilled those aims but went on to revolutionize modern astronomy in ways no one could have fully predicted. Remarkably, Hubble launched before the first exoplanets had even been discovered. Yet once they were, Hubble became one of our most powerful tools for studying their atmospheres. JWST is already following in its footsteps.

Roman was similarly designed with a focused set of science goals, including exploring an uncharted region of exoplanet discovery space and investigating the nature of dark energy. However, since those original goals were laid out, scientists have developed a wide array of new ideas for what it could do. NASA’s website outlines Roman’s planned science — remarkable in its own right — but the telescope’s true potential extends far beyond what’s described there. Like Hubble and JWST, Roman will almost certainly uncover discoveries we don’t yet know to look for — things we haven’t yet imagined. The public rarely hears about that broader realm of possibility. In this piece, I want to spotlight just a few of those ideas — drawn from my own area of expertise: the search for moons and rings beyond our solar system. They represent just one small sliver of Roman’s enormous discovery potential beyond its already extraordinary core mission.

One of Roman’s primary missions is a microlensing survey that will detect about 2,500 exoplanets, ranging from rocky worlds like Earth to massive gas giants like Jupiter. These planets will orbit much farther from their host stars — at distances similar to those between Earth and the Sun, or even Saturn and the Sun — regions that have remained largely out of reach for current detection methods. This is a critical blind spot: almost all known exoplanets have been found using the transit or radial velocity methods, which are most sensitive to planets that orbit close to their stars. Roman will give us, for the first time, a full picture of the architecture of planetary systems, especially in their outer reaches.

In addition to those 2,500 microlensing detections, the same survey is expected to inadvertently detect thousands of transiting exoplanets. These discoveries will allow us to map how planet populations vary across our galaxy.

That alone would be revolutionary. But Roman is also uniquely capable of detecting something we’ve never conclusively observed before: exomoons.

Right now, not even a single exomoon has been confirmed to be orbiting an exoplanet. Roman may finally change that. Its microlensing survey is sensitive enough to detect moons orbiting free-floating planets — worlds that have been ejected from their home star systems. Simulations suggest that Roman could, for the first time, reveal a population of such moons.

We currently have no way of knowing how unusual Earth’s moon is. And yet, our moon may have played a crucial role in stabilizing Earth’s climate — its gravitational influence helps prevent chaotic swings in the planet’s tilt. That kind of stability could be important for making planets habitable. Moons are therefore predicted to have a significant influence on the long term climate and habitability of rocky planets. Roman’s microlensing survey could detect moons like ours around free-floating earth-sized planets — systems where the planet and moon were ejected together. That would help us answer a profound question: Are moons like Earth’s unusual or common?

Roman could also search for exomoons around young, free-floating giant planets using the transit method. Similar to how the Kepler telescope monitored thousands of stars for dips in light caused by orbiting planets, Roman can continuously observe bright, glowing, young giant planets to search for the transits of orbiting moons. If our current models of moon formation are correct, these surveys could detect around a dozen moons — potentially including ones comparable in size to Saturn’s moon Titan.

Taken together, these methods give Roman the unprecedented ability to not only detect the first confirmed exomoon, but to uncover an entire population — ranging from Earth-moon analogs to terrestrial-sized satellites orbiting giant free-floating planets. No other observatory, current or planned, has this capability. If Roman is cancelled, this potential science disappears with it, and we will remain in the dark about these systems for decades.

All of this science comes from just one of Roman’s instruments. The telescope also includes a second instrument: the Coronagraphic Instrument (CGI), which is designed to directly image exoplanets by blocking the glare of their host stars. This is extremely challenging — stars are billions of times brighter than their planets — but CGI uses cutting-edge technology to suppress the starlight and reveal the much fainter reflected light from planets orbiting the star. For the first time, we could directly observe the light from planets analogous to Jupiter and Saturn in other solar systems. Even more exciting: CGI might detect rings around these planets — rings like Saturn’s, orbiting alien worlds. JWST has already shown that in the infrared, rings and moons can outshine their host planets in some cases.

Roman’s CGI could capture the first direct images of planets orbiting other stars with Saturn-like ring systems. These rings may have formed from moons or small bodies that were torn apart by a planet’s gravity — offering clues about the history and evolution of these systems.

By detecting both exomoons and exorings, Roman would — for the first time — allow us to understand the moons and rings of our own solar system within a broader cosmic context. And this is just one part of Roman’s vast scientific potential. From probing dark energy to unraveling the processes of star and planet formation, Roman is uniquely equipped to tackle some of the biggest questions in astronomy.

We have already invested more than a decade of engineering, preparation and research into building this observatory — and we’re now just two years from launch. If Roman is cancelled now, we don’t just pause a project — we abandon a generation of science. And we close the door on discoveries that would deepen our understanding of the universe and our place in it.

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:

Today, the Argentine black and white tegu is considered an invasive species in Florida, but long before they arrived via the pet trade, their prehistoric ancestors roamed this region. Credit: Kevin Blackwell / Amphibian Foundation

Originally from South America, the charismatic tegu made its way to the United States via the pet trade of the 1990s. After wreaking havoc in Florida's ecosystems, the exotic lizard was classified as an invasive species. But a recent discovery from the Florida Museum of Natural History reveals the reptiles are no strangers to the region—tegus were here millions of years before their modern relatives arrived in pet carriers.

Described in a study in the Journal of Paleontology, this breakthrough came from a single, half-inch-wide vertebra fossil that was unearthed in the early 2000s and puzzled scientists for the next 20 years. Jason Bourque, now a fossil preparator in the museum's vertebrate paleontology division, came across the peculiar fossil in the museum's collection when he was freshly out of graduate school.

""We have all these mystery boxes of fossil bones, so I was digging through, and I kept coming across this one vertebra,"" Bourque said. ""I could not figure out what it was. I put it away for a while. Then I'd come back and say, Is it a lizard? Is it a snake? In the back of my mind for years and years, it just sat there.""

The vertebra had been found in a fuller's earth clay mine just north of the Florida border, after a tipoff from the local work crew prompted a visit from the museum's paleontologists. There was just one catch: The mine was slated to close, and its quarry, along with any exposed fossils, would soon be filled in. Working against a deadline, the scientists excavated as many fossils as they could and brought them back to the museum, where the vertebra sat in storage, its identity unresolved.

Years later, Bourque stumbled across an image of tegu vertebrae while looking through studies for a new research paper.

""I saw the tegu, and I just knew right away that's what this fossil was,"" Bourque said.

Today, tegus are of particular interest to Florida's wildlife biologists and conservationists. Their bold patterns and docile attitudes make them attractive pets, but that often changes once they reach nearly 5 feet in length and weigh 10 pounds. Exotic pets have a knack for slipping free—or being released—into the wild, where they can take a heavy toll on native ecosystems. This is the case with modern tegus in Florida.

But until this point, there was no record of prehistoric tegus in North America. Bourque needed evidence to back up his revelation. Paleontologists typically work with multiple bones to identify an animal, but Bourque had just a single vertebra. He recruited his colleague, Edward Stanley, director of the museum's digital imaging laboratory, who saw an opportunity to try out a new machine-learning technique—one that doesn't rely on a paleontologist's decades of specialized knowledge.

With a CT scan of the unidentified fossil, Stanley carefully measured and landmarked each bump, hole and furrow of the fossil. Next, he needed vertebrae from other tegus and related lizards for comparison. Fortunately, the team had access to an abundance of specimens thanks to the museum's openVertebrate (oVert) project, a free, online collection of thousands of 3D images of vertebrates.

Instead of measuring these images by hand, Stanley used a technique developed by Arthur Porto, the museum's curator of artificial intelligence for natural history and biodiversity, to automatically recognize and fit the corresponding landmarks onto more than 100 vertebrae images from the database. By comparing the data of all their shapes, he determined the fossil matched the other tegus and pinpointed its original position at the middle of the lizard's spinal column.

While the fossil was unmistakably a tegu vertebra, it wasn't an exact match with any of the specimens in the database. This meant the team had uncovered a new species, which they named Wautaugategu formidus. Wautauga is the name of a forest near the mine where the fossil was discovered. Although the word's origin is unclear, it is thought to mean ""land of the beyond,"" which Bourque and Stanley found fitting for the long-extinct species, that—despite having ancestral ties to South America—ended up in present-day Georgia.

""Formidus,"" a Latin word meaning ""warm,"" alludes to the reason these lizards likely wound up in the southeastern United States in the first place. The fossil is from the Middle Miocene Climatic Optimum, a particularly warm period in Earth's geologic history.

At the time, sea levels were significantly higher than today, and with most of Florida underwater, the historic coastline would have been near the site of the fossil bed. Tegus are terrestrial lizards, but they are strong swimmers. The warm climate may have tempted them to travel from South America into present-day Georgia, but the region did not remain hospitable for long.

""We don't have any record of these lizards before that event, and we don't have any records of them after that event. It seems they were here just for a blip, during that really warm period,"" Bourque said.

The tegus would likely have struggled and ultimately disappeared as global temperatures cooled. Like other egg-laying animals, their reproduction is highly dependent on temperature, and the cold may have limited their ability to produce or hatch eggs.

Finding more tegu fossils may help demystify the prehistoric lizard's brief stint in North America.

""I'm ready to go up to the Panhandle and try to find more fossil sites along the ancient coastal ridge near the Florida-Georgia border,"" Bourque said.

Stanley, meanwhile, hopes the next find won't languish in storage. The combination of 3D modeling and artificial intelligence to identify fossils without relying on decades of specialized knowledge could dramatically speed up the process. With open access to data worldwide, it could even lead to a global database for fossil identification.

""There are boxes full, shelves full, of fossils that are unsorted because it requires a huge amount of expertise to identify these things, and nobody has time to look through them comprehensively,"" Stanley said. ""This is a first step towards some of that automation, and it's very exciting to see where it goes from here.""

According to a new study published May 7 in the journal Science Advances , just 0.001% of the deep seafloor (anything below 656 feet, or 200 meters) has been explored — despite it covering about two-thirds of Earth's surface. This area is roughly equivalent to the size of Rhode Island.

""There is so much of our ocean that remains a mystery,"" Ian Miller , chief science and innovation officer at the National Geographic Society, which contributed to the study's funding, said in a statement. Miller was not himself an author of the study.

The deep ocean floor is characterized by immense pressure and near-freezing temperatures, and is home to a variety of strange and often elusive creatures . It plays a crucial role in carbon storage, and is believed to host many unknown species — some of which could be medically or scientifically valuable.

Most of what we know about this seafloor is based on visual imaging from manned submersibles, remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), or tow cameras tethered to ships.

In the new study, researchers analyzed the proportion of deep seafloor that had been visually explored by compiling 43,681 records of deep sea dives that included optical imaging.

They used two methods to estimate how much of the deep seafloor had been observed by humans, one tracking the path of vehicles along the seafloor used in each dive, and the other using time spent by the vehicle at the ocean floor. For the dive path method, they estimated that a total of 822 square miles (2,129 square kilometers) had been observed. Using the time-based method, they estimated a visual seabed coverage of 1,476 square miles (3,823 sq/km).

The researchers concluded that over the course of all our deep sea exploration, we have only observed between 0.0006 to 0.001% of the deep seafloor since 1958.

These estimates are based only upon seafloor observations from accessible records however, and the researchers note that oil and gas and telecommunication companies may have explored much more of the seafloor, but not made these records public.

Deep-sea dive activity has been concentrated in a small number of locations, particularly Monterey Bay, USA, Hawai’i, USA, Suruga and Sagami Bays, Japan, and New Zealand. (Image credit: Ocean Discovery League)

""As we face accelerated threats to the deep ocean — from climate change to potential mining and resource exploitation — this limited exploration of such a vast region becomes a critical problem for both science and policy,"" study lead author Katy Croff Bell , president of the nonprofit organization Ocean Discovery League and National Geographic Explorer, said in the statement.

""We need a much better understanding of the deep ocean's ecosystems and processes to make informed decisions about resource management and conservation,"" she said.

Additionally, they found that 65% of all these observations of the deep seafloor had been carried out within 200 nautical miles (230 miles) of the coast of the U.S., Japan, or New Zealand, and 97% of recorded deep-sea dives had been performed by only five countries: the U.S., Japan, New Zealand, France, and Germany.

The researchers also noted that geomorphological features like ridges and canyons saw a disproportionate amount of exploration, compared to areas such as abyssal plains and seamounts.

""If the scientific community were to make all assumptions about terrestrial ecosystems from observations of 0.001% of [the entire land area of Earth], it would equate to an assessment area … smaller than the land area of Houston,"" the authors wrote in the paper.

The bias in areas of the ocean floor that have been explored, and by whom, further limits our understanding of the entire seafloor, the researchers added. The researchers express a need for a more global effort to explore a wider range of the ocean floor and its features in order to truly understand and protect this little-known environment.

""Deep-sea exploration led by scientists and local communities is crucial to better understanding the planet's largest ecosystem,"" Miller said. ""If we have a better understanding of our ocean, we are better able to conserve and protect it."""|"Scientists have revealed how much of the vast deep ocean floor humankind has observed, and it's a staggeringly small amount.

The moon will slide in front of the red supergiant star Antares on May 13, briefly blocking its light just a day after reaching its full ""Flower Moon"" phase.

Because the moon is relatively close to Earth, its apparent position against the background stars shifts depending on your location. That means the occultation, when the moon covers Antares, won't be visible everywhere.

Instead, skywatchers in a a handful of southern hemisphere countries including Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, and Brazil, will see the full show according to stargazing site in-the-sky.org . The exact timings and duration of the occultation will differ depending on your location, so be sure to check in-the-sky.org for information tailored to your locale.

In the U.S., skywatchers will be treated to an altogether different celestial show. On May 13, bright Antares will rise to the left of the waning gibbous moon in the southeastern sky, with just a few degrees of separation between the two celestial bodies. Moonrise will occur at 9:33 p.m. EDT (0133 GMT on May 14) for viewers in New York, for example, who will see Antares glowing to its lower left. As the night progresses, the pair will climb higher, with Antares moving above the moon by the time they set in the early morning hours.

Antares is also known as the ""heart of the scorpion"", owing to its position at the core of the constellation Scorpius. It is about 700 times the diameter of our sun, yet only nine times as massive, according to the European Southern Observatory, giving it a remarkably low density. The star is nearing the end of its life and will eventually explode in a brilliant supernova.

Of course, the moon and Antares won't be the only celestial sights on May 13. The bright star Arcturus will be visible almost directly above the lunar disk at moonrise, while Vega shines in the east and the Big Dipper hovers near the zenith, pointing the way to Polaris.

Mars will appear in the constellation Cancer in the western sky, while Jupiter will lurk close to the horizon, setting just a few hours after the sun.

Many insects can see well in the dark because of their unique array of eyes. These compound eyes are made up of many small units called ommatidia, each with its own tiny lens. Each ommatidium collects light from a different angle, allowing insects to take in information from multiple directions all at once. They also use a process called “temporal summation,” which means they gather light over a short period to create a clearer picture in low light. This gives them fast and highly sensitive vision.

Because their eyes work in parallel, insects can quickly spot and follow moving objects — like prey or threats — even when it’s dark. By collecting light over time, their eyes become more sensitive to low-light environments.

According to a study published in the journal Science Advances, researchers at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) were inspired by the visual structure of insect eyes and developed a camera that works in a similar way.

Designed by a research team led by Professors Ki-Hun Jeong and Min H. Kim, the bio-inspired camera is incredibly thin — less than one millimeter thick — and compact, yet it can record 9,120 FPS and still produce clear images in the dark.

The camera, called the high-speed, high-sensitivity microlens array camera (HS-MAC), mimics the design of insect eyes. Instead of using a single lens to take one picture at a time, it uses many tiny lenses to capture different parts of a scene at different moments. These are then stitched together to produce sharp, clear videos — even in very low light.

“The research team adopted an approach similar to insect vision, utilizing multiple optical channels and temporal summation,” the researchers write in a press release. “Unlike traditional monocular camera systems, the bio-inspired camera employs a compound-eye-like structure that allows for the parallel acquisition of frames from different time intervals.”

According to a report by Interesting Engineering, this parallel acquisition helps the camera gather more light, improving its sensitivity even when capturing fast-moving objects. Rather than capturing each frame entirely separately, the camera records frames with slight temporal overlap. This method allows light to accumulate over time, enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio.

A stronger signal-to-noise ratio means the images are sharper and more accurate, which is particularly important in dim lighting. Interesting Engineering reports that the researchers demonstrated that their camera could detect objects up to 40 times dimmer than what conventional high-speed cameras are capable of seeing.

Their “channel-splitting” method greatly improved the camera’s speed, enabling frame rates that are thousands of times faster than those achievable with typical image sensors used in device manufacturing. To maintain image clarity, the team applied a “compressed image restoration” algorithm that effectively reduces motion blur.

Here's how to get the best views.|2025-05-13 11:00:00+00:00|"The bright band of the Milky Way is about to make its first great appearance of the year in the Northern Hemisphere.

There are few more impressive sights than the arc of the Milky Way spanning the night sky, but skywatchers don't always know exactly how, when and where to see it. In fact, one-third of humanity — and 80% of Americans — cannot see it .

The reason is light pollution, with the sky's brightness increasing by between 7% and 10% per year between 2011 and 2023, according to a 2023 study published in the journal Science . As a result, if you want to see the Milky Way, you'll need to be as far away from light pollution as possible. Good options include a Dark Sky Place or somewhere that looks dark on a light pollution map .

Although the Milky Way can be seen in some form for about eight months of the year, the galaxy's bright core becomes easier to see — and gets higher in the sky — as of May as seen from midlatitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, which includes the entire continental United States and the most populated parts of Canada.

According to the Milky Way photography website Capture The Atlas , ""Milky Way season"" runs from February to October, usually between midnight and 5 a.m. local time, though your location and the phase of the moon matter a lot. During May, the period between the last quarter moon on May 20 and the new moon on May 30 is the time to look for the Milky Way.

Even if you have a clear, moonless night, the viewing window is further restricted by when the galaxy's bright core rises from your location. The key is to find out when the Summer Triangle — a shape formed by three bright stars — becomes visible. This vast asterism of Deneb in the constellation Cygnus, Vega in Lyra and Altair in Aquila sits across the Milky Way. If it's above the horizon, you have a good chance of spotting it. Between May 20 and May 30, the Summer Triangle will be up in the east at midnight and higher in the southeast by 3 a.m. local time.

[Music]

SAMIR PATEL: Sometimes I imagine human knowledge is a huge, convoluted membrane floating in space. And on one side is what we know. The whole of human scientific inquiry. And on the other, the vast unknown and, in some cases, the completely unknowable. Over time, that membrane grows in all sorts of weird ways, and that’s where we at Quanta Magazine come in. I’m Samir Patel, the editor in chief.

At Quanta we report from this frontier to bring you a greater understanding of the latest advances in basic or fundamental science and math, from astrophysics and quantum computing, to molecular biology and classic unsolved math problems.

Quanta’s been doing this for more than a decade across thousands of stories and videos and yes, podcasts. We have the Quanta Science Podcast, which has translated many of our stories into audio form and The Joy of Why, where mathematician Steven Strogatz and astrophysicist Janna Levin talk to specialists about their work.

And today we’re launching something new, The Quanta Podcast, a weekly show where I will be speaking with the editors and writers behind the magazine to offer another perspective on physics, math, biology and computer science.

First off, if you’ve been a fan of the Quanta Science Podcast, don’t despair. It’s going to continue here. Those are “audio edition” episodes, stories that we have on our site, and we’re going to continue to do them as “audio edition” episodes running every two weeks.

As we learn more, we continue to have even more questions, and that’s where we live at Quanta Magazine.

I’ve been a science journalist for about 20 years. I’ve worked at magazines and websites, and one of the first things I noticed when I started as Quanta’s second editor in chief, was just how inspirational, dedicated, interesting and eloquent our staff is when they talk about the subjects that they cover. This podcast is really inspired by the conversations we’ve had in meetings, over coffee, at happy hour. For me, it adds a whole new dimension to our work, and I want to share some of that energy with you each week.

For this trailer episode, I want to introduce you to one of those people, our executive editor, Michael Moyer, a very accomplished science journalist who has been with Quanta since almost the very beginning. We’re going to talk a little about what Quanta covers, how it’s changed over time and our latest big project. Michael, welcome.

MICHAEL MOYER: Hey, so excited to be here.

PATEL: How long have you been at Quanta?

MOYER: I’ve been at Quanta since the fall of 2014.

PATEL: So, when you started what was Quanta, what was it then and how has it changed over the years?

MOYER: Right. So Quanta at the time was very small. I came on, I was the fourth staff member. There were two writers, and then the founding editor in chief, Tom Lin. I came on from Scientific American magazine where I was the physics editor at the time, and I had been talking with Tom Lin here, and he had this editorial job open, and Quanta was known mostly for doing physics-type stuff at the time. But he brings me on, my first day in the office, he says: “Congratulations, you’re now our biology editor.”

PATEL: Okay, bait and switch.

MOYER: And I’m like… yeah. But it was wonderful because I got to learn a lot about biology. We had a wonderful writer at the time, Emily Singer, who herself did know a lot about biology and she was able to teach me these things. So, over the years — you know, I’m not formally trained in mathematics, right? — but I’ve had the privilege of being able to work with our mathematics writers and editors. And in doing so, I’ve been able to learn all these fascinating questions that people are really into. But then as now we were dedicated to covering fundamental science, basic science and mathematics, which not a lot of people did. And we’ve kind of really kept that focus over the past decade that I’ve been here.

PATEL: To the fresh listener, basic science, fundamental science… what does that mean?

MOYER: So, that’s as opposed to applied science. So, the thinking was in starting Quanta Magazine, that there’s a lot of coverage out there about things that can be used in the world for good, which is great. A lot of coverage on medicine, right? A lot of coverage of technology, a lot of coverage of engineering, and kind of how science is being used to improve people’s lives. All that is wonderful, but we existed and started to complement that and not to reproduce it. So what we do is basic science. It’s the fundamental questions people have about the rules by which the universe works, is the way I think about it.

So in physics, it’s what is going on at quantum scales? How do we reconcile quantum mechanics, which is the theories at the very small with, Einstein’s theory of gravity, which works on very large scales. Those two theories don’t play well with each other. And so there’s a lot of scientists who are really curious about how to make them work. It’s the biggest mystery in physics right now. We do a lot of stories, as you said about molecular biology, about evolution. What are the rules through which evolution through natural selection works? So, we kind of cover what I feel is really just curiosity-driven science. People who just want to understand these kind of fundamental rules better.

PATEL: That’s the way I’m often describing it to people, because we use the term like “basic science” in another context, right that’s like, oh, that’s science 101.

MOYER: Right.

PATEL: But that’s not what this is. This is science at the very base levels of our understanding of how anything in the world or the universe or life works.

AI is still a “Black Box,” researchers still don’t know how large language models actually work. James O’Brien for Quanta Magazine

MOYER: So when you described it as this membrane that stretches out, that’s a metaphor that I’ve used over the years, which I love. And I love it because that intersection between what we know and what we don’t know, right, his membrane is always kind of shifting and expanding over time, nd as this membrane expands the division, the borderline actually gets larger, right? It’s like a circle getting larger and larger and larger. So as we learn more, we continue to have even more questions, and that’s where we live at Quanta Magazine.

PATEL: We’re, you know, certainly doing something that feels to me very different and distinct from what other places are doing. Why do you think that something like this podcast feels like a good next kind of evolutionary step for the way we communicate with our Quanta readers?

MOYER: Well as you say, I mean, my colleagues here are amazing, right? They’re some of the most intelligent, most curious people you’ll ever meet. They really are dedicated to what they do, and every time I talk with them, I end up learning new things.

PATEL: They have this knack — I think for, in the written story, but also when we’re talking — for making these, sometimes pretty esoteric, complex, challenging topics feel new and fresh and wonderful. And so that’s why I’m excited to do this, too. Now our math writers and editors, and our biology writers and editors, everybody actually from our art staff to our audience staff, took part in a new project that we actually launched the other day. This is separate from the podcast. Can you tell me a little bit more about this thing that we just did?

MOYER: So, the other day we came out with a really huge project that we’ve been working on for a long time. It’s called “Science, Promise and Peril in the Age of AI.” And what we really wanted to do was look at the way that AI is intersecting with science and what we do, basic science and mathematics, in a really complex and interesting way. Science is obviously why AI exists, right? And not just for the obvious reasons of, because computer scientists came up with it, but it has its roots in not just neuroscience and the way that people have thought about the brain, but also in fundamental physics theories, going back all the way to the ‘80s.

But at the same time now, we’re having this feedback effect where AI is really changing the way that science is being done in a lot of different areas. Right? It’s not just that people are using ChatGPT to do literature reviews or anything like that. It’s that they’re now using generative AI to come up with new questions to ask in science. They’re coming up with new ways to think about how we might do mathematical proofs, right? And they’re really leading to a lot of soul searching in science and a lot of thinking about what science is going to be and how it’s going to change over the next five to ten years.

PATEL: This really feels like kind of an important sort of forward-looking moment for this because so many people interact with AI on a daily basis now. It’s easy when you’re reading science news to see all the different ways, like, oh, they’re using AI in this project, they’re using AI in that project. Just last year, two of the Nobel prizes were both very closely related to AI and demonstrate the two sides of that, right? Where one of them was given for the fundamental science, which was physics that led to the development of neural networks and the other one, for an application in biology and protein folding that shows exactly how it’s changing the field.

This really feels like a forward-looking moment… a demonstration of what fundamental science means, and something that’s actually altering fundamental science in really interesting ways.

So I think this seems like a great opportunity for us to take a bit of a step back and think about, okay, what does this actually mean for the way that people do science? It’s a demonstration of what fundamental science means, and then something that’s actually altering fundamental science in really interesting ways. Math, too.

So, Michael, what was the most surprising, craziest thing you learned in the course of working on this package of stories?

MOYER: So, I really enjoyed learning about what’s called interpretability research. And what interpretability is the way that researchers are trying to figure out what’s going on inside a neural network. The things that power ChatGPT and image generators and all sorts of things that we have today. And inside this neural network, we have, many, many interconnected what are called neurons. In reality, they’re just little mathematical functions, but they all have relationships with one another, and the output of one goes into the input for the other, and they exist in many different layers. And out of this complicated structure and with enough training data, you’re able to get these really amazing behaviors. But what is actually happening inside to make these amazing behaviors come out on the outside is still very much a mystery.

PATEL: We called an entire section of this package, the “Black Box” because that’s often the analogy people use. And I think people might be surprised that we actually don’t know how ChatGPT or some of these image generation models work inside. They’re doing things that surprise us.

MOYER: Right. And they’re doing all these things that surprise us, despite the fact that we can go in — and interpretability researchers really can go in — and look and see, okay, what every little neuron is doing. This is an ability that every neuroscientist would kill for, right? To be able to have a full map of the brain with every strength of every connection between every neuron in the brain. But even though we have it, it still doesn’t get us anywhere closer to really being able to solve this problem of how all these interconnected mathematical functions end up giving us something like ChatGPT.

So I was really surprised to learn that there are ways that you could then go in and not just look at what individual neurons are doing, but actually start tweaking each one, right? Playing with the knobs and then seeing what the output is on the other side. And by doing that, being able to create some sort of a map, right, of what’s going on and how these single little things when put together in a complicated enough manner, are able to emerge with this really incredible behavior.

PATEL: And that’s a really fundamental way that science is often conducted when you have a complicated system or when you have a bunch of circuit breakers in your house; you turn off one and see if it turned off the hallway light. But doing this over the billions of digital neurons, parameters, whatever it is, is inside these AIs, is what they’re doing to try and get to another level of interpretability.

MOYER: I mean, there’s an old saying in physics that “more is different,” right? And what that means is when you get a complicated enough system, the same rules that you were using to look at one or two or three particles no longer apply; that you have to have new sets of rules and new understandings. And right now, they’re just trying to build up that understanding piece by piece.

PATEL: And I think that readers, when they look at this package, will piece by piece, get a bigger, deeper understanding, not just of how AI is changing the sciences, but really how it works, how it came about, the fundamental science that contributed to it.

So, our first episode, coming on May 20th, we’re going dig a little deeper with one of our writers into one of these stories that’s in this package. I’m very excited in the coming weeks to talk to just about everybody that we’ve got here. So, Michael, thank you for joining us. I’m looking forward to the next one.

Inside a laboratory nestled above the mist of the forests of south Dakota, scientists are searching for the answer to one of science's biggest questions: why does the Universe exist?

They are in a race for the answer with a separate team of Japanese scientists – who are several years ahead.

The current theories of astronomy can't explain why the planets, stars and galaxies came into existence. Both teams are building detectors that study a sub-atomic particle called a neutrino in the hope of finding answers.

US scientists are hoping the answer lies deep underground, in the aptly named Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (Dune).

The scientists travel 1,500 metres below the surface into three vast underground caverns. Such is the scale that construction crews and their bulldozers seem like small plastic toys by comparison.

Dune's science director Dr Jaret Heise describes the giant caves as ""cathedrals to science"".

Dr Heise has been involved the construction of these caverns for nearly ten years. They seal Dune off from the noise and radiation from the world above. Now, Dune is now ready for the next stage.

""We are poised to build the detector that will change our understanding of the Universe with instruments that will be deployed by a collaboration of 1,500 scientists who are eager to answer the question of why we exist,"" he says.

When the Universe was created two kinds of particles were created: matter – from which stars, planets and everything around us are made – and, in equal amounts, antimatter, matter's exact opposite.

Theoretically the two should have cancelled each other out, leaving nothing but a big burst of energy. And yet, here we – as matter – are.

[BBC]

Scientists believe that the answer to understanding why matter won – and we exist – lies in studying a particle called the neutrino and its antimatter opposite, the anti-neutrino.

They will be firing beams of both kinds of particles from deep underground in Illinois to the detectors at South Dakota, 800 miles away.

This is because as they travel, neutrinos and anti-neutrinos change ever so slightly.

The scientists want to find out whether those changes are different for the neutrinos and anti-neutrinos. If they are, it could lead them to the answer of why matter and anti-matter don't cancel each other out.

Dune is an international collaboration, involving 1,400 scientists from thirty countries. Among them is Dr Kate Shaw from Sussex University, who told me that the discoveries in store will be ""transformative"" to our understanding of the Universe and humanity's view of itself.

""It is really exciting that we are here now with the technology, with the engineering, with the computer software skills to really be able to attack these big questions,"" she said.

A temple to science: Japan's new lab will be a bigger better version of its existing Super K neutrino detector [Kamioka/ICRR/Tokyo University]

Half a world away, Japanese scientists are using shining golden globes to search for the same answers. In all their splendour, look like a temple to science. The scientists are building Hyper K - which will be a bigger and better version of their existing neutrino detector, Super K.

The Japanese-led team will be ready to turn on their neutrino beam in less than two years, several years earlier than the American project. Just like Dune, Hyper K is an international collaboration. Dr Mark Scott of Imperial College, London believes his team is in pole position to make one of the biggest ever discoveries about the origin of the Universe.

""We switch on earlier and we have a larger detector, so we should have more sensitivity sooner than Dune,"" he says.

Having both experiments running together means that scientists will learn more than they would with just one, but, he says, ""I would like to get there first!""

But Dr Linda Cremonesi, of Queen Mary University of London, who works for the US project, says that getting there first may not give the Japanese-led team the full picture of what is really going on.

""There is an element of a race, but Hyper K does not have yet all of the ingredients that they need to understand if neutrinos and anti-neutrinos behave differently"".

The race may be on, but the first results are only expected in a few years' time. The question of just what happened at the beginning of time to bring us into existence remains a mystery – for now."|"They are in a race for the answer with a separate team of Japanese scientists – who are several years ahead.

Like other crew members on the space station, Mr. Pettit conducted experiments, talked with students and exercised for hours to maintain his health and to stave off loss of bone density. But the most eye-catching work he performed in orbit was his photography.

Most people on Earth will never get a chance to go to space. “I could try to give them a glimpse through my imagery,” Mr. Pettit said during a news conference a couple of weeks after his return.

Mr. Pettit noted that hard-core photographers always want to have a camera in hand. “I could look out the window and just enjoy the view,” he said. “But when I’m looking out the window, just enjoying the view, it’s like, ‘Oh, wow, a meteor. Oh, wow. Look at that. Man, there’s a flash there. What’s that?’ And, ‘Oh, look at that, a volcano going off.’ It’s like, ‘OK, where’s my camera? I got to record that.’”

244|https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/13/ai_junk_science_papers/|AI paper mills are swamping science with garbage studies|2025-05-13 00:00:00|"A report from a British university warns that scientific knowledge itself is under threat from a flood of low-quality AI-generated research papers.

The research team from the University of Surrey notes an ""explosion of formulaic research articles,"" including inappropriate study designs and false discoveries, based on data cribbed from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) nationwide health database.

The study, published in PLOS Biology, a nonprofit publisher of open-access journals, found that many post-2021 papers used ""a superficial and oversimplified approach to analysis."" These often focused on a single variable while ignoring more realistic, multi-factor explanations of links between health conditions and potential causes, along with some cherry-picked narrow data subsets without justification.

""We've seen a surge in papers that look scientific but don't hold up under scrutiny – this is 'science fiction' using national health datasets to masquerade as science fact,"" states Matt Spick, a lecturer in health and biomedical data analytics at Surrey University, and one of the authors of the report.

""The use of these easily accessible datasets via APIs, combined with large language models, is overwhelming some journals and peer reviewers, reducing their ability to assess more meaningful research – and ultimately weakening the quality of science overall,"" he added.

The report notes that AI-ready datasets, such as NHANES, can open up new opportunities for data-driven research, but also lead to the risk of potential data exploitation by what it calls ""paper mills"" – entities that churn out questionable scientific papers, often for paying clients seeking confirmation of an existing belief.

Surrey Uni's work involved a systematic literature search going back ten years to retrieve potentially formulaic papers covering NHANES data, and analyzing these for telltale statistical approaches or study design.

The team identified and retrieved 341 reports published across a number of different journals. It found that over the last three years, there has been a rapid rise in the number of publications analyzing single-factor associations between predictors (independent variables) and various health conditions using the NHANES dataset. An average of four papers per year were published between 2014 and 2021, increasing to 33, 82, and 190 in 2022, 2023, and the first ten months of 2024, respectively.

Also noted is a change in the origins of the published research. From 2014 to 2020, just two out of 25 manuscripts had a primary author affiliation in China. Between 2021 and 2024, this rose to 292 out of 316 manuscripts.

The report says this jump in single-factor associative research means there is a corresponding increase in the risk of misleading findings being introduced to the wider body of scientific literature.

For example, it says that some well-known multifactorial health issues are analyzed as single-factor studies, citing depression, cardiovascular disease, and cognitive function – all recognized as multifactorial – being investigated using simplistic, single-factor approaches in some of the papers reviewed.

To combat this, the team sets out a number of suggestions, including that editors and reviewers at scientific journals should regard single-factor analysis of conditions known to be complex and multifactorial as a ""red flag"" for potentially problematic research.

Providers of datasets should also take steps including API keys and application numbers to prevent data dredging, an approach already used by the UK Biobank, the report says. Publications referencing such data should be made to include an auditable account number as a condition of access.

Another suggestion is that full dataset analysis should be made mandatory, unless using data subsets can be justified.

""We're not trying to block access to data or stop people using AI in their research – we're asking for some common sense checks,"" said Tulsi Suchak, a post-graduate researcher at the University of Surrey and lead author of the study. ""This includes things like being open about how data is used, making sure reviewers with the right expertise are involved, and flagging when a study only looks at one piece of the puzzle.""

This isn't the first time the issue has come to light. Last year, US publishing house Wiley discontinued 19 scientific journals overseen by its Hindawi subsidiary that were publishing reports churned out by AI paper mills.

It is also part of a wider problem of AI-generated content appearing online and in web searches that can be difficult to distinguish from reality. Dubbed ""AI slop,"" this includes fake pictures and entire video sequences of celebrities and world leaders, but also fake historical photographs and AI-generated portraits of historical figures appearing in search results as if they were genuine.

Truly, AI is the gift that keeps on giving. ®"|"A report from a British university warns that scientific knowledge itself is under threat from a flood of low-quality AI-generated research papers.

According to newly published research, clues to the formation of a mountain range the size of the Alps tucked away below Antarctic ice are being revealed, offering geologists a unique glimpse at the processes behind their formation.

The Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains, initially discovered by Soviet scientists during an expedition in 1958, have puzzled researchers for decades. Now, these massive features beneath Antarctica’s frozen surface, which were formed long ago during the birth of the supercontinent Gondwana, are finally revealing their secrets, as reported in a new study that sheds new light on the geological forces that helped to shape and ultimately stabilize the heart of Earth’s southernmost continent.

Secrets Below Antarctic Ice

While many of Antarctica’s mountain ranges are only partially covered by the thick ice that shields the continent, the Gamburtsev Mountains remain entirely concealed beneath the highest part of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet.

Soviet scientists first reported the discovery of these mountains using seismic techniques during a 1958 expedition. This expedition revealed an extensive mountain range comparable to the European Alps, albeit one that is entirely hidden below Antarctica’s frozen surface. The origins of this massive hidden mountain range quickly became one of the greatest unsolved mysteries of Earth’s ancient tectonic past.

“For scientists, it’s deeply puzzling,” researchers Nathan Daczko and Jacqueline Halpin recently wrote at The Conversation. “How could such a massive mountain range form and still be preserved in the heart of an ancient, stable continent?”

The Gamburtsev Mountains: A Geological Mystery

Mountain ranges normally form within the areas where tectonic plates collide. This fundamental reality points to one of the most intriguing mysteries about the Gamburtsev Mountains: the fact that East Antarctica has been tectonically stable now for hundreds of millions of years.

The apparent contradiction between known tectonic activity underlying mountain formation and the stability Antarctica has seen for eons led to many questions about how such a large mountain range could not only form, but also survive in an area with no signs of active tectonic collisions.

Now, in a study by Daczko and Halpin, the authors suggest that the origins of the Gamburtsev Mountains can be traced back more than 500 million years, to when ancient continental masses collided to form Gondwana.

“Our findings offer fresh insight into how mountains and continents evolve over geological time,” the authors recently wrote. “They also help explain why Antarctica’s interior has remained remarkably stable for hundreds of millions of years.”

According to Halpin and Daczko, millions of years ago, partially molten rock flows beneath the continent’s surface led to a thickening and uplifting of the crust. Eventually, the thickened crust collapsed beneath its own weight, resulting from a process known as gravitational spreading. However, a dense root of crust still remained anchored within the Earth’s mantle, which preserved the range.

Reconstructing the Geologic Past

In their study, the scientists analyzed zircon grains embedded in sandstone deposits found in the Prince Charles Mountains, which are a great distance from the Gamburtsev Mountain range. Like veritable time capsules, these zircon deposits helped Halpin and Daczko determine that the Gamburtsev Mountains reached their peak height by around 580 million years ago, with deep crustal melting that ended slightly more recently by around 500 million years ago.

While most mountains are eroded over time by weather or reshaped by successive tectonic events, the Gamburtsev Mountains, by contrast, have remained largely untouched thanks to the protective shielding of the large quantities of ice above them.

Entombed within ice for most of their existence, the Gamburtsev Mountain range’s unique preservation makes it one of the best-preserved ancient mountain systems.

Going Beneath Antarctic Ice

Although their incredible preservation for eons makes them an ideal target for geologists’ study, sampling these deeply frozen mountains would be difficult since drilling through kilometers of ice would be extremely costly.

However, Halpin and Daczko note that recent fieldwork undertaken near the Denman Glacier revealed surface rocks that are believed to potentially be linked to the Gamburtsev range, which could allow scientists a rare opportunity to study the geology of what is arguably one of Earth’s most mysterious buried mountain ranges.

Such findings continue to reveal surprises about the hidden history of Earth’s southernmost continent, much of which remains inaccessible due to the large quantities of ice that cover it. In the future, as new ice-penetrating technologies and more advanced geological modeling become available, scientists hope to begin unraveling more of the secrets that remain frozen beneath Antarctica’s icy exterior.

“Antarctica remains a continent full of geological surprises,” the study’s authors recently wrote, “and the secrets buried beneath its ice are only beginning to be revealed.”

The team’s new study, “Gondwanan continental collision drives gravitational spreading and collapse of the ancestral East Antarctic mountains,” appeared in Earth and Planetary Science Letters.

A new study by scientists at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and several institutes across India and Saudi Arabia has reported 26 novel bacterial species growing inside cleanrooms associated with NASA space missions. These unknown and newly described species carry genetic traits associated with resilience to extreme environments such as those found in space, highlighting the importance of rigorous contamination control to prevent unintentional microbial transfer during space missions.

The work is published in the journal Microbiome.

Spacecraft are assembled in cleanrooms, which are highly specialized facilities engineered to maintain exceptionally low levels of dust and microorganisms. These controlled environments are extreme in their own right, with tightly regulated airflow, temperature, and humidity that inhibit microbial survival. However, some microorganisms—extremophiles—thrive in such environments.

""Our study aimed to understand the risk of extremophiles being transferred in space missions and to identify which microorganisms might survive the harsh conditions of space. This effort is pivotal for monitoring the risk of microbial contamination and safeguarding against unintentional colonization of exploring planets,"" explained King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) Professor Alexandre Rosado, the lead KAUST researcher on the project and a contributor to several NASA working groups on planetary protection and space microbiology.

The scientists did a comprehensive analysis of the microorganisms growing in the NASA cleanrooms, finding that many of the new species possessed genes that made them resilient to decontamination and radiation. Some of the discovered genes were associated with DNA repair, the detoxification of harmful molecules, and improved metabolism, all of which increased the species' survivability.

Moreover, these genes could lead to new biotechnologies that benefit food preservation and medicine.

""These findings not only raise important considerations for planetary protection but also open the door for biotechnological innovation,"" said Junia Schultz, a postdoctoral fellow at KAUST who was the first author of the study.

""Space travel provides an opportunity to study microorganisms that possess relevant stress-resistance genes. The genes identified in these newly discovered bacterial species could be engineered for applications in medicine, food preservation, and other industries.""

In addition, the study assists NASA with anticipating the type of bacteria astronauts will encounter on their space missions and in developing strategies to mitigate microbial contamination in cleanrooms.

Contrary to popular belief, neither Venus nor Mars holds this distinction. This revelation challenges decades of conventional astronomical wisdom and offers fascinating implications for future space exploration.

Mercury: our closest neighbor on average

Scientists from NASA and the U.S. Army‘s Engineering Research and Development Center have upended traditional understanding of planetary proximities. Using the innovative “point-circle method,” researchers have calculated average distances between planets over time rather than simply measuring closest approach points. Their findings revealed something unexpected: Mercury is, on average, closer to Earth than either Venus or Mars.

This discovery stems from Mercury’s rapid orbit around the Sun. Despite appearing distant at times, Mercury’s swift revolution means it spends more time on the same side of the solar system as Earth than other planets do. This proximity pattern remained hidden until researchers applied more sophisticated measurement techniques that account for orbital dynamics over extended periods.

The implications extend far beyond Mercury’s relationship with Earth. The research indicates that Mercury is actually the closest neighbor, on average, to every planet in our solar system—even distant Neptune. This perspective fundamentally reshapes how we conceptualize spatial relationships in our cosmic neighborhood and could influence future interplanetary exploration missions.

Journey time to Mercury: faster than you think

While 77 million kilometers—Mercury’s closest approach to Earth—seems vast by terrestrial standards, cosmic distances offer different perspectives. If we consider theoretical spacecraft capabilities similar to NASA’s Parker Solar Probe, reaching Mercury could take approximately five hours at maximum velocity. This revolutionary probe, designed to study our Sun, has achieved unprecedented speeds that transform our understanding of interplanetary travel potential.

The notion that humans could theoretically reach another planet within a half-day timeframe represents a paradigm shift in how we conceptualize space travel. While current technology doesn’t yet support passenger flights at such velocities, the mathematical possibility exists—much like how quantum computing breakthroughs have transformed what we once considered impossible in computational science.

Mercury’s extreme environmental conditions—temperatures ranging from -173°C to 427°C and lack of substantial atmosphere—currently make it inhospitable to human exploration. However, robotic missions like BepiColombo are gathering crucial data about this enigmatic world, following in the footsteps of earlier missions like MESSENGER, which revealed surprising evidence of water ice in permanently shadowed polar craters.

Challenging traditional astronomical wisdom

The misunderstanding about planetary proximities reveals how scientific assumptions can persist unchallenged for generations. Researchers attribute this misconception to “carelessness, ambiguity or group-think” among science communicators who perpetuated an incorrect hypothesis about average planetary distances.

This case demonstrates the importance of revisiting fundamental scientific concepts with new methodologies. Just as seemingly trivial observations have revealed profound cosmic mysteries, recalculating these basic spatial relationships has transformed our understanding of the solar system’s architecture.

The implications extend to various scientific disciplines. Astrobiologists must reconsider proximity factors when studying planetary development. Aerospace engineers might evaluate mission profiles differently knowing Mercury’s average proximity. Even educational materials worldwide require updates to correct this long-standing misconception.

These findings remind us that space observation requires multiple perspectives. While advanced telescopes reveal distant cosmic phenomena, sometimes the most surprising discoveries involve reassessing what we thought we already knew about our immediate cosmic neighborhood.

Reimagining our place in the solar system

This astronomical revelation invites us to reconsider our perception of cosmic proximities. The discovery that Mercury maintains the closest average distance to Earth challenges our Earth-centric view of the solar system and reminds us that orbital mechanics create complex spatial relationships that defy simple categorization.

As space agencies and private companies develop increasingly ambitious exploration plans, understanding these precise spatial relationships becomes crucial for efficient mission planning. Mercury’s newfound status as our closest planetary neighbor on average might influence future scientific priorities and resource allocation for solar system exploration.

This recalibration of our cosmic understanding demonstrates how science constantly evolves, sometimes overturning deeply held beliefs through methodological innovation. By measuring the average positions of planets throughout their orbits rather than focusing solely on closest approach points, researchers have provided a more accurate model of our dynamic solar system—one where Mercury occupies a more central role than previously recognized."|"Mercury, often overlooked in discussions about our cosmic neighborhood, has emerged as Earth’s closest planetary companion according to revolutionary calculations.

But suppose that this is not true. Suppose the law of gravity is simply an echo of something more fundamental: a byproduct of the universe operating under a computer-like code.

That is the premise of my latest research, published in the journal AIP Advances. It suggests that gravity is not a mysterious force that attracts objects towards one another, but the product of an informational law of nature that I call the second law of infodynamics.

It is a notion that seems like science fiction—but one that is based in physics and evidence that the universe appears to be operating suspiciously like a computer simulation. In digital technologies, right down to the apps in your phone and the world of cyberspace, efficiency is the key. Computers compact and restructure their data all the time to save memory and computer power. Maybe the same is taking place all over the universe?

Information theory, the mathematical study of the quantification, storage and communication of information, may help us understand what’s going on. Originally developed by mathematician Claude Shannon, it has become increasingly popular in physics and is used in a growing range of research areas.

In a 2023 paper, I used information theory to propose my second law of infodynamics. This stipulates that information “entropy”, or the level of information disorganisation, will have to reduce or stay static within any given closed information system. This is the opposite of the popular second law of thermodynamics, which dictates that physical entropy, or disorder, always increases.

Take a cooling cup of coffee. Energy flows from hot to cold until the temperature of the coffee is the same as the temperature of the room and its energy is minimum—a state called thermal equilibrium. The entropy of the system is a maximum at this point—with all the molecules maximally spread out, having the same energy. What that means is that the spread of energies per molecule in the liquid is reduced.

If one considers the information content of each molecule based on its energy, then at the start, in the hot cup of coffee, the information entropy is maximum and at equilibrium the information entropy is minimum. That’s because almost all molecules are at the same energy level, becoming identical characters in an informational message. So the spread of different energies available is reduced when there’s thermal equilibrium.

But if we consider just location rather than energy, then there’s lots of information disorder when particles are distributed randomly in space—the information required to keep pace with them is considerable. When they consolidate themselves together under gravitational attraction, however, the way planets, stars and galaxies do, the information gets compacted and more manageable.

In simulations, that’s exactly what occurs when a system tries to function more efficiently. So, matter flowing under the influence of gravity need not be a result of a force at all. Perhaps it is a function of the way the universe compacts the information that it has to work with.

Here, space is not continuous and smooth. Space is made up of tiny “cells” of information, similar to pixels in a photo or squares on the screen of a computer game. In each cell is basic information about the universe—where, say, a particle is–and all are gathered together to make the fabric of the universe.

If you place items within this space, the system gets more complex. But when all of those items come together to be one item instead of many, the information is simple again.

The universe, under this view, tends to naturally seek to be in those states of minimal information entropy. The real kicker is that if you do the numbers, the entropic “informational force” created by this tendency toward simplicity is exactly equivalent to Newton’s law of gravitation, as shown in my paper.

This theory builds on earlier studies of “entropic gravity” but goes a step further. In connecting information dynamics with gravity, we are led to the interesting conclusion that the universe could be running on some kind of cosmic software. In an artificial universe, maximum-efficiency rules would be expected. Symmetries would be expected. Compression would be expected. And law–that is, gravity—would be expected to emerge from these computational rules.

We may not yet have definitive evidence that we live in a simulation. But the deeper we look, the more our universe seems to behave like a computational process.

On March 28, 2025, the city of Mandalay, Myanmar was hit by a magnitude 7.7 earthquake which was felt as far away as Thailand, leaving at least 4,900 people dead.

""Originating along the Sagaing Fault, a 1,400-km-long [870-mile] dextral strike-slip boundary separating the Burma Microplate and Sunda Plate, the earthquake propagated a supershear rupture over 460 km [286 miles], with surface displacements exceeding 6 meters [20 feet],"" a paper on the earthquake explains. ""The shallow (10 km [6-mile] depth) strike-slip mechanism unleashed violent shaking (Modified Mercalli Intensity IX) across densely populated urban centers, including Mandalay, Sagaing, and Naypyidaw, while amplifying seismic energy in distant regions such as Bangkok, Thailand.""

A video, reportedly filmed near Thazi, Myanmar, appears to show the moment two blocks of earth move past each other. Focus on the background in the short video, and you will see the landscape slide around.

The video appears to show a strike slip fault, which can occur as two blocks of rock slip past each other.

""A fault is a fracture or zone of fractures between two blocks of rock. Faults allow the blocks to move relative to each other. This movement may occur rapidly, in the form of an earthquake - or may occur slowly, in the form of creep,"" the US Geological Survey explains, adding that the San Andreas Fault is an example of a right lateral slip fault.

""Faults may range in length from a few millimeters to thousands of kilometers. Most faults produce repeated displacements over geologic time. During an earthquake, the rock on one side of the fault suddenly slips with respect to the other. The fault surface can be horizontal or vertical or some arbitrary angle in between.""

Though the ""everything has a camera in it"" age has given us footage of earthquakes around the world, this appears to be the first example of a fault shift being caught in the act, or at least so dramatically.

""The focal mechanism analysis indicated that the earthquake resulted from strike-slip faulting at a shallow depth of 10 km [6 miles], consistent with rupture activity along the Sagaing Fault,"" the study continues.

""From the epicenter, the rupture propagated over 75 km [47 miles] to the north, terminating just south of Singu, while a more extensive rupture of 420 km [261 miles] occurred to the south, ending near Pyu. The most significant fault slip exceeding 1 meter [3 feet] was concentrated in the section between Singu and Oktwin. In contrast, regions beneath and south of Pyu experienced less than 1 meter of displacement.""

The team adds that the largest slip of 4.3 meters (14 feet) was recorded between Sagaing and Amarapura.

""The entire rupture process spanned just over 80 seconds, with the highest seismic moment release occurring approximately 30 seconds after initiation. The rupture velocity is believed to have exceeded the shear wave velocity, classifying the event as a supershear earthquake."""|"A video going around the Internet at the moment in geologist circles appears to show what might be the first ever fault movement caught on camera.

Could We Eventually Lose It?|2025-05-12 19:00:00|"The moon feels like a beautiful constant for many of us, there every night, but Earth’s satellite is actually slowly moving away from us, albeit very slowly.

By NASA’s calculations the moon is drifting away from our planet by about 1.5 inches every year. That’s not just tortoise vs. hare slow, NASA says that’s about the rate at which fingernails grow.

That slow movement means our days are slowly getting longer – one study found that the length of an average day has increased by about one millisecond every century since the late 1600s.

So how did NASA scientists even clock this slow-motion drift? It all started with the Apollo missions more than 50 years ago, when astronauts left reflective panels on the moon’s surface.

Since then, scientists have been shooting laser beams at the panels and recording the amount of time it takes for the light to come back to Earth. That’s how they were able to measure with such accuracy how fast the moon is retreating.

The slowly widening gap is caused by the gravitational tug-of-war between the two bodies. The moon’s gravitational pull causes our oceans to bulge toward it.

As NASA explains it, “Because Earth rotates on its axis faster than the Moon orbits it, the higher gravity from Earth’s bulge tries to speed up the Moon’s rotation. Meanwhile, the Moon is pulling on Earth and slowing the planet’s rotation. The friction that ensues from this tug-of-war forces the Moon into a wider orbit.”

That wider orbit is what creates the slowly growing distance between the moon and us each year.

So could we eventually lose the moon? The short answer is no.

NASA says that about 50 billion years from now, the moon would be so far away and its orbit so large that the Earth would tidally lock to the moon. The two bodies would stop moving away from each other. That means only half of our world (and whomever is left on it) would ever see the moon.

However, the sun would likely intervene long before that could happen. Scientists believe that in about 5 billion years, the sun will die, becoming a giant red star that obliterates both the moon and the Earth.

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:

Natural hydrogen naturally released at the Earth's surface from groundwater in rocks of the Canadian Shield. Credit: Stable Isotope Lab University of Toronto.

In the modern world, a reliable supply of hydrogen gas is vital for the function of society. Fertilizer produced from hydrogen contributes to the food supply of half the global population, and hydrogen is also a key energy component in many roadmaps to a carbon-neutral future, essential if we are to prevent the worst predictions of climate change.

Today, hydrogen is produced from hydrocarbons, with waste gases contributing to 2.4% of global CO 2 emissions. Demand for hydrogen is set to increase from 90 million metric tons in 2022 to 540 million metric tons in 2050, but it is vital that this hydrogen is not CO 2 emitting.

Production followed by the burial of waste CO 2 (""carbon sequestration"") or from renewable energy resources (wind or solar) are both future sources of hydrogen, but are not yet commercially competitive.

New research from the University of Oxford, in collaboration with Durham University and the University of Toronto, provides a solution. The work is published in the journal Nature Reviews Earth & Environment.

In the last billion years, enough hydrogen gas has been produced by Earth's continental crust to supply mankind's energy needs for at least 170,000 years. While a proportion of this has been lost, consumed, or is inaccessible today, the remaining hydrogen could offer a natural (and emission-free) source of this natural resource.

Until now, limited historical hydrogen sampling and measurement have restricted scientists' current understanding of where, and how much, hydrogen is located in the crust. An exploration recipe is critical to find accessible and commercially viable accumulations of natural geological hydrogen.

Study co-author, Professor Jon Gluyas (Durham University) notes, ""We have successfully developed an exploration strategy for helium and a similar 'first principles' approach can be taken for hydrogen.""

This research outlines the key ingredients needed to inform an exploration strategy to find different ""hydrogen systems."" This includes how much hydrogen is produced and the rock types and conditions these occur in, how the hydrogen migrates underground from these rocks, the conditions that allow a gas field to form, and the conditions that destroy the hydrogen.

Study co-author Professor Barbara Sherwood Lollar (University of Toronto) said, ""We know, for example, that underground microbes readily feast on hydrogen. Avoiding environments that bring them into contact with the hydrogen is important in preserving hydrogen in economic accumulations.""

The authors outline where understanding of these ingredients is strong, and highlight areas that need more work—such as rock reaction efficiencies and how geological histories can bring the right rocks together with the water that reacts with it.

Some sources of hydrogen gas, such as from Earth's mantle, have fueled much speculation and hyperbole—but this research shows that these are not viable sources. Instead, the authors showed that the ingredients for a complete hydrogen system can be found in a range of common geological settings within the crust.

Some of these can be geologically quite young, forming hydrogen ""recently"" (millions to tens of millions of years), others are truly ancient (hundreds of millions of years old)—but critically found globally.

Lead author Professor Chris Ballentine (University of Oxford, Department of Earth Sciences) said, ""Combining the ingredients to find accumulated hydrogen in any of these settings can be likened to cooking a soufflé—get any one of the ingredients, amounts, timing, or temperature wrong and you will be disappointed.

""One successful exploration recipe that is repeatable will unlock a commercially competitive, low-carbon hydrogen source that would significantly contribute to the energy transition—we have the right experience to combine these ingredients and find that recipe.""

Sub-Neptunes, planets smaller than gas giants and cooler than hot Jupiters, have long been elusive targets for astronomers. Despite being the most common type of exoplanet in our galaxy, they don’t exist in our own solar system, and until recently, we knew very little about them. Their relatively small size and cooler temperatures made them especially difficult to study — at least, until NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope changed the game.

Adding to the challenge, most sub-Neptunes are cloaked in thick clouds or hazes that block the chemical signatures of their atmospheres. But that’s exactly what makes the recent observation of TOI-421 b so exciting. With Webb’s powerful instruments, scientists were finally able to pierce the haze and reveal the planet’s atmospheric composition.

The findings raise big questions: Did TOI-421 b form differently than the cooler sub-Neptunes we’ve studied before? Could it represent a whole new class of hot, haze-free sub-Neptunes? Or are we simply beginning to uncover the incredible diversity of planets beyond our solar system? Thanks to Webb, researchers are now closer than ever to finding out.

Webb Space Telescope Lifts Veil on Common but Mysterious Type of Exoplanet

Although no sub-Neptunes orbit around our Sun, they are the most common type of exoplanet, or planet outside our solar system, that have been observed in the Milky Way. These compact, gas-rich worlds are often hidden beneath thick hazes, keeping their true nature out of reach—until now. Using the James Webb Space Telescope to examine the hot sub-Neptune TOI-421 b, scientists have begun to probe these planets in detail for the first time.

“I had been waiting my entire career for Webb so that we could meaningfully characterize the atmospheres of these smaller planets,” said principal investigator Eliza Kempton of the University of Maryland, College Park. “By studying their atmospheres, we’re getting a better understanding of how sub-Neptunes formed and evolved, and part of that is understanding why they don’t exist in our solar system.”

Sub-Neptunes: Common Yet Mysterious

Astronomers didn’t even know sub-Neptunes existed until NASA’s Kepler mission uncovered them over the past decade. Although a few times larger than Earth, they are far smaller than gas giants and usually cooler than hot Jupiters, making them difficult to study with earlier telescopes.

Before Webb, scientists had very little information on them. While sub-Neptunes are a few times larger than Earth, they are still much smaller than gas-giant planets and typically cooler than hot Jupiters, making them much more challenging to observe than their gas-giant counterparts.

A key finding prior to Webb was that most sub-Neptune atmospheres had flat or featureless transmission spectra. This means that when scientists observed the spectrum of the planet as it passed in front of its host star, instead of seeing spectral features – the chemical fingerprints that would reveal the composition of the atmosphere – they saw only a flat-line spectrum. Astronomers concluded from all of those flat-line spectra that at least certain sub-Neptunes were probably very highly obscured by either clouds or hazes.

A Hot, Haze-Free Candidate Emerges

“Why did we observe this planet, TOI-421 b? It’s because we thought that maybe it wouldn’t have hazes,” said Kempton. “And the reason is that there were some previous data that implied that maybe planets over a certain temperature range were less enshrouded by haze or clouds than others.”

That temperature threshold is about 1,070 degrees Fahrenheit. Below that, scientists hypothesized that a complex set of photochemical reactions would occur between sunlight and methane gas, and that would trigger the haze. But hotter planets shouldn’t have methane and therefore perhaps shouldn’t have haze.

The temperature of TOI-421 b is about 1,340 degrees Fahrenheit, well above the presumed threshold. Without haze or clouds, researchers expected to see a clear atmosphere – and they did!

A Surprising Finding

“We saw spectral features that we attribute to various gases, and that allowed us to determine the composition of the atmosphere,” said the University of Maryland’s Brian Davenport, a third-year Ph.D. student who conducted the primary data analysis. “Whereas with many of the other sub-Neptunes that had been previously observed, we know their atmospheres are made of something, but they’re being blocked by haze.”

The team found water vapor in the planet’s atmosphere, as well as tentative signatures of carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide. Then there are molecules they didn’t detect, such as methane and carbon dioxide. From the data, they can also infer that a large amount of hydrogen is in TOI-421 b’s atmosphere.

The lightweight hydrogen atmosphere was the big surprise to the researchers. “We had recently wrapped our mind around the idea that those first few sub-Neptunes observed by Webb had heavy-molecule atmospheres, so that had become our expectation, and then we found the opposite,” said Kempton. This suggests TOI-421 b may have formed and evolved differently from the cooler sub-Neptunes observed previously.

A Light, Hydrogen-Rich Atmosphere

The hydrogen-dominated atmosphere is also interesting because it mimics the composition of TOI-421 b’s host star. “If you just took the same gas that made the host star, plopped it on top of a planet’s atmosphere, and put it at the much cooler temperature of this planet, you would get the same combination of gases. That process is more in line with the giant planets in our solar system, and it is different from other sub-Neptunes that have been observed with Webb so far,” said Kempton.

Aside from being hotter than other sub-Neptunes previously observed with Webb, TOI-421 b orbits a Sun-like star. Most of the other sub-Neptunes that have been observed so far orbit smaller, cooler stars called red dwarfs.

Is TOI-421b emblematic of hot sub-Neptunes orbiting Sun-like stars, or is it just that exoplanets are very diverse? To find out, the researchers would like to observe more hot sub-Neptunes to determine if this is a unique case or a broader trend. They hope to gain insights into the formation and evolution of these common exoplanets.

A New Frontier for Exploration

“We’ve unlocked a new way to look at these sub-Neptunes,” said Davenport. “These high-temperature planets are amenable to characterization. So by looking at sub-Neptunes of this temperature, we’re perhaps more likely to accelerate our ability to learn about these planets.”

The team’s findings were published on May 5 in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is NASA’s most powerful space observatory, designed to explore the universe in unprecedented detail by observing infrared light. Launched in December 2021, it orbits around the Sun at a stable point known as Lagrange Point 2, about a million miles from Earth. Webb is equipped with a suite of advanced instruments that allow it to peer through cosmic dust, study the atmospheres of exoplanets, and look back over 13 billion years to observe the earliest galaxies and stars. As the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, Webb is transforming our understanding of the cosmos, from the origins of planets to the evolution of the universe itself.

By following a shape‑shifting protein through Arabidopsis roots, the team uncovered how brief clean‑up pulses let new branches form and help crops cope with tougher conditions.

Plant roots’ cellular clean‑up crew

Scientists at the University of Copenhagen mapped the pathway in living seedlings. They watched the transcription factor ARF7 vanish and return in predictable waves, each tied to a jump in the growth hormone auxin.

“Fasting has become popular as it seems to have a range of health‑promoting effects in humans, as periods without food cause the body to activate clean‑up processes to dispose of various waste products in cells,” explains Assistant Professor Eleazar Rodriguez from the Department of Biology, who led the study.

“We have proven that the same mechanism, which also exists in the plant kingdom, plays a vital role in the ability of plant roots to grow and absorb water and nutrients for the rest of the plant.”

The process relies on NBR1, a tag that guides used proteins toward a vacuole for breakdown. Each removal of ARF7 resets the signaling circuit so it can fire again a few hours later.

When autophagy slows, ARF7 accumulates, messages run long, and the root loses its usual rhythm.

Autophagy and auxin

Side branches normally form with steady precision. Roughly every four to six hours, auxin peaks at the root tip and switches on genes that mark a patch of tissue for future branching.

“The movement of a root is almost like watching a snake slithering forward in search of water and nourishment in the soil. And we can see that the heartbeat is strongest every time the root meanders forth,” says Rodriguez.

Using a luminescent reporter, the team confirmed that ARF7 cycles in step with those hormone pulses.

To investigate the significance of autophagy, the researchers developed a mutant Arabidopsis (thale cress) plant in which its autophagy was disabled which is shown on the right. With an enzyme from fire flies the researchers made it possible to distinguish the normal plant from the plant with its autophagy function disabled. The plant to the right has fewer light areas and thereby fewer potential places to grow new roots with it’s autophagy function turned off. Click image to enlarge.

The pattern resembles the circadian rhythms that guide leaf opening, yet it runs on its own schedule and focuses solely on building the hidden half of the plant.

When autophagy stalls

The group then disabled key autophagy genes to test the pathway’s limits. Mutant seedlings produced fewer lateral roots and soaked up less water.

“When we disrupted the plant’s autophagy, there was waste everywhere, and we were able to detect the ARF7 protein among the waste,” says Rodriguez.

Microscopy revealed swollen vacuoles packed with debris. Growth zones that once cleared their protein stockpile before each auxin wave now stayed loaded, leaving no room for a fresh signal. The result was a sparse, inefficient root system.

Why does any of this matter?

Because the recycling toolkit is shared across flowering plants, the findings open new options for breeders and for companies developing microbial soil additives.

Numerous methods to change the genetic characteristics of plants are available today. These can be used to get plants to develop longer roots, faster, and in doing so, become more resistant to droughts or floods.

“One of the methods enlists the help of bacteria that live in symbiosis with the plant and can cause the plant to change its growth pattern. Several companies in Denmark are working on this right now,” explains Ph.D. student Jeppe Ansbøl, who co‑authored the study.

Tuning autophagy or adjusting NBR1 tags could let roots chase moisture deeper in the soil and capture stray fertilizer before it washes away, improving harvests without extra inputs.

Autophagy makes stronger roots

“The more roots the plants have, the more water and nutrients they can take up, so the plants grow better, faster,” Rodriquez summarized.

“We’re heavily dependent on plants because they feed us, extract CO2 from the atmosphere and produce the oxygen we breathe. As such, it is extremely important to understand them fully, to which end we have just taken a big step forward.”

Pilot plots in Denmark are already testing these ideas under shifting rain patterns. Early observations hint that crops with tweaked recycling bounce back more quickly after both saturation and dry spells.

What next for crops and autophagy?

Upcoming work will examine whether other auxin response factors move through the same recycling pathway and how changes in light, temperature, or soil chemistry adjust the schedule.

Studies in mosses and liverworts, which split from flowering plants roughly 400 million years ago, may reveal how old the link between autophagy and development really is.

For farmers, a timely cellular tidy‑up could translate into sturdier yields. By keeping root cells clear of clutter, plants gain the freedom to build the networks they need to thrive in a climate that rarely sits still.

The full study was published in the journal EMBO Reports.

An extraordinary experiment on mice and leaves from two different plant species has uncovered direct physical evidence of an eerie 'biophoton' phenomenon ceasing on death, suggesting all living things – including humans – could literally glow with health, until we don't.

The findings might seem a little fringe at first glance. It's hard not to associate scientific investigations into biological electromagnetic emissions with debunked and paranormal claims of auras and discharges surrounding living organisms.

What's more, even in theory, visible wavelengths of light emitted by biological processes ought to be so faint that it's easily swamped by the intense shine of ambient electromagnetic waves in the environment and radiant heat generated by our metabolism, making it a challenge to accurately track across an entire body.

Still, University of Calgary physicist Vahid Salari and his team have claimed to observe just that – an ultraweak photon emission (UPE) produced by several living animals in strong contrast with their non-living bodies, as well as in a handful of plant leaves.

The science behind biophotons is from a controversial idea itself. A variety of biological processes clearly generate bright displays of light in the form of chemiluminescence. And for decades the spontaneous sputtering of light waves anywhere from 200 to 1,000 nanometers in length has been recorded from less obvious reactions among a wide diversity of living cells, from cow heart tissue to bacterial colonies.

A strong contender for the source of this radiation is the effect of various reactive oxygen species that living cells produce when troubled by stresses such as heat, poisons, pathogens, or lack of nutrients.

Given enough molecules of hydrogen peroxide, for example, materials like fats and proteins can undergo transformations that kick their electrons into high gear and spit out a suitably energetic photon or two as they settle back into place.

Having a means of remotely monitoring the stress of individual tissues in whole human or animal patients, or even among crops or bacterial samples, could provide technicians and medical specialists with a powerful, non-invasive research or diagnostics tool.

To determine whether the process could be scaled from isolated tissues to entire living subjects, the researchers used electron-multiplying charge-coupled device and charge-coupled device cameras to compare the faintest of emissions from whole mice – first alive, then dead.

Four immobilized mice were individually placed in a dark box and imaged for an hour, before being euthanized and imaged for another hour. They were warmed to body temperature even after death, to keep heat from being a variable.

The researchers found they could capture individual photons in the visible band of light popping out of the mouse cells before and after death. The difference in the numbers of these photons was clear, with a significant drop in UPE in the measurement period after they were euthanized.

A process carried out on thale cress (Arabidopsis thaliana) and dwarf umbrella tree (Heptapleurum arboricola) leaves revealed similarly bold results. Stressing the plants with physical injuries and chemical agents provided strong evidence that reactive oxygen species could in fact be behind the soft glow.

""Our results show that the injury parts in all leaves were significantly brighter than the uninjured parts of the leaves during all 16 hours of imaging,"" the researchers report.

The experiment encourages speculation that the faintest of ethereal glows produced by stressed cells may perhaps one day tell us whether we're in radiant health.

What's happening?

A team led by Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers determined that, with Earth's warming, space debris could accumulate enough to reduce the low Earth orbit area available for satellites by between a third and 82% by the year 2100, as the Associated Press detailed.

The reason for this, per the study published in Nature Sustainability in March, is that climatic changes high above ground could reduce the effectiveness of the upper atmosphere in clearing up space litter.

""Part of the greenhouse effect that warms the air near Earth's surface also cools the upper parts of the atmosphere where space starts and satellites zip around in low orbit,"" AP science writer Seth Borenstein explained. ""The cooling also makes the upper atmosphere less dense, which reduces the drag on the millions of pieces of human-made debris and satellites.""

Because of that drag, space trash normally gets pulled back toward Earth and burns up along the way. This cleanup effect weakens when the upper atmosphere is cooler and less dense.

Why is an increase in space debris concerning?

Orbiting debris endangers equipment that people on Earth depend on for numerous reasons.

""Rapid expansion in the utilization of satellites in low Earth orbit for communications, weather forecasting, navigation, defence and more has increased humanity's reliance on the long-term sustainability of this region,"" the study noted.

The AP reported that there are millions of pieces of space junk of about one-ninth of an inch or larger that can carry the impact of a bullet.

""A piece of space debris the size of a blueberry can create the impact of a falling anvil,"" per the Space Debris 101 page of The Aerospace Corporation, a company that tracks orbiting items.

""We rely on the atmosphere to clean up our debris,"" Will Parker, the study's lead author, told the AP. ""There's no other way to remove debris. It's trash. It's garbage. And there are millions of pieces of it.""

The researchers used modeling to calculate the satellite carrying capacity of low Earth orbit under different carbon pollution scenarios (with different abilities to burn up trash). Possibilities ranged widely, but the estimated reduction in capacity by 2100 was 82% under the worst-case scenario for the most useful part of the orbital space.

What's being done about space debris?

Scientists and space companies are exploring ways to clean up potentially costly space waste — or to minimize the creation of more.

Meanwhile, reducing the impacts of atmospheric pollution on space debris comes down to reducing that pollution. Under the researchers' better-case scenarios, carbon pollution is lower, and the atmosphere keeps burning space trash at a higher rate.

Reducing pollution carries with it the connected benefits of limiting other costs and risks to people and the planet that come with overheating at Earth's surface.

In addition to government and industry actions to reduce pollution, individuals can take actions big and small — from installing solar panels to finding ways to save money and energy at home.

256|https://www.earth.com/news/discovery-of-a-cretaceous-ostrich-mexidracon-longimanus-with-extremely-long-arms/|Discovery of a Cretaceous 'ostrich' with extremely long arms opens new dinosaur debate|2025-05-13 18:42:06|"A newly recognized dinosaur with extra-long arms has caused a stir in paleontology circles. It appears to have roamed what is now northern Mexico about 73 million years ago, leaving behind tantalizing clues about its life and habitat.

Dr. Claudia Inés Serrano-Brañas of the Smithsonian Institution led the team that analyzed the fossilized remains.

They identified it as an ornithomimid, a family of bird-like dinosaurs that often sported sleek bodies and slender limbs.

Understanding Mexidracon longimanus

Mexidracon longimanus stood around 10 feet from head to tail. It is described as having especially elongated forelimbs, giving it an unusual silhouette that sets it apart from other members of its group.

These dinosaurs are typically known for speed and agility. Paleontologists think ornithomimids relied on their long limbs and lightweight frames to navigate their environments without much trouble.

Experts suggest that the extended arm bones on Mexidracon longimanus hint at specialized behaviors. Some researchers believe long arms could have helped with feeding strategies or movement through dense vegetation.

This species marks only the second ornithomimosaur found in the Cerro del Pueblo Formation in Coahuila.

The fact that another close relative, a deinocheirid, also called this formation home points to a larger variety of so-called theropod lineages in the area.

What are ornithomimosaurs?

“Ornithomimosaurs are a clade of ostrich-like theropod dinosaurs characterized by relatively small and delicate skulls with large orbits, long necks, elongated forelimbs with non-raptorial manus and long cursorial hindlimbs,” explained Dr. Serrano-Brañas.

Body size can range from small forms (over 12 pounds) to the large Late Cretaceous Asian species Deinocheirus mirificus (6 tons).”

Scientists first recognized ornithomimosaurs more than a century ago. Their name derives from Greek words meaning “bird-mimic,” referencing their superficial resemblance to modern flightless birds.

The coahuila connection

The Cerro del Pueblo Formation has yielded several notable dinosaur finds, including this new one. It belongs to the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous, when shallow seas and lush vegetation spread across large parts of North America.

Paleontologists traced many local fossils to ancient floodplains and deltas. These environments likely provided abundant food, attracting a variety of dinosaurs, including smaller theropods and massive hadrosaurs.

Why Mexidracon longimanus matters

Mexidracon longimanus highlights the diversity of ornithomimids in southern Laramidia. This area was once a separate landmass during the Late Cretaceous, isolated by an inland sea that covered much of the central region of North America.

For years, most ornithomimid research focused on Canadian and U.S. sites. The discovery of these bones in 2014 helps fill in gaps about how these bird-like dinosaurs spread across what is now Mexico.

Additional bones from Mexidracon longimanus are stored at the Benemérita Escuela Normal de Coahuila museum. Researchers hope they will reveal more clues about the dinosaur’s growth, diet, and possible social behaviors.

Its extreme limb proportions could hint at broader differences within the family. Experts are keen to compare these remains with other fossils to see whether similar arm features existed elsewhere.

Slim build, big intrigue

Ornithomimids probably had toothless beaks. Many were either herbivorous or omnivorous, though some might have eaten small prey in specific conditions.

Even though this dinosaur appeared “ostrich-like,” it had a unique skeletal framework that sets it apart. Paleontologists are thrilled by the promise of analyzing something truly distinct in an already fascinating group.

Clues hidden in the bones

Bone structure plays a key role in determining how dinosaurs moved. In the case of Mexidracon longimanus, the team noted that its metacarpals – the palm bones – were longer than its foot bones, which is rare among similar species.

This unusual proportion may have affected its balance, stride, or how it interacted with the environment.

Combined with a slightly longer femur than tibia, it hints at movement patterns that might have been slower or more deliberate than expected for a lightweight theropod.

Step toward deeper understanding

Ancient creatures like Mexidracon longimanus can reshape ideas about evolutionary experiments in dinosaur body plans.

Each new discovery from Mexico adds to the picture of what Late Cretaceous ecosystems looked like on a sprawling land bridge.

This long-armed figure could inspire a renewed search for more fossils across Coahuila. That region might contain additional specimens waiting to be recognized, shedding light on how different species lived together.

What’s next for Mexidracon longimanus?

Researchers have been excited to confirm that this dinosaur belongs to Ornithomimidae. Detailed studies into its skeleton will likely continue for years, supported by advanced scanning and reconstruction technology.

There is interest in investigating if these extended arms were tied to feeding or courtship displays. Finding answers demands more fieldwork and collaboration among institutions worldwide.

The study is published in Cretaceous Research.

What was initially identified as a new asteroid has now been confirmed as something entirely different—a misidentified object that has sparked an intriguing story about space exploration.

A Space Oddity Misidentified

On January 2, 2024, the International Astronomical Union’s Minor Planet Center (MPC) announced the addition of a new object, dubbed 2018 CN41, to their list of near-Earth asteroids. The object was identified by an amateur astronomer in Turkey, who had analyzed publicly available data.

However, just 17 hours later, the MPC issued a retraction after it became clear that the supposed asteroid was actually the remains of the Tesla Roadster launched by SpaceX in 2018. The object, which had been circling the sun for nearly six years, was initially misidentified as an asteroid.

The Tesla’s Journey Through Space

The car and its mannequin driver, Starman, were the unconventional payload of SpaceX’s inaugural Falcon Heavy launch in February 2018. Rather than being destined for Mars, as initially planned, the vehicle overshot its target and instead entered a stable orbit around the sun.

Since then, it has completed around 4.5 orbits around the sun, traveling at speeds of up to 45,000 mph (72,000 km/h). Despite being launched as a publicity stunt, the car and Starman have been floating through space for years, a symbol of Musk’s bold vision for space exploration. As of now, the car has exceeded its initial 36,000-mile warranty a staggering 100,000 times.

However, the Tesla is likely no longer the shiny red car it once was. The harsh conditions of space have likely taken their toll, with intense radiation from the sun and impacts from space debris stripping away much of the car’s outer layers. Starman, the mannequin who took the driver’s seat, has likely been shredded by tiny space particles.

Growing Concern Over Space Misidentifications

This is not the first time that human-made objects have been mistaken for asteroids. Over the years, a number of spacecraft and debris have been misidentified, leading to confusion within the astronomical community. The MPC has previously listed spacecraft like the ESA’s Rosetta probe and NASA’s Lucy mission as space rocks. This growing trend has raised concerns about potential costly errors, as more human-made objects are launched into space.

Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard and Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, warns that such misidentifications could result in significant mistakes in future space exploration. He explains that, in the worst-case scenario,”you spend a billion [dollars] launching a space probe to study an asteroid and only realize it’s not an asteroid when you get there.” As the number of objects sent into space increases, astronomers worry that these errors could become more common, leading to potential disruptions in asteroid research.

The Need for Better Tracking and Transparency

While space agencies track objects in Earth’s orbit, the same level of scrutiny is not required for objects that escape our planet’s gravity, such as the Tesla Roadster. There is no current legislation mandating that companies and space agencies provide transparency about their objects once they are in deep space.

The issue of space situational awareness has become a point of concern for many astronomers. The American Astronomical Society recently emphasized the importance of better tracking of human-made space objects to avoid interference with missions, prevent confusion with natural objects, and ensure that space exploration is safe and well-coordinated."|"An amateur astronomer’s discovery of a new near-Earth asteroid has turned into a surprising revelation.

Usually, this wily, shape-shifting amoeba causes nothing worse than diarrhea. But sometimes it triggers severe, even fatal disease by chewing ulcers in the colon, liquefying parts of the liver and invading the brain and lungs.

“It can kill anything you throw at it, any kind of human cell,” said Katherine Ralston, an associate professor in the Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics. E. histolytica can even evade the immune system – and it can kill the white blood cells that are supposed to fight it.

Scientists have struggled to understand how it does this. But in a new paper published in the May issue of Trends in Parasitology, Ralston and her lab lay out a plan for finally tackling it, using genetic tools to tease apart the function of its proteins and genes.

“All parasites are understudied, but E. histolytica is especially enigmatic,” said Ralston. Building the tools for studying it has taken years. But along the way she has uncovered surprises that may set the stage for improved treatments.

Finding the murder weapon of a microscopic killer

E. histolytica enters the colon after a person ingests contaminated food or water, generally in developing countries with poor water sanitation. In the United States, it is most commonly seen in people who recently took trips overseas, or who immigrated from other countries.

Its species name, histolytica, means “tissue-dissolving” — because it creates festering pockets of liquefied tissue, called abscesses, in the organs it infects. As it rampages through a person’s organs, it doesn’t neatly eat the cells that it kills; instead, it leaves the wounded cells to spill out their contents while it hurries on to kill other cells.

Ralston started studying this fearsome little beast in 2011, during a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Virginia. Back then, people believed that it killed cells by injecting them with a poison. But as she watched it through a microscope, she saw something very different.

E. histolytica was actually taking bites out of human cells. Peering through the microscope, “You could see little parts of the human cell being broken off,” she said. Those ingested cell fragments, shining fluorescent green under her microscope, accumulated inside the amoeba.

Her report that the parasite kills cells through this process, called “trogocytosis,” was published in the journal Nature in 2014. “This was important,” she said. “To devise new therapies or vaccines, you really need to know how E. histolytica damages tissue.”

Ralston discovered, in 2022, that after the amoeba ingests parts of human cells, it becomes resistant to a major component of the human immune system — a class of molecules called “complement proteins” that finds and kills invading cells.

In a new paper, posted to bioRxiv in October 2024, Ralston and graduate students Maura Ruyechan and Wesley Huang found that the amoeba gains this resistance by ingesting proteins from the outer membranes of human cells and placing them on its own outer surface. Two of these human proteins, called CD46 and CD55, prevent complement proteins from latching onto the amoeba’s surface.

In essence, the amoebae are killing human cells and then donning their protein uniforms as a disguise, allowing them to evade the human immune system.

Building tools for scientific discovery

With other pathogens, like HIV and salmonella, scientists made rapid progress by identifying many genes, then running high-throughput experiments to knock those genes out individually to find ones that are crucial for causing disease. But that has been difficult with E. histolytica.

Its genome, sequenced in 2005, is five times larger than that of salmonella and 2,500 times larger than that of HIV. Analyzing it required years of advances in bioinformatics. But a 2013 study finally showed something promising: E. histolytica uses a cellular process called “RNA inhibition” (RNAi) as a volume knob, to control the expression of its genes.

“We thought we could turn this into a tool for understanding its genome,” Ralston said. In 2021 she, Ruyechan, Huang and six UC Davis colleagues published a paper demonstrating one such tool that they developed. Their “RNAi library” allows them to inhibit the expression, individually, of each one of the parasite’s 8,734 known genes.

In their newest paper, published as the cover story this month in Trends in Parasitology, Ralston, Huang and Ruyechan present a plan for using this RNAi system to quickly identify genes that are required for the amoeba to do crucial things, like biting human cells or stealing their proteins.

They advocate for combining this with the gene-editing tool CRISPR. Using this approach, they could label proteins with fluorescent markers, to watch them interact under a microscope; or delete small parts of genes and proteins, to find the specific parts that are crucial and could be targeted with drugs.

“We now see a light at the end of the tunnel, and we think this could be achievable,” said Huang, who is advocating for the research community to develop CRISPR for use in the amoeba.

From basic research to medical breakthroughs

The story of E. histolytica illustrates the value of basic research — and how it contributes to medical breakthroughs many years down the road.

It took years for researchers to learn how to grow this parasite in the lab and years more for Ralston to discover how it bites human cells and coopts their proteins to escape the immune system. Even after its genome was sequenced, Ralston and other scientists needed time to develop experimental tools for picking it apart. This lays the foundation for identifying genes or proteins that can be targeted with vaccines or new drugs.

“Science is a process of building,” Ralston said. “You have to build one tool upon another, until you’re finally ready to discover new treatments.”

Ralston’s work has been funded by the National Institutes of Health and received support from the American Society for Microbiology, Pew Charitable Trusts, the Hellman Foundation, and the Hartwell Foundation. This research has utilized several UC Davis research core facilities, including the Light Microscopy Imaging Facility, the Bioinformatics Core Facility, and the Center for Molecular and Genomic Imaging.

Additional authors of the 2021 paper presenting the RNAi library include: Akhila Bettadapur, Rene Suleiman, Hannah Miller and Tammie Tam (UC Davis College of Biological Sciences); Samuel Hunter and Matthew Settles (UC Davis Genome Center); and Charles Barbieri (SeqMatic LLC, Fremont, CA)."|"E. histolytica can even evade the immune system – and it can kill the white blood cells that are supposed to fight it.

Study Reveals Your Visual Speed Limit|2025-05-12 18:20:35+00:00|"When a camera whips around from one point to another, most people expect the fast movement to result in a blurry smear. What they don’t realize, however, is that our own eyes engage in a similar kind of rapid movement—called saccades—over 100,000 times a day. Unlike video cameras, our brain avoids the nauseating blur—but when things move in a particular way, they become invisible.

As detailed in a study published May 8 in Nature Communications, researchers have revealed that the speed of an individual’s saccades corresponds to the limit at which a moving object becomes too fast for them to see. That means people with faster eye movements can perceive faster-moving objects, with potential implications for activities requiring fast eye movements such as sports, video games, and even photography. The researchers claim to be the first to provide evidence for the theory that a person’s movement impacts their perception.

“What parts of the physical world we can sense depends fundamentally on how good our sensors are,” Martin Rolfs, lead author of the study and an active vision scientist at Humboldt University of Berlin’s Department of Psychology, said in a statement by the research group Science of Intelligence. “In this paper, however, we show that the limits of seeing are not just defined by these biophysical constraints but also by the actions and movements that impose changes on the sensory system.”

Rolfs and his colleagues demonstrated that when a study participant saw visual stimuli moving with the same speed and pattern as their own saccade shifts, the stimuli became invisible. This suggests the brain filters out motion that mimics our own eye movements, which might be why our saccades don’t cause visual blurs in the way that cameras do. More broadly, this suggests that physical movement—such as eye movement—limits our sensory system’s perception of the world. In other words, our ability to see things in motion is not just dictated by our sensory abilities, such as the strength, or sensitivity, of the photoreceptors in our eyes.

“In simple terms, the properties of a sensory system such as the human visual system are best understood in the context of the kinematics of actions that drive its input (in this case, rapid eye movements),” said Rolfs. Kinematics is the study of object motion without considering the cause of said motion. “Our visual system and motor system are finely tuned to each other, but this has long been ignored,” he continued. “One of the issues is that the people who study motor control are not the same ones who study perception. They attend different conferences, they publish in different journals—but they should be talking!”

It’s only a matter of time until helicopter parents start timing their kids’ saccades to decide whether they belong in little league or theater."|"When a camera whips around from one point to another, most people expect the fast movement to result in a blurry smear.

Cross-feeding networks and the microbial community model. Diagram showing the overall structure of the microbial community model. Credit: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (2025). DOI: 10.1073/pnas.2425603122

Microbial ecosystems—for example, in seawater, the soil or in the human gut—are astonishingly diverse, but researchers often struggle to reproduce this diversity in the lab: Many microorganisms die when attempts are made to cultivate them.

A new study by researchers at the Helmholtz Institute for Functional Marine Biodiversity at the University of Oldenburg (HIFMB), Germany, offers fresh insights into this longstanding puzzle, suggesting that the survival of microbes does not depend solely on the needs of individual microbes but on a hidden web of relationships that can be caused to collapse by even small structural changes.

In work published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, biodiversity experts Dr. Thomas Clegg and Prof. Dr. Thilo Gross take a simplified view of microbial communities as a network based on cross-feeding, the exchange of metabolic by-products between populations. Each species needs nutrients and at the same time releases substances that are needed as food by others.

Clegg and Gross modeled this complex network by taking a novel approach. They used tools from network theory—a mathematical method developed by physicists—to understand the behavior of complex systems.

The result of the analysis: in the model, the loss of individual populations can cause the entire network to collapse, with the microbial community transitioning abruptly to a state of lower diversity. ""These collapses act as tipping points, resembling blackouts in power grids or supply chain breakdowns seen during the COVID-19 pandemic,"" explains lead author Clegg.

Trying to grow a microbial community in the laboratory is an example of such a perturbation according to the researchers. For example, if not all members of a natural microbial community are included in a sample, they will be missing as producers of metabolic products that are vital for other species. ""By focusing on the structure of these interactions, the study offers new insight into why diversity is so hard to maintain in a lab setting,"" explains Gross.

Although researchers have long suspected that the dependencies between microbes play a key role in our ability to grow them, this study is the first to show how this works across whole communities. The findings offer a new perspective on microbial resilience, highlighting how even in resource-rich environments like lab cultures, communities can fail if the networks of relationships are disrupted.

Crucially, the model also reveals that once a community collapses, recovery can be difficult, even when resources are reintroduced. ""It's not just about what individual microbes need, but who they depend on,"" says Clegg. ""The whole community thrives, or collapses, together.""

This finding shows a new path toward designer fibers with tunable strength, elasticity, and surface chemistry.

The experiments were carried out by the Biomaterials research group at the University of Bayreuth. Using the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing system, the team inserted a fluorescent marker gene into the spiders’ silk-protein DNA, then confirmed the edit when the offspring produced crimson red threads.

Why spider silk excites engineers

Dragline silk already outperforms many man-made fibers. It resists tearing, stretches without snapping, weighs very little and breaks down harmlessly in nature.

If its molecular recipe can be tweaked at will, future filaments could combine even greater toughness with added functions ranging from antimicrobial activity to electrical conductivity. Over the past decade CRISPR-Cas9 has become biology’s precision scalpel.

The enzyme-guide complex targets chosen DNA sites, cuts them, and lets the cell’s own repair crew delete unwanted sequences or patch in new ones. The method has been applied to plants, insects, mice and more, yet spiders had remained untouched.

“Considering the wide range of possible applications, it is surprising that there have been no studies to date using CRISPR-Cas9 in spiders,” said senior author Thomas Scheibel, a professor of biochemistry at Bayreuth.

From egg injection to glowing fiber

Scheibel and doctoral researcher Edgardo Santiago-Rivera mixed the gene-editing components with a sequence coding for a red fluorescent protein. They injected this cocktail into unfertilized spider eggs and later mated the females.

Because the edit happened before fertilization, every cell in the brood carried the new blueprint. When the juveniles spun safety lines, the filaments glowed scarlet under blue light, confirming a successful gene knock-in.

“We have demonstrated, for the first time worldwide, that CRISPR-Cas9 can be used to incorporate a desired sequence into spider silk proteins, thereby enabling the functionalization of these silk fibers,” Scheibel said.

“The ability to apply CRISPR gene-editing to spider silk is very promising for materials science research. For example, it could be used to further increase the already high tensile strength of spider silk.”

Lessons learned from red spider silk

The fluorescent marker acts as a beacon, showing where and how the modified proteins fold into the fiber. That view should help unravel the still-mysterious link between amino-acid sequence, spinning process, and macroscopic performance.

With the roadmap clearer, scientists can test added modules that stiffen the thread, alter its stickiness or carry therapeutic payloads.

Artificial vs. natural spider silk

Earlier attempts to engineer silk relied on copying genes of spiders into bacteria, yeast, plants or even goats. While those hosts churn out raw protein, the artificial threads seldom match the natural product because spinning in air differs from extrusion through a spider’s duct.

Editing the spider itself preserves the native assembly line, letting researchers fine-tune properties without losing the fiber’s intricate nanostructure.

Balancing innovation and ecology

The gene-edited arachnids remained confined to secure laboratories, and the team stresses that large-scale production will require strict containment.

Spiders play key roles in ecosystems, so any field release of modified lines would demand careful risk assessment. For now. the focus lies on fundamental insight and small-batch, high-value uses such as surgical sutures or micro-mechanical springs.

The next web strands to come

Having proved that complex proteins can be knitted into dragline silk, the Bayreuth group plans to insert sequences that enhance strength, adjust elasticity, or add sensing abilities.

Marker colors beyond red could enable multicolored performance mapping. Researchers also hope to explore the spider’s six other silk types – each specialized for tasks like web capture or egg protection – to see how far CRISPR can stretch nature’s design space.

Turning point for sustainable fibers

By merging a molecular editing toolkit with the planet’s premier fiber spinner, the study opens a fresh chapter in biomaterials science. It hints at a future where customized, biodegradable threads are spun at ambient temperature by miniature eight-legged factories – no smokestacks or petrochemicals required.

For now, a vivid red glow in a strand of spiders silk stands as proof that the possibilities are real, and only beginning to be woven.

The study is published in the journal Angewandte Chemie.

The European Space Agency 's (ESA) Proba-3 mission, consisting of two spacecraft called the Occulter and the Coronagraph, flew in perfect formation at a distance of 150 meters (492 feet) from each other with millimeter precision, the agency announced in a May 8 statement .

The pair autonomously maintained their relative position for several hours thanks to a series of sensors, including the Fine Lateral and Longitudinal Sensor (FLLS) laser instrument, a shadow position sensor, and camera-based systems, in combination with onboard software and small cold gas thrusters.

(Image credit: ESA — P. Carril, 2013)

""We are talking about millimetric accuracy in range, and sub-millimetric in the lateral position,"" Damien Galano, Proba-3 project manager, said in the ESA statement.

The successful test paves the way for the spacecraft to carry out their science objective: using the Occulter to block the sun to create a total solar eclipse and allow the Coronagraph to study the sun in this unique state only occasionally seen from Earth .

Scientists aim to use these artificial eclipses to unravel a number of mysteries, such as why the sun's corona , or outer atmosphere, is so hot, what accelerates the solar wind , and how the sun flings material out into space during coronal mass ejections .

But the breakthrough in demonstrating such exquisite levels of formation flying may well have bigger implications for future science and space applications beyond studying the sun. The precision formation technology could be used for enhancing Earth observation, docking spacecraft, using an occulter and observatory to search for exoplanets , and space-based gravitational wave detection.

The two Proba-3 spacecraft were launched by an Indian PSLV rocket in December into a highly elliptical orbit, which takes them as close as 373 miles (600 kilometers) to Earth and as distant as 37,612 miles (60,530 km). The pair form up as they move toward their farthest point from Earth, when the effects of Earth's gravitational pull is smaller, meaning formation flying can be maintained with very little propellant.

Next, the challenge will be getting the spacecraft's payloads ready and then aligning the pair with the sun to create total solar eclipses .

265|https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/12/modeling_fix_for_fusion_particle_escape/|Long-standing fusion problem solved with new math: claim|2025-05-12 00:00:00|"There are plenty of reasons why fusion energy has yet to become reality, but according to a group of researchers from the University of Texas at Austin and their collaborators, we may be one modeling breakthrough closer.

The team's paper introduces a new method to address a long-standing problem in fusion physics: high-energy particles, especially alpha particles produced by fusion reactions, don't always stay confined within the magnetic fields designed to hold them. In stellarators, the type of fusion reactor examined in the study, poor confinement of these fast particles can lead to significant energy loss, making sustained fusion much harder to achieve.

Stellarators use external magnetic coils to generate complex magnetic fields that confine plasma inside the reactor. But those fields can struggle to contain fast-moving particles, especially fusion-born alpha particles, whose trajectories don't always conform to the assumptions built into standard field models.

Accurately predicting how these particles move often requires full-orbit simulations based on the Lorentz force - essentially tracking each particle's exact path. That level of modeling is extremely precise, but also computationally expensive.

UT Austin noted that it could take thousands of designs with slight adjustments to eliminate all the holes in a stellarator magnetic field, making precision design of fusion reactor magnetic fields all but impossible.

Instead of simulating every particle's full orbit, scientists traditionally rely on perturbation theory, a method that approximates particle motion by building on simpler, ideal cases. While effective in many situations, it breaks down for fast-moving particles in complex magnetic fields, leading to inaccurate confinement predictions and underperforming reactor designs.

""Direct application of Newton's laws is too expensive. Perturbation methods commit gross errors,"" said lead paper author Josh Burby, who is an Assistant Professor in the UT Austin physics department. ""Ours is the first theory that circumvents these pitfalls.""

While deeply technical, the work boils down to improving on standard approximations with a machine-learned model that better tracks fast-moving particles in the complex magnetic fields of stellarators, by leveraging a hidden symmetry that traditional methods struggle to capture outside ideal conditions.

According to a UT Austin spokesperson, the new method is ten times faster than Newtonian analysis without losing any of the accuracy, but still has shortcomings. The paper stated that the new data-driven method ""falls short"" in certain applications because it has to be repeated whenever the magnetic field changes, ""encurring [sic] unacceptable computational overhead.""

As with all things lately, we may have to rely on AI to be the saving grace that could make the method practical.

""Recent advances in machine learning, especially in foundation models and sparse regression, stand poised to tackle this challenge,"" the researchers said in the conclusion of their paper.

Additionally, the ""non-perturbative guiding center theory,"" as it's called in the paper, is developed with stellarators in mind, but the approach could, in principle, be extended to tokamaks - the more widely used fusion reactor design.

Unfortunately, the larger problem with fusion energy remains that, in practice, it still takes more energy to run the whole system than the reaction gives back. One approach, firing high-powered lasers at a tiny fuel pellet, has shown real promise.

In the one case where researchers saw so-called ""ignition,"" meaning the energy released by the fusion reaction exceeded the energy delivered to the fuel itself. But even then, far more energy was needed to power the lasers and supporting systems than the fusion produced, resulting in a net energy loss when looking at the full input-output balance.

We definitely need more energy to power our increasingly electric-hungry society, including the massive datacenters that train AI systems. But as with every advance of this type, it's just one drop in a gargantuan bucket of other things that have yet to be resolved. ®"|"The team's paper introduces a new method to address a long-standing problem in fusion physics: high-energy particles, especially alpha particles produced by fusion reactions, don't always stay confined within the magnetic fields designed to hold them.

Scientists have been baffled after discovering bizarre structures on the Martian surface which look like 'a patchwork of honeycombs, or maybe a patch of waffles'.

These 'wild' hexagonal shapes were uncovered by the Mars Curiosity Rover inside the Gale Crater, where the roaming robot landed in 2012.

Scientists say these tasty-sounding structures might hold the secrets of how life could have started on the Red Planet.

Writing in a NASA blog post, Dr Catherine O'Connell-Cooper, a planetary geologist at the University of New Brunswick, wrote: 'Coming into planning this morning, we found a workspace with amazingly well preserved polygonal shaped fractures.

'We have spotted these before but usually not as well preserved and extensive as this.'

Previous studies suggest that these types of formations may have been created by wet and dry seasons 3.6 to 3.8 million years ago.

As the planet dried out, repeated wet-dry cycles created cracks just like the ones you might see around a drying lake bed on Earth, which have been preserved ever since.

NASA's Curiosity Rover has discovered a set of baffling 'honey and waffle' structures on the Martian surface, and scientists still aren't sure how they were formed

After discovering the honeycomb fractures last week, NASA scientists instructed Curiosity to analyse their composition.

Using a technique called 'Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy', Curiosity will fire a laser pulse at the surface of the sample to create a small burst of plasma.

By looking at the light emitted by this plasma, scientists are able to work out what kinds of chemicals are in the rocks.

NASA also plans to take some measurements of the nearby bedrock without any honeycomb structures for comparison.

However, it might be some time before the findings from those studies are analysed and made public.

In the meantime, NASA's rover operators are not entirely sure what the polygon structures might be.

Dr O'Connell-Cooper says: 'The origin of these cracks is not clear - could they have formed as desiccation cracks as Mars began to get drier, billions of years ago?

'Or during later periods when groundwater moved through the bedrock?'

The structures may have been formed when an ancient lakebed repeatedly filled and dried out in Mars' wetter past. Curiosity will use its laser to gather data about the structures' composition to learn more

NASA's Curiosity Rover has been travelling around Mars' Gale Crater since it landed in 2012. This vast impact crater was formed around 3.7 billion years ago when a meteor hit the planet. In the distant past, it may have been filled with water and formed a large lake

This is not the first time that NASA has spotted regular, polygon structures on Mars, but scientists are still working to learn more about how they formed.

Previously, scientists thought that they were mud cracks, like those you might see in an empty riverbed during a drought, formed as a once-wet Mars dried out.

However, new analysis has suggested that their origins might be more complex.

In 2021, NASA first took images of a series of polygonal cracks on the slopes of Mount Sharp, a 3-mile (5 km) tall peak in the Gale Crater.

The cracks were found above a rich clay deposit, which was probably once the bed of an ancient lake, and below an area rich in sulphates left behind as the water dried.

This initially supported the idea that the cracks had been formed by a drying lake, but subsequent analysis showed that the newer cracks contained traces of sulphates.

This suggested that the lake had dried out multiple times, pulling sulphate-rich water down into the cracks.

According to the researchers, this means the cracks were made during a time in which the water level in the lake was rising and falling seasonally.

Researchers found that these cracks contained chemicals called sulphates, which suggested the lake had been repeatedly filled and dried. On Earth, these wet-dry cycles could have been the origin of the complex molecules which led to the first lifeforms

Their complex, waffle-like shape emerged and became more complex through these repeated wet-dry cycles.

Since these newly discovered polygons have a similar shape, they may have been formed through a similar process.

If so, they could hold clues to how life might have formed on Mars during the planet's wet past.

On Earth, scientists believe that repeated wet-dry cycles could be how the first organic compounds, molecules found in all living things, were formed.

As the water rises and falls, new chemicals are constantly brought into the environment, which encourages the reactions which form complex molecules.

In a statement at the time, NASA scientist Dr Ashwin Vasavada said that these processes could have 'promoted the origin of life'.

However, these smaller structures are not the only mysterious patterns that scientists have spotted on Mars.

In 2023, the Chinese Zhurong rover detected 15 vast honeycomb structures hidden dozens of metres beneath the Martian surface.

Billions of years ago, Mars may have been covered with liquid water, the traces of this history can now only be found in its geology

Scientists have also found vast polygon-shaped cracks beneath the Martian surface, which may have been formed by sudden changes in temperature as the climate shifted

Each crack is 70 metres across and is bordered by 30 metres of ice and mud slurry formed between two and 3.5 billion years ago.

On Earth, similar structures are only found in Greenland, Iceland, and Antarctica, where sudden temperature shifts create fractures that are filled with ice and mud.

Scientists believe a similar process might have split open Mars' surface as it wobbled on its axis, drastically changing the seasonal temperatures.

This could be yet another clue about how the Red Planet's climate has changed over the last few billion years, and whether it was ever habitable."|"Scientists have been baffled after discovering bizarre structures on the Martian surface which look like 'a patchwork of honeycombs, or maybe a patch of waffles'.

For decades ocean scientists assumed these round depressions – a whopping six‑football‑field stretch from rim to rim and about 16 feet deep – were scars left by bubbles of methane burping up through the mud.

That tidy explanation raised eyebrows once plans for an offshore wind farm landed on the same patch of continental slope between 1,600 and 5,200 feet below the waves. If methane were still leaking, could turbine anchors stay put?

Curiosity turned urgent when more than 5,200 of the formations, known as pockmarks, appeared to be distributed with “eerie regularity.”

The pattern suggested an active force was sculpting and preserving the craters even today.

To settle the debate, a research team rolled out a fleet of high‑tech robots and a mountain of sensors – and overturned a favorite myth about how the seafloor breathes.

Seafloor full of large pockmarks

Autonomous underwater vehicles zipped barely yards above the bottom, beaming back sonar so sharp it mapped individual ripples of sand.

The survey refined ship‑based maps and revealed that most pockmarks sit almost perfectly spaced apart, each nearly circular and averaging 656 feet across.

Back at mission control aboard the research vessel, experts from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI), the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and Stanford University watched the topography scroll across their monitors at one‑foot resolution.

The robots also carried a CHIRP sub‑bottom profiler, a sound cannon that peeks some 25 feet beneath the mud.

Instead of pockets of gas, profiles showed neat layers: thin bands of fine silt interrupted by coarser sand sheets. Those buried sand sheets hinted at something far more dramatic than gentle gas seepage.

Sending in the robots

Guided by the maps, MBARI’s remotely operated vehicle Doc Ricketts descended for 30 dives, clocking 185 hours of video and punching 107 vibracores and 433 shallow pushcores into the pockmark floors.

An additional cruise brought up piston cores nearly 25 feet long for comparison outside the craters. Not a whiff – chemical or acoustic – of methane turned up in any sample.

“There are many unanswered questions about the seafloor and its processes,” said MBARI Senior Research Technician Eve Lundsten.

“This research provides important data about the seafloor for resource managers and others considering potential offshore sites for underwater infrastructure to guide their decision‑making.”

Seafloor avalanches and pockmarks

Each core carried a timeline of turmoil. Fine mud settled quietly for millennia, then a blanket of gritty sand crashed in, marking a colossal underwater avalanche called a sediment gravity flow.

The team counted turbidite layers back at least 280,000 years, with the most recent flow sweeping through roughly 14,000 years ago.

When such a slurry roars downslope, it scours the center of every pockmark in its path and drops a fresh sand layer across the field in one go – resetting the craters like simultaneous footprints.

“We collected a massive amount of data, allowing us to make a surprising link between pockmarks and sediment gravity flows,” Lundsten explained.

“We were unable to determine exactly how these pockmarks were initially formed, but with MBARI’s advanced underwater technology, we’ve gained new insight into how and why these features have persisted on the seafloor for hundreds of thousands of years.”

Clean energy from seafloor pockmarks

Undersea avalanches strike tens of thousands of years apart, yet their legacy shapes today’s renewable energy blueprint.

Turbine foundations must grip rock‑steady ground for decades; a bubbling gas pocket could undermine that. The new findings relieve a major worry.

Instead of methane, the main architect here is long‑dormant sediment flow, meaning the crust has remained effectively quiet since well before humans started farming California’s Central Valley.

“Expanding renewable energy is critical to achieving the dramatic cuts in carbon dioxide emissions needed to prevent further irreversible climate change,” noted MBARI President and CEO Chris Scholin.

“However, there are still many unanswered questions about the possible environmental impacts of offshore wind energy development,”

Many questions still need answers

Although the study pinned down how the craters stay fresh, their birth story remains elusive.

Did an ancient mega‑flow carve the first depressions, or did subtle currents gradually nudge sediment aside until a small hollow invited bigger scours?

Computer models will test whether an unconfined flow racing over the dimpled plain can muster enough force to keep those bowls tidy without help from escaping gas.

Future research will also track how water and sediment swirl through the neighboring Lucia Chica and San Simeon Channels – twin conduits that may funnel slurries into the field.

For now, the Sur Pockmark Field stands as the best‑charted seafloor province on North America’s west coast, a natural laboratory where wind‑farm planners, geologists, and marine ecologists share common ground.

What they’ll find next is anyone’s guess.

268|https://scitechdaily.com/researchers-solve-impossible-math-problem-after-200-years/|Researchers Solve “Impossible” Math Problem After 200 Years|2025-05-12 13:52:49-07:00|"A mathematician has developed an algebraic solution to an equation that was long thought to be unsolvable.

A groundbreaking discovery from a UNSW Sydney mathematician may finally offer a solution to one of algebra’s toughest problems: how to solve high-degree polynomial equations.

Polynomials are equations where a variable (like x) is raised to various powers. A simple example is: 1 + 4x – 3x² = 0.

These equations aren’t just for math textbooks, they’re essential in everything from predicting planetary motion to coding software.

But when it comes to “higher-order” polynomials, where x is raised to the fifth power or beyond, mathematicians have struggled for centuries to find a universal solving method. That could be about to change, thanks to this exciting new breakthrough.

Now, UNSW Honorary Professor Norman Wildberger has revealed a new approach using novel number sequences, outlined in a recent publication with computer scientist Dr. Dean Rubine.

“Our solution reopens a previously closed book in mathematics history,” Prof. Wildberger says.

The polynomial problem

Solutions to degree-two polynomials have been around since 1800 BC, thanks to the Babylonians’ ‘method of completing the square’, which evolved into the quadratic formula familiar to many high school math students. This approach, using roots of numbers called ‘radicals’, was later extended to solve three- and four-degree polynomials in the 16th century.

Then, in 1832, French mathematician Évariste Galois showed how the mathematical symmetry behind the methods used to resolve lower-order polynomials became impossible for degree five and higher polynomials. Therefore, he figured, no general formula could solve them.

Approximate solutions for higher-degree polynomials have since been developed and are widely used in applications but, Prof. Wildberger says, these don’t belong to pure algebra.

Radical rejection behind new method

The issue, he says, lies in the classical formula’s use of third or fourth roots, which are radicals.

The radicals generally represent irrational numbers, which are decimals that extend to infinity without repeating and can’t be written as simple fractions. For instance, the answer to the cubed root of seven, 3√7 = 1.9129118… extends forever.

Prof. Wildberger says this means that the real answer can never be completely calculated because “you would need an infinite amount of work and a hard drive larger than the universe.”

So, when we assume 3√7 ‘exists’ in a formula, we’re assuming that this infinite, never-ending decimal is somehow a complete object.

This is why, Prof. Wildberger says, he “doesn’t believe in irrational numbers.”

Irrational numbers, he says, rely on an imprecise concept of infinity and lead to logical problems in mathematics.

Prof. Wildberger’s rejection of radicals inspired his best-known contributions to mathematics, rational trigonometry, and universal hyperbolic geometry. Both approaches rely on mathematical functions like squaring, adding, or multiplying, rather than irrational numbers, radicals, or functions like sine and cosine.

His new method to solve polynomials also avoids radicals and irrational numbers, relying instead on special extensions of polynomials called ‘power series’, which can have an infinite number of terms with the powers of x.

By truncating the power series, Prof. Wildberger says, they were able to extract approximate numerical answers to check that the method worked.

“One of the equations we tested was a famous cubic equation used by Wallis in the 17th century to demonstrate Newton’s method. Our solution worked beautifully,” he said.

New geometry for a general solution

However, Prof. Wildberger says the proof for the method is, ultimately, based on mathematical logic.

His method uses novel sequences of numbers that represent complex geometric relationships. These sequences belong to combinatorics, a branch of mathematics that deals with number patterns in sets of elements.

The most famous combinatorics sequence, called the Catalan numbers, describes the number of ways you can dissect a polygon, which is any shape with three or more sides, into triangles.

The numbers have important practical applications, including in computer algorithms, data structure designs, and game theory. They even appear in biology, where they’re used to help count the possible folding patterns of RNA molecules. And they can be calculated using a simple two-degree polynomial.

“The Catalan numbers are understood to be intimately connected with the quadratic equation. Our innovation lies in the idea that if we want to solve higher equations, we should look for higher analogues of the Catalan numbers.”

Prof. Wildberger’s work extends these Catalan numbers from a one-dimensional to multi-dimensional array based on the number of ways a polygon can be divided using non-intersecting lines.

“We’ve found these extensions, and shown how, logically, they lead to a general solution to polynomial equations.

“This is a dramatic revision of a basic chapter in algebra.”

Even quintics – a degree five polynomial – now have solutions, he says.

Aside from theoretical interest, he says, the method holds practical promise for creating computer programs that can solve equations using the algebraic series rather than radicals.

“This is a core computation for much of applied mathematics, so this is an opportunity for improving algorithms across a wide range of areas.”

Geode’s unexplored facets

Prof Wildberger says the novel array of numbers, which he and Dr. Rubine called the “Geode”, also holds vast potential for further research.

“We introduce this fundamentally new array of numbers, the Geode, which extends the classical Catalan numbers and seem to underlie them.

“We expect that the study of this new Geode array will raise many new questions and keep combinatorialists busy for years.

“Really, there are so many other possibilities. This is only the start.”

A reconstruction of a cool-temperate rainforest and river landscape during the early Cretaceous period in what is now southern Australian.

Australia is rather isolated today, but around 120 million years ago, the island straddled the polar circle and formed a giant landmass with Antarctica. At that time, dinosaurs lived on this landmass — and thanks to a new study, we now know what their habitat looked like.

New illustrations show that ""polar dinosaurs"" roamed cool-temperate forests crisscrossed by rivers and carpeted with large ferns. These dinosaurs included small ornithopods — herbivorous dinosaurs with beaks and cheeks full of teeth — and small theropods, which were mostly carnivorous dinosaurs that walked on two legs and often had feathers, one of the study's authors wrote in The Conversation .

""What is now Victoria was once within the polar circle, up to 80 degrees south of the equator and shrouded in darkness for months at a time,"" wrote co-author Vera Korasidis , a lecturer in environmental geoscience at the University of Melbourne and a research associate at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History. ""Despite these harsh conditions, dinosaurs thrived here , leaving behind evidence of their existence at various palaeontological sites.""

The amount of sunlight reaching the Antarctic Circle has remained the same over the eons, but the climate was much balmier during the Cretaceous period (145 million to 66 million years ago) than it is today, with temperatures averaging between 11 and 25 degrees Fahrenheit (6 to 14 degrees Celsius) warmer than current temperatures. The Early Cretaceous (140 million to 110 million years ago), in particular, stands out as one of the warmest periods in the past 500 million years of Earth's history, Korasidis wrote, ruling out the existence of polar ice caps.

Paleontologists have been studying rocks containing dinosaur fossils from the southern Australian state of Victoria for decades, but they have also been analyzing microscopic spores and pollen grains that may be from plant life that existed near the South Pole during the Early Cretaceous, Korasidis wrote.

For the new study, Korasidis and her co-author Barbara Wagstaff , a pollen and spore specialist at the University of Melbourne, examined nearly 300 pollen and spore samples from 48 sites along the Victoria coast. These samples, which date to between 130 million and 110 million years ago, shed light on the evolution of forests and floodplains where dinosaurs lived, Korasidis wrote.

The researchers published their findings and the first-ever reconstructions of Early Cretaceous polar landscapes Wednesday (May 7) in the journal Alcheringa .

Ancient conifers made up most of the forest canopy, while ferns — specifically, scaly tree ferns (Cyatheaceae), forked ferns (Gleicheniaceae) and another group of primitive ferns (Schizaeaceae) — dominated the understory, according to the study. The researchers noticed an abundance of flowering plants appeared starting around 113 million years ago, which agrees with the timing of the proliferation of flowering plants globally.

""The appearance of flowering plants in the landscape resulted in the extinction of numerous understorey plants,"" Korasidis wrote in The Conversation.

A new review reveals how each hemisphere processes the opposite side of your field of vision, not only early on but even in higher-level cognition like attention and memory.

This separation gives us a “bilateral advantage,” increasing our capacity to track multiple objects across the visual field. The brain seamlessly coordinates the handoff of information between hemispheres, avoiding confusion as objects move across our gaze.

Key Facts:

Bilateral Advantage: Dividing visual input across both hemispheres improves object-tracking capacity.

People have a lot of misconceptions about what the brain’s left and right hemispheres do, but one well-known aspect of this division may be even more true than people realize:

The brain not only splits up visual spatial perception—processing what’s on our left in the right hemisphere and what’s on our right in the left hemisphere—it takes cognitive advantage of that.

Credit: Neuroscience News

A new review by MIT neuroscientists explains what the field has learned about this division of labor, the trade-off it involves and how the brain ultimately bridges the divide.

“People hear all these myths about the left brain being more analytical and the right brain being more artistic, or people being right-brained vs left-brained. Ninety-nine percent of that is nonsense,” said paper co-author Earl K. Miller, Picower Professor in The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory and the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT.

“You think with your whole brain.”

But when it comes to visual spatial perception, the brain has evolved separate neural resources for the right vs left sides of gaze even in later stages of cognitive processing, Miller said. Why? To optimize its capacity.

“It’s for good reason,” said Miller, who co-authored the new review in the journal Neuropsychologia with Picower Institute research scientist Scott Brincat.

“Perceptual capacity is limited—you can only take in so much at once. If you’re your capacity is fully tied up on the right side of your gaze, you might miss a threat approaching on the left. Splitting resources between both sides helps avoid dangerous perceptual blind spots”.

Separated sight

When Miller was in graduate school, he said, he was taught that the brain neatly divided its visual perception of space between hemispheres until the information reached the prefrontal cortex where it became seamlessly blended.

But experiments by Miller and Brincat, as well as many other researchers, have been accumulating evidence to refine that view over the last 20 years.

These studies have shown that even in the prefrontal cortex, neural encoding of information about where an object is, is still biased toward the “contralateral” hemisphere, or the hemisphere opposite of where the object appears in the field of view.

“As a result, the two hemispheres appear to function surprisingly independently, even for high-level cognitive functions like attention and working memory,” the authors wrote.

The evidence is apparent in measurements of the brain waves produced by coordinated networks of neurons in each hemisphere. Gamma frequency wave power increases in frontal brain hemispheres when they consider the visual stimuli that appear on the contralateral side.

Meanwhile, studies for decades (including one in 1971) have shown that people and animals can remember more things if their presentation is split between hemispheres rather than presented all on one side.

Neuroscientists call this the “bilateral advantage,” though it is not perfect. People don’t track multiple things, even if split across both sides, as well as they track just one thing on either side.

People also exhibit individualized differences in perceptual capacity across the visual field. Miller has founded the startup company SplitSage to measure these differences with the goal of helping people with visually oriented complex tasks to improve their performance.

Notably, the studies that Brincat and Miller review in the new paper show that the split bias between hemispheres applies only to spatial information—the where something is. Other features like color or shape are processed by both hemispheres.

Seamless sight

If the brain maintains a separation in its processing of spatial visual perception, even at the stage of allocating attention and juggling objects in working memory, why aren’t we confused or surprised when a bird flying from our left passes into the right side of our field of view? We also easily handle cases where our shifting gaze moves an object from one eye’s field of view to the other’s.

“We experience a seamless world,” Miller said.

It turns out that the brain accomplishes the “handoff” from one hemisphere to the other much like two cellular towers do for your phone as you drive around, according to neural activity measurements in studies such as one in 2014 and one that Brincat and Miller led in 2021.

“As a tracked target approaches the visual midline, the hemisphere about to receive the target shows a ramp-up of activity well before the crossing time, as if it is anticipating the target,” the authors wrote.

“Further, activity in the sending hemisphere remains high well after the crossing. Thus, for up to a second or more, neural signals reflecting the target are shared across both hemispheres. It is as if both hemispheres are holding the baton.”

As with the “bilateral advantage,” there is a small performance cost when this transfer happens, studies show.

Deficits in interhemispheric connectivity or synchrony are apparent in neurological and psychiatric diseases including Alzheimer’s, anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder and autism spectrum disorders, the authors note. Brincat and Miller’s review emphasizes that such disruptions could affect cognition.

“A foundational understanding of interhemispheric processing, combined with interventions translatable to human patients offers hope for developing novel network-level treatments,” they wrote.

“Cognitive independence and interactions between cerebral hemispheres” by Scott Brincat et al. Neuropsychologia

Abstract

Cognitive independence and interactions between cerebral hemispheres

The two cerebral hemispheres can often operate independently.

But interactions between them are critical for cognition and have been implicated in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders.

Neurophysiological studies have long focused on a single hemisphere.

Here, we review recent studies showing neurophysiological evidence showing both independence and interactions between the hemispheres during complex behavior."|"Summary: Despite popular myths about left- and right-brain thinking, research shows the hemispheres truly do divide up certain tasks—especially visual spatial perception.

Controlling quantum states with high precision—and entangling particles—has long been the goal of researchers pushing the boundaries of quantum technology. Although great strides have been made across various systems, applying this control to complex molecular structures presents new and thrilling opportunities.

A recent breakthrough showcases long-lived entanglement between ultracold polar molecules, marking a major step forward. This result could reshape what's possible in quantum computing, precision sensing, and the understanding of fundamental physical laws.

Unlocking Quantum Frontiers with Ultracold Molecules

Ultracold polar molecules offer distinct benefits for quantum experiments. Their internal complexity—shaped by vibrational and rotational states and permanent electric dipole moments—makes them highly responsive to control techniques, setting the stage for advanced quantum applications.

These features allow for long-range interactions and the ability to store quantum information for longer durations. Molecules can also be used to make highly accurate measurements using rotational states. But the same sensitivity that makes them valuable also makes them fragile. Environmental interference can lead to rapid decoherence, which poses a challenge for practical use.

Even with these difficulties, researchers have made remarkable progress. Individual molecules have been held in optical tweezers, and entangled pairs have been created with high accuracy. These successes are critical milestones that bring us closer to scalable molecular quantum technologies.

Entangling molecules allows them to share quantum states and influence one another instantly, no matter how far apart they are. This capability supports the creation of synthetic dimensions for quantum simulation and opens new paths for building powerful, high-dimensional quantum computers.

Breakthroughs in Molecular Entanglement

A team of researchers at Durham University has achieved a major milestone by creating a highly controlled environment for ultracold molecules. Using optical traps known as “magic-wavelength optical tweezers,” they eliminated single-particle decoherence on experimental timescales.

This innovation allowed the entanglement of molecule pairs with unprecedented fidelity, reaching over 92% and even higher when accounting for correctable errors.

Professor Simon Cornish, a lead researcher, explained, “The results highlight the remarkable control we have over individual molecules. Quantum entanglement is very fragile, yet we can entangle two molecules using incredibly weak interactions and then prevent loss of the entanglement for a time approaching one second.”

This level of control not only preserves entanglement but also extends its duration, critical for advanced quantum applications.

The use of magic-wavelength optical tweezers stabilizes the molecules by eliminating environmental noise. This stability allows researchers to entangle molecules using detectable hertz-scale interactions at particle spacings of just 2.8 micrometers.

Furthermore, the team demonstrated entanglement using direct microwave excitation, a technique that could enable robust entangling operations despite experimental imperfections.

Applications and Implications

This breakthrough has far-reaching implications for quantum science. Long-lived molecular entanglement enhances the potential for precision measurements in quantum sensing, a field essential for detecting minute changes in physical systems. These measurements could revolutionize fields like navigation, materials science, and fundamental physics by offering unmatched accuracy.

In quantum computing, molecular systems can encode and process information in rotational states, providing a platform for high-dimensional computation.

Dr. Daniel Ruttley of Durham University emphasized the potential, stating, “Our work demonstrates the incredible potential of molecules as building blocks for next-generation quantum technologies. Long-lived molecular entanglement could be exploited to construct quantum computers or precise quantum sensors and to understand the quantum nature of complex materials.”

Moreover, this research contributes to the development of quantum memories, devices capable of storing quantum information for extended durations. Quantum memories are essential for creating robust quantum networks, which underpin technologies like quantum internet and distributed quantum computing. By stabilizing molecular entanglement, researchers have taken a significant step toward realizing these technologies.

The Future of Molecular Quantum Control

The ability to precisely control and entangle molecules offers new avenues for exploring fundamental science. For instance, ultracold molecules can simulate complex quantum materials, providing insights into phenomena that are difficult to study directly. They also hold potential for quantum-enhanced metrology, enabling measurements that push the boundaries of accuracy and precision.

This research demonstrates how advancements in experimental techniques can overcome the challenges posed by molecular complexity. By creating stable environments and leveraging the unique properties of molecules, scientists are unlocking new possibilities in quantum science. The implications extend beyond quantum computing and sensing, influencing areas like ultracold chemistry and fundamental physics.

Science textbooks may be in for another revision. Our solar system shrank from nine planets to eight after the International Astronomical Union demoted Pluto in 2006 . But there may yet be another world lurking beyond Neptune — and astronomers may have just found it.

In 2016, astronomers proposed that our solar system could harbor a stealthy ninth planet based on a strange clustering of orbits they detected among distant Kuiper Belt objects. They suggested the unseen world may be gravitationally tugging on those objects with the heft of five to 10 Earth masses. So far, there’s no direct evidence that Planet Nine exists.

Is this the one?

A new study , however, identifies a possible candidate. A separate team of astronomers compared 1983 data from the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) with 2006 data from Japan’s AKARI mission in search of faint sources that moved slightly over the intervening 23 years — the kind of slow motion you’d expect from a massive, faraway planet.

“Observing in the far-infrared is advantageous because a distant planet would be extremely faint at optical wavelengths but may emit detectable thermal radiation in the infrared,” says Terry Long Phan, an astronomy graduate student at National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan, who led the study. By eliminating stationary objects and any pairs that moved too much or too little to be the theorized world, they winnowed down from 2 million objects to just 13 possible pairs. “Most of these turned out to be false positives, typically caused by high background noise or potential stationary sources that were not detected but present in the image,” Phan says. “However, we identified one promising candidate that is consistent with the expected properties of Planet Nine.”

But the mystery isn’t solved yet. Tomo Goto, a professor at National Tsing Hua University who co-authored the paper, cautions, “The two detections from IRAS and AKARI alone are insufficient to determine the orbit of our candidate.” The team hopes to better pin down the object’s motion using the Dark Energy Camera . “Only with a well-constrained orbit can we confirm whether our candidate is indeed Planet Nine,” Goto says.

Probably not

Mike Brown, an astronomer at Caltech who originally proposed Planet Nine’s existence with his colleague Konstantin Batygin, says the candidate’s motion suggests it’s on a highly inclined and mildly retrograde orbit, nearly perpendicular to the solar system’s plane. With such an orbit, the possible planet could not explain the unusual clustering of Kuiper Belt objects that led to the prediction of Planet Nine.

“Whether it is real or not, it is 100 percent NOT Planet Nine,” Brown says. “Planet Nine is a prediction based on inferred gravitational effects in the Kuiper Belt region, and this object, even if real, would not cause these effects. So if it is real it is not Planet Nine,” and in fact, “probably disproves the existence of Planet Nine.”

So what else might it be? Brown guesses it could be either “noise” (like the static that can muddle a television or radio transmission) in the data or an astrophysical transient — an event in space that can flare up and fade away.

Whether or not this new candidate turns out to be Planet Nine, the mystery may not last much longer. The Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) survey by the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory will transform our ability to detect distant, slow-moving objects in the outer solar system.

“There is a very good chance that this survey will find it, and, even if not, will firm up the evidence that it exists,” Brown says.

The search is surprisingly difficult, considering we’ve found more than 5,800 planets around other stars.

“Personally, I feel it is unacceptable that we do not even fully understand our solar system, while 100 billion planetary systems are in our Milky Way galaxy alone, and 100 billion such galaxies in the universe,” Phan says. “It is my belief that before we try to understand stars, galaxies, or the universe, we must first come to understand our own home: the solar system.”

For now, astronomers will continue searching for clues hidden in the dark outskirts of our solar system. To some, it’s not a question of if they’ll find Planet Nine but when.

“The solar system makes no sense without it,” Brown says."|"This graphic shows a possible orbit for Planet Nine.

According to this research, the Earth will undergo a slow but irreversible atmospheric transformation.

This process, set to take place over the next billion years, will result in the depletion of atmospheric oxygen, making the planet uninhabitable for complex life forms. The study outlines a transition that is already underway on geological timescales and will eventually end the oxygen-rich conditions that support humans, animals, and plants today.

Earth’s Future Atmosphere Will Resemble Its Distant Past

The team of scientists simulated the long-term evolution of Earth’s atmosphere. They concluded that the eventual fate of our planet involves a return to a state that predates the rise of complex life. The researchers pointed to a mechanism involving the Sun’s gradual brightening, which will accelerate the breakdown of carbon dioxide (CO₂) in the atmosphere.

This decrease in CO₂ will cause photosynthetic plants to die off, eliminating the primary source of atmospheric oxygen. The result is a future where oxygen becomes so scarce that aerobic life forms—including humans—will not be able to survive. According to the study, this process could begin in as little as 10,000 years, with atmospheric oxygen dropping to levels up to a million times lower than today.

The transformation will unfold rapidly in geological terms, leaving very little time for oxygen-dependent species to adapt. Once the oxygen is gone, the Earth’s protective ozone layer will vanish as well, exposing the surface to lethal ultraviolet radiation from the Sun.

A Slow Countdown Toward Extinction

The BGR report adds context by explaining that Earth’s current oxygen levels are relatively recent. Before the Great Oxidation Event around 2.4 billion years ago, Earth was dominated by a methane-rich atmosphere and iron-saturated oceans. Life consisted primarily of anaerobic organisms like cyanobacteria.

When oxygen levels surged due to photosynthesis, the environment changed dramatically, giving rise to new ecosystems. But scientists now believe this process will reverse. The atmosphere is expected to lose its oxygen and become rich in methane once again, restoring ancient conditions unsuitable for most current life forms.

Researchers estimate that once photosynthesis collapses due to the lack of CO₂, the cascade effect will be irreversible. The surface of the planet will slowly become a dry and lifeless desert, stripped of breathable air and shelter from radiation. While humans and other animals will be long gone by the time this happens, anaerobic microorganisms—the same types that thrived before the oxygenation of Earth—may survive in isolated environments.

Microbes Will Remain After Complex Life Fades

In the distant future, Earth will likely be populated only by anaerobic bacteria and archaea, which can exist without oxygen and are immune to the high levels of methane expected in the atmosphere. According to the researchers, this form of life could persist even after the extinction of all complex species. The Earth’s environment will, in essence, return to what it was billions of years ago: a planet dominated by microbial ecosystems rather than animals or plants.

Despite the loss of complex life, the planet itself will not cease to exist. Earth will continue to orbit the Sun, albeit as a hostile and barren world. Researchers describe this scenario as a natural part of Earth’s long evolutionary arc, emphasizing that “the slow countdown of life on Earth will begin,” once atmospheric oxygen begins to fall. From that point forward, there will be no possibility of reversal.

Researchers Urge Reflection on Earth’s Temporary Habitability

The study, though focused on the far future, also carries a philosophical undertone. It highlights how fragile and temporary the conditions for life truly are. While humans may not be present when this event unfolds, the knowledge that Earth’s habitability is finite adds weight to current environmental and scientific efforts. The researchers suggest this awareness should prompt deeper reflection on how humanity treats the environment today.

The findings show that Earth’s oxygen-rich atmosphere, while seemingly permanent, is just a phase in the planet’s long geological history. The transition back to an oxygen-free world is not hypothetical—it is expected. This natural shift will not involve explosions, asteroid impacts, or artificial intelligence run amok. Instead, as described by the research team, life will end in silence, “asphyxiated by a lack of oxygen.”"|"This process, set to take place over the next billion years, will result in the depletion of atmospheric oxygen, making the planet uninhabitable for complex life forms.

(CREDIT: CC BY-SA 4.0)

Beneath the tranquil surface of Grand Traverse Bay lies a secret far older than any shipwreck. Long known for calm waters and a proud seafaring past, the bay is now drawing attention for a prehistoric twist hidden beneath its waves. Over the years, divers have uncovered the skeletons of sunken trade vessels, remnants of a vibrant shipping era. But this time, the spotlight has shifted to something far more ancient.

Dr. Mark Holley, an underwater archaeology professor at Northwestern Michigan University, made the find during a routine sonar scan. What he discovered stunned researchers—a mysterious arrangement of large stones resting on the lake bed. Dubbed ""Michigan’s Stonehenge"" by those who’ve seen it, the site is stirring fresh curiosity about the region's forgotten chapters.

About 40 feet below the surface, a winding line of stones spans over a mile. Though smaller than the famous British monument, the layout shows deliberate design. The stones range from basketball-sized to as big as compact cars, forming a serpentine trail that defies natural explanation.

Among these ancient rocks, one stands out. It measures about 3.5 feet tall and 5 feet across and features a carved mastodon. This detail links the site to a time when humans and prehistoric giants shared the same land. The image—etched in stone—offers a rare bridge between ancient life and early culture in North America.

Experts believe the stones were arranged roughly 9,000 years ago, shortly after the Ice Age ended. At that time, the waters of Grand Traverse Bay had not yet risen to cover the land. This would make the site 4,000 years older than England’s Stonehenge, placing it deep within the early Holocene period.

Mapping the Depths of Grand Traverse Bay

The bay itself stretches 32 miles long and 12 miles wide. Located along the northeastern coast of the lake, it’s a magnet for divers and history lovers. Many visit to explore the shipwrecks scattered across the bottom. But few know of the ancient relic that sleeps deeper still, hidden from curious eyes.

To protect the site, Dr. Holley took swift action. He informed the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa, showing respect for their ancestral ties to the land. Today, the location of the stone trail remains confidential. Its exact coordinates are withheld to preserve its integrity and guard it against potential harm.

The submerged nature of the stones poses a significant challenge for archaeologists. Since their discovery in 2007, progress in studying the site has been slow, leading to widespread speculation about its significance. Researchers have looked to other regional stone formations for potential correlations, hoping to unravel the secrets of these underwater stones.

Similar stone structures in the vicinity provide tantalizing clues about the purpose of the Grand Traverse Bay arrangement. Dr. John O'Shea from the University of Michigan has studied a rock formation in Lake Huron, dating back 9,000 years.

Situated 120 feet below the surface along the Alpena-Amberley Ridge, this stone assemblage is believed to have been used for ancient hunting practices, possibly to channel caribou.

Beaver Island, the largest island in Lake Michigan, also holds ancient stone formations. On the island's west side, along the Reddings Trail, a circle of glacial boulders is found, some marked with inscriptions. One stone even features a carved hole, suggesting it had a functional use.

Although formal analyses like carbon dating are lacking, these stones are thought to have been significant to the Native American communities that once inhabited the island, possibly serving as calendrical markers or celestial observation points.

Unraveling the Mysteries

The purpose of the Grand Traverse Bay stone arrangement remains speculative. It could have been used by ancient caribou hunters, similar to the Lake Huron formation, or it might have served as an ancient calendar, aligning with celestial events like Stonehenge. The ambiguity highlights the need for further research and analysis, which is complicated by the underwater setting.

As technology advances, new methods of underwater exploration and analysis emerge, bringing us closer to understanding these ancient structures. Each discovery adds to our knowledge of the past, allowing us to glimpse the lives and practices of those who lived thousands of years ago.

In the coming years, the secrets of Grand Traverse Bay are likely to unfold further, providing invaluable insights into prehistoric life and the ancient peoples who once called this region home. Through meticulous research and respectful preservation, we honor their memory and enrich our understanding of the world’s ancient past.

Using the Spektr-RG (SRG) space observatory, astronomers from the Russian Academy of Sciences have investigated dozens of X-ray sources in all-sky surveys, which resulted in the detection of 11 new active galactic nuclei. The finding was reported in a research paper published in Astronomy Letters.

Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are small regions at the center of a galaxy dominated by the light emitted by dust and gas. They are more luminous than the surrounding galaxy's light and also very energetic due either to the presence of a black hole or star formation activity at the core of the galaxy. In general, AGNs are the most luminous persistent sources of electromagnetic radiation in the universe.

A group of astronomers led by Grigory Uskov is conducting an inspection of X-ray sources discovered with SRG's ART-XC telescope and also previously known X-ray sources whose nature remains unknown. So far, their studies have resulted in the identification of more than 50 AGNs and several cataclysmic variables. Now, they report their newest findings.

""In this paper we present the results of our optical identification and classification of another 11 AGNs from the ARTSS1-5 catalog,"" the researchers wrote.

All the 11 newly found AGNs turned out to be located relatively nearby, at redshifts of 0.028-0.258. The X-ray luminosities of these sources are within the range of 2 to 300 tredecillion erg/s, therefore typical for AGNs at the present epoch.

Based on the collected data, the astronomers classified the galaxies of the 11 AGNs as Seyfert galaxies—seven type 1 (Sy 1), three type 1.9 (Sy 1.9) and one type 2 (Sy 2). In general, Seyfert galaxies are the most common active galaxies. Although they look like normal galaxies in visible light, they emit considerable infrared radiation, having broad optical emission lines, the latter with narrower emission lines. Observations show that Sy 1 galaxies have broad optical emission lines, while those of Sy 2 type showcase narrower emission lines.

The researchers also calculated the masses of black holes of the seven Seyfert galaxies reported in the paper. It was found that their masses are between 4.68 and 150 million solar masses.

According to the study, the spectrum of one of the new AGNs, designated SRGA J000132.9+240237, is described by a power law with a slope smaller than 0.5, which suggests a strong absorption and a significant contribution of the radiation reflected from the galaxy's dusty torus. The authors of the paper noted that longer X-ray observations are required to determine the physical properties of this AGN.

""We are planning to take a higher-quality X-ray spectrum of this source in the pointing mode with the SRG/ART-XC telescope to study in detail its physical properties,"" the scientists wrote.

Located at the galactic center, this 230-light-year-long filament has been struck by a pulsar moving at incredible speeds. The findings, published in May 2024 in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, provide new insights into how pulsars can interact with their surroundings in extreme ways.

The Cosmic ‘Bone’ – What is the Snake Filament?

The Snake is no ordinary structure. It is a gigantic, smooth filament of magnetic fields that spans a colossal 230 light-years across the center of the Milky Way galaxy. The Snake is essentially a vast thread of energy and matter, glowing due to spiraling particles that accelerate along its magnetic lines. What makes this filament so intriguing is not only its scale but also the fact that it has been relatively smooth—except for two notable fractures, which were previously unexplained.

These fractures have been a mystery to astronomers for some time, but recent observations using Chandra X-ray Observatory and the MeerKAT radio telescope have helped uncover the culprit behind one of the cracks.

The Role of the Pulsar in the Cosmic Collision

The source of the fracture has been identified as a radio pulsar. Pulsars are the remnants of massive stars that have ended their life cycles in violent supernova explosions. These remnants are incredibly dense neutron stars, spinning rapidly and emitting beams of radiation. The pulsar in question is thought to have been ejected from its original position after its parent star’s supernova underwent a “natal kick”—a powerful force that accelerated the pulsar across the galaxy at extreme speeds.

This pulsar’s trajectory led it straight into the Snake, where it smashed through the filament with incredible force. The collision caused a disruption of the magnetic field within the Snake, distorting the radio signals that are typically emitted from it. The surrounding area of the fracture shows an enhancement in X-ray emissions, a clear sign of accelerated electrons and positrons as a result of the pulsar’s impact.

Known as G359.13, this is one of several giant structures that resemble bones found near the center of our Milky Way Galaxy. Scientists recently discovered that this galactic ""bone,"" roughly 230 light-years long, has been fractured by a speeding pulsar: https://t.co/PUsVPMKR1h pic.twitter.com/fsyt75i1AF — Chandra Observatory (@chandraxray) May 1, 2025

Understanding Pulsar Behavior and Its Impact on the Filament

Pulsars are not typically associated with such dramatic interactions with their environments, but this discovery reveals the potential for pulsars to affect cosmic structures far beyond their immediate vicinity.

The acceleration of particles in the magnetic fields of the Snake is a direct consequence of the pulsar’s high-speed collision. This highlights a broader phenomenon in space, where fast-moving celestial objects, like pulsars and high-velocity stars, can create disturbances in their surroundings.

Astronomers are still investigating whether this pulsar’s journey could possibly take it out of the Milky Way. Given its high speed and current trajectory, it is a possibility, though the pulsar’s 26,000-light-year distance from Earth means it has a long way to travel before it would exit the galaxy."|"Located at the galactic center, this 230-light-year-long filament has been struck by a pulsar moving at incredible speeds.

A few years ago, I decided to retrain as a neuroscientist. It was a leap into the unknown — no roadmap, just a desire to grow. I chose to approach this time of change with curiosity, and I started a weekly newsletter to document what I learned. Suddenly, my doubts became fuel for discovery.

What I didn’t know at the time was that this systematic curiosity was actively reshaping my brain in ways that would build resilience for navigating future changes.

Curiosity is often treated as a personality quirk — something childlike and playful, maybe even optional. But neuroscience paints a different picture. When we’re curious, the brain’s dopaminergic system — the same one that lights up when we anticipate a reward — kicks into gear. Simply put, curiosity makes us feel good about the prospect of discovering something new.

It also helps us learn more efficiently, enhancing hippocampal activity and boosting our capacity to form and retain new memories. Studies show that when people are curious about a topic, they not only remember the specific information they were interested in but also retain unrelated material better.

Perhaps most importantly, curiosity promotes neuroplasticity, the brain’s ability to rewire itself in response to new experiences. This makes it an ideal cognitive state for those inevitable moments of change when we need to break established neural patterns and form new connections.

Curiosity in times of change

Change, by nature, introduces uncertainty. And the human brain typically responds to uncertainty by activating the amygdala, triggering the same stress responses as physical danger.

What curiosity does is transform that uncertainty from a threat into an invitation.

First, curiosity increases our tolerance for prediction error: the gap between what we expect and what we actually experience. This makes us more flexible in our thinking, less reactive, and better at updating our mental models.

There’s also a balancing act happening between two major brain networks: The default mode network (associated with imagination and introspection) and the executive control network (responsible for goal-oriented behavior) often take turns.

Curiosity helps synchronize these networks, allowing us to envision possibilities while also taking action — the exact balance needed to navigate change.

Emotionally, curiosity can also act as a buffer. When we view an unexpected situation through a curious lens (“what can I learn from this?”), we are less likely to spiral into anxiety or avoidance. This cognitive reframe can dramatically alter how we experience the inherent uncertainty of change.

5 ways to navigate change with curiosity

Curiosity isn’t a fixed trait you either have or lack — it’s a cognitive skill that can be developed. Here are five ways to cultivate it, especially during times of change:

1. Ask “what if?” instead of “what now?”

Reframe fear-based responses with questions that invite exploration. Instead of “I don’t know how to handle this new role,” try “What if I approached this role as a learning opportunity?” This simple shift activates your prefrontal cortex rather than your amygdala, which will help minimize stress in times of change.

2. Take field notes

Pretend that you are an anthropologist studying your own life. Document what surprised you, what you don’t understand yet, or what made you pause during the day. Be specific: “Today I noticed X and wondered why…” This practice builds a curiosity habit and has the added bonus of creating a record of your learning journey.

3. Run tiny experiments

Want to switch careers? Interview one new person in the field every week for six weeks. Curious about writing? Start with a weekly newsletter for three months instead of a book. These tiny experiments will provide valuable data while helping you regain a sense of agency even when the path forward is uncertain.

4. Embrace not knowing

Practice saying “I don’t know yet” without immediately searching for an answer. Spend time exploring questions without rushing to conclusions. Research suggests that this enhances cognitive flexibility and creative problem-solving — critical neural functions that support adaptation during transitions.

5. Treat failure as data

When something doesn’t go as planned, resist labeling it as a failure. Instead, treat unexpected outcomes as valuable information. By viewing setbacks as an inevitable part of growth rather than an indication of personal shortcomings, you can transform potentially discouraging moments into opportunities to learn.

It’s important to note that the brain’s capacity for curiosity fluctuates. The amygdala’s activity increases under stress, making curiosity harder to access precisely when it might be most beneficial. That’s why regularly practicing even small shifts in perspective can be helpful to train ourselves to re-engage the prefrontal cortex.

We often think of change as something to endure. But change is how we grow. Curiosity activates dopaminergic pathways, strengthens hippocampal function, improves memory formation, and increases prediction error tolerance, which enhances our capacity to navigate uncertainty with greater flexibility and less reactivity.

So, the next time you face a big change and feel anxious or stuck, try asking yourself a simple question: What if I got curious instead?"|"I chose to approach this time of change with curiosity, and I started a weekly newsletter to document what I learned.

A team of physicists has uncovered a surprising new way to explore one of science's greatest challenges: uniting the two fundamental theories that explain how our universe works—Einstein's theory of gravity and quantum mechanics.

Despite decades of effort, no one has fully explained how gravity—which governs massive objects like planets and stars—fits with quantum mechanics, which describes the behavior of the tiniest particles in the universe. But now, scientists believe light may hold the key.

Warner A. Miller, Ph.D., co-author and a professor in the Department of Physics at Florida Atlantic University's Charles E. Schmidt College of Science in collaboration with scientists at the University of Seoul and Seoul National University, South Korea, found that light's polarization—the direction it vibrates as it travels—can behave in an unexpected way when passing through curved space. Normally, this polarization shifts slightly due to the warping of space by gravity, a well-known effect.

But the team discovered something deeper: by carefully choosing how the light is measured, they could trigger a strange effect called non-reciprocity. Findings from their study were published in Scientific Reports.

""Non-reciprocity means that light behaves differently when it moves forward compared to when it goes backward,"" said Miller. ""In other words, it doesn't 'undo' its twist, even if it retraces its path. This challenges the conventional belief that light always returns to its original state after traveling a closed loop, especially if its path is influenced only by gravity.""

The key to this discovery lies in the quantization axis—essentially, the angle at which a polarizer measures the light. By adjusting this axis, the researchers could greatly enhance the effect. In fact, the shift in light's polarization angle—known as the Wigner Rotation Angle (WRA)—can become up to 10 times larger than what gravity alone would cause, even in extreme environments like near a black hole.

""We've found a way to amplify the tiny effects gravity has on light's polarization by cleverly tuning the system,"" said Miller. ""This gives us a powerful new tool to probe how gravity and quantum mechanics might be connected.""

To test their predictions, the team proposes building an astronomical interferometer—a highly sensitive instrument composed of satellites working in space. These satellites would be equipped with specially oriented polarizers designed to detect the amplified polarization shifts.

They also suggest two specific designs. One combines a Hong–Ou–Mandel setup with a Mach–Zehnder interferometer, known for their precision and ability to filter out noise. The second setup uses a highly controlled light source to compare quantum predictions with classical expectations.

These experiments could verify whether this new non-reciprocal behavior truly reveals how quantum properties of light—such as spin and polarization—interact with classical gravitational fields. Importantly, this effect could arise from any kind of polarization rotation, not just those caused by gravity, opening the door to tests of new physics, including possible violations of Einstein's Equivalence Principle or clues to quantum gravity.

""This is more than just a new experiment—it's a new way to ask the deepest questions in physics,"" Miller said.

While these experiments are designed for space, the scientists also believe that some of the effects could be tested in a laboratory, using mirrors and polarizers to simulate the necessary conditions. If proven, these non-reciprocal shifts in light's polarization could become a powerful tool for exploring the universe, helping scientists probe the fabric of space, the nature of light and the still-mysterious link between gravity and quantum mechanics.

This potential “Theory of Everything” could answer some of the deepest mysteries in science—from black hole singularities to the origins of the universe—while inviting the global scientific community to contribute to the final proof.

A Long-Sought Breakthrough in Unifying Physics

After decades of searching, scientists may finally be closing in on one of the biggest mysteries in physics: how to unite gravity with the other fundamental forces of nature. For generations, physicists have struggled to reconcile two powerful yet incompatible theories—Einstein’s theory of gravity and quantum mechanics. Now, a major breakthrough from researchers in Finland could bring us one step closer to a long-sought “Theory of Everything.”

Physicists at Aalto University have developed a brand-new quantum theory of gravity that plays nicely with the Standard Model—the framework that describes all known particles and forces, except gravity. Their work could help scientists better understand cosmic puzzles like how the universe began or what really happens inside black holes. It might sound like deep theory, but advances like this often lead to real-world tech—after all, your phone’s GPS system wouldn’t work without Einstein’s theory of gravity.

New Paper Could Unlock Big Bang Mysteries

In a newly published paper in Reports on Progress in Physics, researchers Mikko Partanen and Jukka Tulkki lay out their groundbreaking theory. And the implications could be huge.

“If this turns out to lead to a complete quantum field theory of gravity, then eventually it will give answers to the very difficult problems of understanding singularities in black holes and the Big Bang,” he says.

“A theory that coherently describes all fundamental forces of nature is often called the Theory of Everything,” says Partanen, although he doesn’t like to use the term himself. “Some fundamental questions of physics still remain unanswered. For example, the present theories do not yet explain why there is more matter than antimatter in the observable universe.”

Cracking the Gravity Gauge Theory Puzzle

The key was finding a way to describe gravity in a suitable gauge theory — a kind of theory in which particles interact with each other through a field. “The most familiar gauge field is the electromagnetic field. When electrically charged particles interact with each other, they interact through the electromagnetic field, which is the pertinent gauge field,” explains Tulkki. “So when we have particles which have energy, the interactions they have just because they have energy would happen through the gravitational field.”

A challenge long facing physicists is finding a gauge theory of gravity that is compatible with the gauge theories of the other three fundamental forces — the electromagnetic force, the weak nuclear force and the strong nuclear force. The Standard Model of particle physics is a gauge theory that describes those three forces, and it has certain symmetries. “The main idea is to have a gravity gauge theory with a symmetry that is similar to the Standard Model symmetries, instead of basing the theory on the very different kind of spacetime symmetry of general relativity,” says Partanen, the study’s lead author.

Where Relativity and Quantum Theory Clash

Without such a theory, physicists cannot reconcile our two most powerful theories, quantum field theory and general relativity. Quantum theory describes the world of the very small—tiny particles interacting in probabilistic ways—while general relativity describes the chunkier world of familiar objects and their gravitational interaction. They are descriptions of our universe from different perspectives, and both theories have been confirmed to extraordinary precision—yet they are incompatible with each other. Furthermore, because gravitational interactions are weak, more precision is needed to study true quantum gravity effects beyond general relativity, which is a classical theory.

“A quantum theory of gravity is needed to understand what kind of phenomena there are in cases where there’s a gravitational field and high energies,” says Partanen. Those are the conditions around black holes and in the very early universe, just after the Big Bang—areas where existing theories in physics stop working.

Always fascinated with the very big questions of physics, he discovered a new symmetry-based approach to the theory of gravity and began to develop the idea further with Tulkki. The resulting work has great potential to unlock a whole new era of scientific understanding, in much the same way as understanding gravity paved the way to eventually creating GPS.

Open Invitation to the Scientific Community

Although the theory is promising, the duo point out that they have not yet completed its proof. The theory uses a technical procedure known as renormalization, a mathematical way of dealing with infinities that show up in the calculations. So far Partanen and Tulkki have shown that this works up to a certain point—for so-called ‘first order’ terms—but they need to make sure the infinities can be eliminated throughout the entire calculation. “If renormalization doesn’t work for higher order terms, you’ll get infinite results. So it’s vital to show that this renormalization continues to work,” explains Tulkki. “We still have to make a complete proof, but we believe it’s very likely we’ll succeed.”

Partanen concurs. There are still challenges ahead, he says, but with time and effort he expects they’ll be overcome. “I can’t say when, but I can say we’ll know much more about that in a few years.”

For now, they’ve published the theory as it stands, so that the rest of the scientific community can become familiar with it, check its results, help develop it further, and build on it.

Hope for a New Era of Discovery

“Like quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity before it, we hope our theory will open countless avenues for scientists to explore,” Partanen concludes.

Across Texas, 93 people have been hospitalized in the outbreak. Two children in Texas have died. Both children were unvaccinated and did not have underlying health conditions, according to Texas officials.

Measles is a highly contagious illness that can spread rapidly among unvaccinated people. The two-dose measles-mumps-rubella vaccine is 97% effective at preventing measles.

Due to widespread vaccine uptake, measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000. Since then, there have still been outbreaks in communities with low vaccination rates.

Warming global temperatures and an increasing number of extreme weather events have made the pollen season in North America 20 days longer than it was in 1990, according to one 2021 study.

“Pollen seasons are effectively year-round in some parts of the country,” says Melanie Carver, the chief mission officer at the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America.

In the US and UK, seasonal allergies – also known as allergic rhinitis or hay fever – are usually triggered by tree pollen in the spring, grass pollen in the summer and weed pollen in the fall. About 26% of adults in both countries have a seasonal allergy, as do about 19% of children in the US and 10-15% of children in the UK.

As pollen seasons continue to get longer and more severe, how does one best manage allergies? We asked experts.

How do you know if you have seasonal allergies?

Common symptoms of pollen allergies include itchy, watery eyes, an itchy and runny nose, sneezing, nasal congestion and/or post-nasal drip (when mucus runs from the back of your nose down the throat), headaches, sore throat, coughing, wheezing and trouble breathing, says Dr Arveen Bhasin, an allergist-immunologist at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida.

It’s possible to develop allergies at any time.

“It’s not uncommon for adults that have never experienced them before to find themselves managing seasonal allergies for the first time later in life,” says Carver.

Moving to a new environment and encountering different foliage can trigger pollen allergies. It usually takes two years to develop sensitivities to particular allergens, says Dr Payel Gupta, a spokesperson for the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, and the medical director for allergy and immunology at Tono Health.

How do you treat seasonal allergies?

A number of over-the-counter medications can help manage allergy symptoms, says Bhasin. These include decongestants, antihistamine pills, nasal sprays and eye drops.

In order for these medications to work, says Bhasin, you have to be proactive and start your regimen at least two weeks before pollen season.

Bhasin notes that antihistamines can lose efficacy over time. If a medication “is not consistently controlling symptoms”, you “may have developed tolerance” to it, she says.

Additionally, nasal sprays need to be used regularly to be of any help. Bhasin says she often sees patients discontinue using nasal sprays after three to five days because they don’t seem to be working, but it takes 10-14 days of consistent use for these sprays to reach maximum efficacy.

Experts caution that when overused, decongestants can cause a rebound effect, where nasal congestion worsens. “Do not use them for more than three days,” says Carver, and check with your doctor before using if you have high blood pressure, heart disease, thyroid disease, glaucoma or trouble urinating.

“I really don’t understand why [decongestants] are over the counter, but they are,” says Gupta. “So people have to be careful.”

Lifestyle changes can reduce your exposure to pollen.

Inflammation and irritation are caused by pollen sitting on the surface of your skin or inside your nose and eyes, explains Gupta.

People spend as much as 90% of their time indoors, so it’s important to be mindful of how much pollen you are bringing inside, says Carver. At home, keep windows closed and the air conditioning running so that clean air can circulate. Make sure to regularly change air filters as well. When pollen counts are especially high, Carver suggests wearing a mask outside. And always remove your shoes, shower and change into a fresh set of clothes when you get home, experts say.

Air purifiers are also helpful, says Gupta, but getting one that is the right size for your space is important. The strength of a purifier is based on the square footage of a room, she explains.

When should you see a doctor?

If you have tried all the above and are still struggling with allergy symptoms, see an allergist.

“There are so many ways we can help you feel more comfortable,” says Gupta.

When over-the-counter drugs are not helping, allergists may prescribe allergy immunotherapy, meaning allergy shots or sublingual treatment (medicated drops that go under the tongue). These can help with longer-term control and relief, says Carter."|"About 26% of adults in both countries have a seasonal allergy, as do about 19% of children in the US and 10-15% of children in the UK.

Those students will remain in class, at least for now, after reports that the highly contagious virus has reached Cass County.

The North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services reported Sunday, May 11, that two unvaccinated people in Cass County were infected during international travel. One person has been hospitalized, according to a news release.

The two cases included an adult and child between the ages of 5 and 19 years old, according to the state’s measles website. They are not related to nine other cases that were reported this month in Williams County, home to Williston.

North Dakota law requires a school that has been exposed to a person with measles pull children from class for 21 days who do not have the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. That includes year-end celebrations, last day parties, field trips, graduation ceremonies and extracurricular activities, according to a letter to parents and guardians from West Fargo Public Schools.

“West Fargo Public Schools is committed to keeping our stakeholders informed and prepared,” the letter said. “While there is no cause for alarm at this time, we want you to be aware of the steps we are legally required to follow should a case occur.”

The state hasn’t required any schools in Cass County to pull students.

Fargo Public Schools said it has 297 children, or 2.6% of its student body, who are not vaccinated for measles. West Fargo Public Schools reported 303 students, or 2.3%. Moorhead has 237 students who are not vaccinated, or 3%.

Health officials recommend 95% of the population have the MMR vaccination to prevent widespread infection. North Dakota is at less than 90%, while Minnesota is at 86.5%. Cass County's vaccination rate is almost 93%. Clay is at 87%.

'Trying to carry on'

North Dakota health officials have ordered Williston Public Schools to pull unvaccinated students from Missouri Elementary School, Williston Middle School and Williston High School until late May.

Williston Public Schools has 150 children, or 2.8% of its student population, that do not meet MMR requirements, Williston Schools Superintendent Jason Germundson said.

The students who have been pulled from schools are using virtual learning to stay involved, he said.

Germundson said his district doesn't plan to cancel any sporting events, proms or graduation. The Western Dakota Association, the high school athletic conference Williston competes in, is on board with letting Williston continue to send student athletes to competitions, he said.

Graduation will happen May 25, after the quarantine period for unvaccinated students is over, he said.

“We’re trying to carry on as business as usual,” he told The Forum.

The last day of school for Williston is May 23.

“If we can get through the next 10 days without any incidents, then we’ll be good,” he said.

Area schools not impacted now

Moorhead Public Schools follows the Minnesota Department of Health’s guidance, district spokeswoman Brenda Richman said. It also “proactively and continuously reviews” its students’ vaccination status and hosts vaccine events, she said.

“This provides a convenient and accessible option for families,” Richman said. “MAPS (Minnesota Area Public Schools) health services department consistently provides family outreach and education on the importance of vaccinations.""

Moorhead’s last day of school is May 30, with graduation planned for that evening, according to its school calendar.

Fargo Public Schools, West Fargo Public Schools and Moorhead Public Schools say there have been no measles exposures in their school facilities.

Fargo Public Schools spokeswoman AnnMarie Campbell said her district is working with Fargo Cass Public Health.

“If a case of measles would be reported among our student body, we would take direction from FCPH and state health officials on any impacts to our schools,” Campbell said in a statement.

Fargo’s last day is June 5, with graduation on June 6 and 8. West Fargo’s last day is May 22 and graduation is on May 25.

“All graduation ceremonies, sports and year-end events are moving forward as planned, and we do not have any concerns at this time,” West Fargo Schools spokeswoman Heather Leas said.

Keeping informed

Williston Schools has been preparing for measles for about a month before it arrived, said Lynn Douglas, nursing director for the district. Officials there used social media, local media outlets, emails and other messaging to keep parents informed about the highly contagious respiratory disease, what the school is required to do and how to prepare for it.

“We like to keep our parents, guardians and employees aware of any possible thing that could happen,” she said. “Regularly throughout the year, we do send out information.”

Measles has just arrived in Cass County, but state health officials say they have been preparing for months to prevent the spread of the virus that was once believed to be eradicated in the United States.

Similarly, Fargo Cass Public Health has been gearing up for the anticipated arrival of measles since the first U.S. cases were reported this year, FCPH Director Jenn Faul said.

“There was increasing outreach to the school systems to look at their vaccination rates and to encourage vaccinations,” she said.

The agency also reached out to child care providers, FCPH immunization coordinator Cheryl Wavrin said.

Fargo Cass Public Health will host a walk-in clinic for the MMR vaccination from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m. Thursday at its 1240 25th St. S. Fargo location, Wavrin said. People should bring insurance cards, but those who don’t have insurance can apply for the vaccines for children program, which provides federal assistance at no cost to eligible children. A similar program exists for adults, according to North Dakota Health and Human Services.

“We will not turn anyone away if you don’t have health insurance,” Wavrin said.

Patients also can make appointments with FCPH by calling 701-241-1383, Wavrin said.

The agency also has delivered the MMR vaccine to schools in Cass County so parents can inoculate their children there, Faul said.

Clay County Public Health offers state-supplied vaccinations for its residents, including those in Moorhead.

Residents in Minnesota and North Dakota can check their vaccination records with the Docket app, which can be found at hhs.nd.gov/IRR. North Dakotans also can update records at that site, while Minnesotans can find more information at health.state.mn.us/people/immunize/miic/records.html.

Editor’s note: The podcast Chasing Life With Dr. Sanjay Gupta explores the medical science behind some of life’s mysteries big and small. You can listen to episodes here.

Hot flashes and night sweats. Light, heavy or skipped periods. Mood swings and brain fog. Sleepless nights. Changes to hair and skin.

These can all be symptoms of the menopause transition, a natural process that a woman goes through as her brain and body wind down and eventually shut off the ability to reproduce.

But honest and open discussions about menopause and the years leading up to it — called perimenopause — have, until recently, been nonexistent. Women’s experience have been either ignored or superficially played out in public for laughs, often resulting in a shroud of secrecy and feelings of shame.

Treating menopause as taboo even made the process a mystery to the very people going through it.

“When I first started to notice changes in my body, I was probably … 46, 47-ish,” Emmy-award winning comedian and writer Samantha Bee told CNN Medical Correspondent Meg Tirrell recently on the podcast Chasing Life With Dr. Sanjay Gupta. “And I was starting to do my own show. ‘Full Frontal’ had just kind of started, and I was under just … immense amounts of stress, no question.

“And I really started to feel like I was not coping well,” she said. “My body was changing — I was having physical changes — and I actually, literally didn’t know what was happening.”

Bee, who rose to fame first as a correspondent on “The Daily Show With Jon Stewart” and later with her own series, “Full Frontal With Samantha Bee,” said she would stop getting her period for a couple of months here and there. Her hair also started falling out in a way that didn’t feel typical. And she developed frozen shoulder, started sweating at night and was on an emotional roller coaster with her insides “roiling.”

Because the majority of her friends are a little younger than she is, Bee said she thought she was “going crazy” because of her job.

She finally confided in her gynecologist that she wasn’t sleeping well and “turning into Lady Macbeth.”

“And she was like, ‘Oh, you’re in perimenopause.’ And I was like, ‘There’s a word?’” Bee recounted, noting that at the time the topic hadn’t really broken the surface of popular culture.

“We’re all talking about it now, and you can read about it, and people are like, ‘Yeah!’ But eight years ago: zip, like zero information,” she recalled. “Nobody in the conversation. Not cool. Very unsexy. Mention it and you are just like a witch-crone who lives in a cave, don’t come out. … I would never in a million years have thought, ‘Oh, I’m in perimenopause.’”

You can listen to the full episode here.

Bee’s most recent project, “How to Survive Menopause,” was born out of her own bewildering experience. She performed her one-woman show in New York City in October 2024, where it was recorded live and adapted for audio by Audible.

Having a word and a framework for what she was going through, Bee said, helped put her “on a path of knowledge.”

“You’re de-pubertizing,” Bee said. Her doctor had this helpful guidance: “‘Remember all the torment you felt … when you were 15 and … every zit was an operatic tragedy? She was like, ‘That’s what that is, but just in the other direction.’”

The No. 1 thing that helped Bee most, she said, “is that you have to find a community of people that you can talk to, even if it’s just one person.”

“Just saying the words out loud and normalizing it. It’s normal. It literally happens to 50% of the population,” she said. “It’s good to make a joke about. It’s good to say it out loud. That’s actually the main thing that has helped me.”

What was not helpful, she said, was turning to social media. “I don’t like to take advice from people who are trying to sell me any type of product. Ever.”

Whom did Bee trust? For advice and guidance, in addition to her own doctor, she turned to a woman who has been called “the internet’s gynecologist,” Dr. Jen Gunter. Gunter, who authored the best-selling “The Menopause Manifesto: Own Your Health With Facts and Feminism,” is known for debunking myths about this stage of life.

“She told me that some of what happens when you are in perimenopause is that your brain is creating new neural pathways because it’s kind of cleaning itself out,” Bee said. “It’s kind of scrubbing out all of the neural pathways related to getting pregnant, feeding a baby, all of those early childhood, maternal pathways in your brain. It clears a little bit of space so it can be a time of tremendous creativity.”

Gunter, who said she likes to call it the “menopause experience” or the “menopause continuum,” agreed that we don’t talk enough about perimenopause and menopause.

“If you’ve never heard about it, how would you really know what’s going on with your body?” she told Tirrell on a separate episode of the Chasing Life podcast.

You can listen to the full episode here.

“A lot of women get their symptoms dismissed,” she said. “But also, the symptoms can be really nonspecific.”

For example, she said, women can have irregular periods, heavy bleeding, hot flashes and brain fog for other reasons. “So, there’s a combination of reasons that a lot of people don’t realize that’s what it is until they’re in the middle of it.”

How menopause is discussed in the wider culture can also be impactful.

“How you talk about something actually changes your thoughts about it,” Gunter pointed out.

“It means that we have a mind-body experience,” she said. “Everybody around you is telling you that you’re an ugly old hag whose ‘time has come,’ and all you’re seeing are 70-year-old men dating 20-year-old girls. … You could see how someone would feel worse about maybe the changes happening to their body.”

Gunter said we speak in euphemisms about men. “They have ‘erectile dysfunction.’ We don’t say ‘penile failure,’” Gunter said. “If we talked about men’s bodies the way we talked about women’s bodies, woof, that would be a whole different ball game.”

So, what do women need to know about the menopause experience? Here are Gunter’s top five facts.

The ‘what’ of menopause

Menopause marks the end of an individual’s reproductive years. The ovaries cease releasing eggs. “This is when ovulation stops,” Gunter said via email. “This means estrogen levels eventually decrease, and production of progesterone stops.”

But the progress is not gradual or linear. “Hormones can be chaotic in the time leading up to menopause, which is known as the menopause transition.”

Remember the chaos of puberty? “Think of menopause like puberty in reverse,” she said.

When does menopause start?

The menopause transition typically starts at the average age of 45, according to Gunter. “The average age of menopause 51 and the normal range is 45-55.”

“This means for some women symptoms may start in their early 40s, but for others there may be no symptoms until their late forties or even early 50s,” she added via email.

In other words, everybody is different, which makes it an unpredictable ride.

The diagnosis of menopause

Gunter explained that an individual reaches the milestone of menopause when she has not had a period for one year. “Menstrual irregularity is normal in the menopause transition, and when people are reliably skipping a period then menopause is likely 1-3 years away,” she said.

No blood or urine tests exist that can indicate whether someone is close to menopause, according to Gunter. Blood work isn’t even needed for the diagnosis. “If you are over age 45 and have gone a year without a period, that makes the diagnosis,” she said.

But sometimes more testing is required. “Blood work is indicated if someone is younger than age 45 and going 3 months or more between periods. The reason for the testing is to identify the cause of the irregular bleeding, and one cause may be premature menopause (age 40- 44) or primary ovarian insufficiency (under age 40),” she said.

For people who don’t get their periods for other reasons — due to using a hormone IUD or having had a hysterectomy — Gunter said doctors go by symptoms other than bleeding, for example hot flashes.

Symptoms and medical concerns

Symptoms can vary greatly from person to person, affect many body systems, and start and resolve at different times.

“The most common symptom in the menopause transition is irregular periods, but they can also be heavy,” Gunter said.

“Everyone is different. Hot flashes and night sweats are common symptoms,” she noted. “Depression, brain fog and joint pain can happen as well. Vaginal dryness, pain with sex and an increased risk of urinary tract infections are also common concerns.”

Menopause also ushers in some physical vulnerabilities. “The risk of osteoporosis increases with menopause. Menopause also marks a time when there is a change in the risk of diabetes and heart disease, so it’s important to be checked for diabetes, have your blood pressure checked and also your cholesterol and lipids,” she said.

A variety of treatment options

The best therapies for you will depend on your symptoms and health risks, Gunter said.

“Menopause hormone therapy (also known as hormone replacement therapy) is the gold standard for hot flashes and night sweats, and for women who choose this therapy, it should be an FDA-approved product,” she said via email. “Hormone pellets and compounded hormones are not FDA-approved and not recommended as the dosing is inconsistent and can lead to unnecessary and serious health concerns.

“Many women have heard the word bioidentical, but it is a marketing term. That being said, women should know that most hormones approved by the FDA are bioidentical,” she said.

Should all women entering menopause be on it? “We do not recommend that every woman take menopause hormone therapy, rather (that) it be prescribed for specific reasons where we have data to show it works or that is biologically plausible that it could help,” Gunter explained.

There are several key lifestyle opportunities as well, Gunter said, such as not smoking and eating a balanced, healthy diet. She recommends aiming for 25 grams of fiber every day.

“It’s also important to do resistance training and do aerobic exercise, as this improves many health domains,” she said, noting, however, that there is no need to go overboard by, say, running marathons or engaging in competitive weight lifting if you don’t already enjoy these activities.

To maintain physical fitness, aging adults can follow the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity weekly and two days per week of muscle-strengthening activities of moderate intensity.

“There are no menopause-specific supplements that have been shown in rigorous studies to help with symptoms. Considering the menopause gold rush, I recommend people steer clear of those who sell supplements as their content online is almost always geared for sales, not education,” she said.

But if a person has a specific health concern, such as low iron or low vitamin D levels, Gunter said in the podcast, a supplement can be of value. Look for one that has been certified by a third party, such as US Pharmacopeia (USP) or the NSF (the National Sanitation Foundation).

The menopause transition typically starts at the average age of 45, according to Gunter.
“Menstrual irregularity is normal in the menopause transition, and when people are reliably skipping a period then menopause is likely 1-3 years away,” she said.
The reason for the testing is to identify the cause of the irregular bleeding, and one cause may be premature menopause (age 40- 44) or primary ovarian insufficiency (under age 40),” she said.
“The most common symptom in the menopause transition is irregular periods, but they can also be heavy,” Gunter said."|['expert', 'symptoms', 'bee', 'things', 'menopause', 'samantha', 'health', 'brain', 'bees', 'know', 'gunter', 'women', 'dont', 'transition', 'age', 'wants']|||Gunter

Vaccine experts are perplexed by a project the Trump administration has launched to develop a universal flu vaccine, which has long been a goal, though an elusive one, in medical research.

Dubbed Generation Gold Standard, the project is aimed at creating a flu shot that doesn't have to be updated every year to match the latest strains of the virus. The project also aims to produce a vaccine that could protect people against other respiratory viruses that could cause a pandemic, such as bird flu and coronaviruses.

""Generation Gold Standard is a paradigm shift,"" said National Institutes of Heath Director Jay Bhattacharya in a statement announcing the project. ""It extends vaccine protection beyond strain-specific limits and prepares for flu viral threats — not just today's, but tomorrow's as well — using traditional vaccine technology brought into the 21st century.""

The announcement surprised vaccine researchers, given the anti-vaccine stance of health officials like Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

""I'm glad to see that this administration is still wanting to invest in developing next-generation influenza vaccines or respiratory vaccines in general,"" says Ted Ross, director of Global Vaccine Development at the Cleveland Clinic.

An old vaccine technology back in the spotlight

But Ross and other outside vaccine experts are mystified by many aspects of Generation Gold Standard.

First of all, the project plans to use an approach that would involve injecting people with a whole flu virus that has been killed with a chemical to render it harmless but is still capable of stimulating the immune system. Most vaccine experts consider the whole killed virus approach to be antiquated.

""This a head-scratcher to me. This is puzzling,"" says Dr. Gregory Poland, a vaccine expert who leads the Atria Academy of Science and Medicine in New York.

""We're going back to technology that was used 40, 50 years ago or more. So this is a little surprising to me why you would go backwards to this technology? It's a very old technology,"" Poland says. ""This is what influenza vaccines in the 40s, 50s and 60s looked like.""

Whole dead virus vaccines tend to produce more side effects, including high fevers and seizures that especially can frighten parents, Poland, Ross and others say. Newer, more advanced technologies are showing more promise with fewer side effects, they say.

""We have live attenuated nasal spray influenza vaccines. We have recombinant influenza vaccines. We have an mRNA-based influenza vaccine,"" Poland says. ""So why would you put all your eggs in one basket?""

A pricey bet on a single approach

And then there's the price tag: $500 million, which is a huge amount, especially at a time when federal health research funding is being slashed. The money that was originally earmarked to help explore a variety of technologies for next-generation COVID-19 vaccines.

""This amount of money is astronomical. It is foolish to put that much money onto one technology,"" says Rick Bright, a former federal vaccine expert who is now a private consultant. ""What we need now is bold 21st century solutions, not a retreat into nostalgia.""

Another aspect that's raising eyebrows is the fact that the technology — called a ""beta-propiolactone (BPL)-inactivated, whole-virus platform"" — was developed by two NIH scientists — Dr. Matthew Memoli and Dr. Jeffery Taubenberger.

Memoli was recently named as the principal deputy director of the NIH after serving as Trump's acting NIH director. Taubenberger was recently named acting director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Taubenberger holds a patent on the technology. In addition, the strategy was picked without independent, public review and based on only very limited preliminary testing.

""So that's odd,"" says Dr. Jesse Goodman, a former Food and Drug Administration vaccine expert who's now at Georgetown University. ""If you're going to do this, have an open scientific competition for the best ideas. There should be transparency for the process of how to allot funding.""

The Department of Health and Human Services confirmed the cost of the project and answered a question about the two vaccine candidates being explored, but didn't answer additional questions from NPR about the project, including why officials picked this approach and how the effort was vetted.

But in announcing it, the administration said a universal flu vaccine should be ready for widescale testing next year and could be available to the public within four years, which is a very ambitious timeline.

""The BPL platform is fully government-owned and NIH-developed,"" the announcement says. ""This approach ensures radical transparency, public accountability, and freedom from commercial conflicts of interest."""|"Trump administration's universal flu vaccine project puzzles scientiststoggle caption Science Photo Library/Getty ImagesVaccine experts are perplexed by a project the Trump administration has launched to develop a universal flu vaccine, which has long been a goal, though an elusive one, in medical research.

May 12 (UPI) -- U.S. health officials are advising patients using the drug Ixchiq to hold off while authorities seek newer information on vaccine results in the global fight against chikungunya.

The pause for U.S. patients was initiated Friday by the FDA and CDC while the two federal agencies investigate ""postmarketing reports of serious adverse events, including neurologic and cardiac events, in individuals who have received the vaccine"" Ixchiq, otherwise known as live ""Chikungunya Vaccine,"" according to a safety communication by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

In November 2023, the FDA approved Ixchiq for the prevention of disease caused by the chikungunya virus in patients age 18 years and older.

On Friday, health officials said the FDA will conduct an updated benefit-risk assessment for the use of Ixchiq in individuals 60 years of age and older after over 80,000 doses of Ixchiq were distributed worldwide.

Since the start of this year, roughly 80,000 cases and 46 CHIKVD-related deaths have been reported in 14 countries or territories, says the EU-backed European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

FDA officials said as of Wednesday that 17 ""serious adverse events"" were reported globally in people over age 62 who got Ixchiq, with two reported deaths. Of the 17 reports, six were U.S.-based, but American health officials did not indicate if any of those deaths were in the United States.

However, officials pointed out that reported adverse events ""may not be causally related to vaccination.""

According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the virus is transmitted by mosquitoes and the symptoms can last anywhere from one week to several months.

Like dengue fever, chikungunya virus causes high fever, rashes, headache and joint pain. And while most patients recover with days, the joint pain can persist for months that can be managed with pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory medications.

But while it has the potential to temporarily disable a victim, it does not often result in death.

The single-dose shot approved November 2023 by the federal government was for use in adults with an increased risk of exposure to the chikungunya virus.

Mosquitoes can infect people with Zika and chikungunya viruses at the same time, research has suggested, and may cause fatal brain infection which hit 24 victims by November 2015.

The virus was observed and described in U.S. patients who traveled from the Caribbean area to Georgia and North Carolina as chikungunya hit Cuba around May 2014.

Chikungunya, an illness caused by a virus spread via mosquito bites but not by person-to-person contact, was first detected in the Americas near the end of 2013 as it swiftly spread to other Caribbean nations, Africa and Asia.

However, no cases have been reported on Europe's mainland.

Friday's federal advisory on Ixchiq arrived amid a crackdown on vaccine use and its pertinent studies lead by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a known critic of effective and long-existing vaccines.

People with multiple long-term physical health conditions are at a significantly greater risk of developing depression, a study shows.

Researchers found that some combinations of illnesses – particularly cardiometabolic ones like diabetes and heart disease – could more than double the likelihood of a future depression diagnosis.

With multimorbidity – when patients live with two or more chronic conditions – continuing to put pressure on an already stretched healthcare system, experts say the findings highlight the need for integrated care models that address both mental and physical health.

Researchers from the University of Edinburgh used data from more than 142,000 people in the UK Biobank study to examine how physical illnesses interact to influence the risk of depression – a condition that often goes underdiagnosed in people managing long-term physical diseases.

Participants were aged 37-73 years and had at least one chronic physical condition but no history of depression.

Scientists used statistical clustering techniques to group individuals by their physical illness profiles and tracked how these clusters related to later diagnoses of depression.

One group, which included people experiencing the highest rates of physical illness also showed the highest risk of developing depression. This group had no single dominant illness, but rather a complex mix of issues.

People with both heart disease and diabetes were also found to be at high risk, as were those with chronic lung conditions like asthma or COPD – chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Liver and bowel conditions also showed a noticeable link to depression in both men and women.

Women with joint and bone problems, such as arthritis, were particularly affected, but this pattern was not as prominent for men.

In the highest-risk groups, about one in 12 people developed depression over the next 10 years, compared with about one in 25 people without physical conditions.

While the biological burden of illness may play a role, researchers say social and systemic factors could also help explain why physical multimorbidity leads to worse mental health outcomes.

Lauren DeLong, lead author and PhD student at the University of Edinburgh’s School of Informatics, said: “We saw clear associations between physical health conditions and the development of depression, but this study is only the beginning.

“We hope our findings inspire other researchers to investigate and untangle the links between physical and mental health conditions.”

Bruce Guthrie, Professor of General Practice at the University of Edinburgh’s Advanced Care Research Centre, said: “Healthcare often treats physical and mental health as completely different things, but this study shows that we need to get better at anticipating and managing depression in people with physical illness.”

Professor Mike Lewis, NIHR’s Scientific Director of Innovation, said: “Harnessing the power of data to understand the impact of chronic conditions is going to transform the way we treat patients in the future.

“NIHR’s research in this area is helping to paint a full picture of what patients are dealing with, rather than just focusing on one health condition at a time.”

“Cluster and survival analysis of UK biobank data reveals associations between physical multimorbidity clusters and subsequent depression” by Lauren DeLong et al. Nature Communications Medicine

Abstract

Cluster and survival analysis of UK biobank data reveals associations between physical multimorbidity clusters and subsequent depression

Background

Multimorbidity, the co-occurrence of two or more conditions within an individual, is a growing challenge for health and care delivery as well as for research. Combinations of physical and mental health conditions are highlighted as particularly important. Here, we investigated associations between physical multimorbidity and subsequent depression.

Methods

We performed a clustering analysis upon physical morbidity data for UK Biobank participants aged 37–73. Of 502,353 participants, 142,005 had linked general practice data with at least one baseline physical condition. Following stratification by sex (77,785 women; 64,220 men), we used four clustering methods and selected the best-performing based on clustering metrics.

We used Fisher’s Exact test to determine significant over-/under-representation of conditions within each cluster. Amongst people with no prior depression, we used survival analysis to estimate associations between cluster-membership and time to subsequent depression diagnosis.

Results

Our results show that the k-modes models perform best, and the over-/under-represented conditions in the resultant clusters reflect known associations. For example, clusters containing an overrepresentation of cardiometabolic conditions are amongst the largest (15.5% of whole cohort, 19.7% of women, 24.2% of men).

Cluster associations with depression vary from hazard ratio 1.29 (95% confidence interval 0.85–1.98) to 2.67 (2.24–3.17), but almost all clusters show a higher association with depression than those without physical conditions.

Conclusions

We show that certain groups of physical multimorbidity may be associated with a higher risk of subsequent depression. However, our findings invite further investigation into other factors, such as social considerations, which may link physical multimorbidity with depression."|"Summary: A new study reveals that people with multiple chronic physical conditions face a significantly higher risk of developing depression, especially when conditions like heart disease and diabetes co-occur.

Whether it's houses, TVs or cars - compared to decades ago, things have gone supersized.

And that includes serving sizes and waistlines.

In 2024, 43 percent of Americans were considered obese, compared to just 13 percent in the 1960s.

Experts have blamed an increased intake of ultra processed foods and meals with more calories and warned obesity can lead to a range of health problems, including heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, liver disease, sleep apnea and certain cancers.

And now, California-based nutritionist Autumn Bates has revealed what she believes is driving the obesity epidemic, detailing four reasons as to why people were slimmer in decades gone by, despite exercising less or not having access to fitness monitors like Apple Watches and FitBits.

She says she decided to investigate this phenomenon after watching a YouTube short recently that asked the question why were we so skinny in the 1960s?

The nutritionist said: '[This is a] fair question because in the 60s we had an obesity rate in America of about 13 percent.

'To put that into perspective now currently as of 2025 we have an obesity rate that is closing in on 43 percent and this is all kind of wild because it's not like people were known in the 60s for their healthy food choices.

'So why in the world did we have such lower body fat percentages back in the 60s?'

While it's easy to look at the past with rose tinted glasses, scientists say it's a cold hard fact that we were much skinnier in the past than today. Above, sunbathers sit in deckchairs at Virginia Beach in the 1960s

The first driving factor behind the rise in obesity is the decline in home-cooked, fresh meals. These used to be the rule; not the exception.

They traditionally featured 'some type of really high quality protein, some fruit, some bread, some veggies and then probably milk.'

She explains this same nutritious formula applied to children's packed lunches for school, so kids were getting more of a balanced diet compared to today.

From her research looking at what people ate in the 1960s, Ms Bates says some of the popular items included roast chicken, meatloaf, beef stew, steak and potatoes.

There was little mention of fast food, which has seen a surge in serving sizes - with calorie counts reaching nearly 2,000 for a serving of popular burgers and fries.

From personal interactions with her family, she said in a YouTube video: 'My dad said that they would pretty much always have like pot roast and my mom has a very specific, not fond, memory of lima [or butter] beans.'

Ms Bates says the benefits of meals prepared at home include a lower sugar intake, extra protein and an increased amount of vegetables.

A previous study from Johns Hopkins University found people who frequently cook their meals at home tend to consume fewer carbohydrates, less sugar, and less fat compared to those who don't cook as often.

Next, Ms Bates says another reason why today's society is fatter than ever is because of the explosion of ultra processed foods.

Ultra processed foods, or UPFs, is an umbrella term used to cover anything with a long ingredients list or made with artificial additives like colorings, sweeteners and preservatives that extend shelf life.

Ready meals, ice cream and ketchup are some of the most-loved examples of products that fall under the UPF term, now synonymous with foods offering little nutritional value.

They are different to processed foods, which are tinkered to make them last longer or enhance their taste, such as cured meat, cheese and fresh bread.

Explaining why UPFs are bad, she says: 'Ultra processed is the next level of processing that really strips down the satiety and make you so much less satisfied from your food and therefore [you] need to eat even more.

'These are foods that are primarily going to have ingredients that you don't recognize and typically a long list of ingredients that you would not be able to just get your grocery store and recreate at home.'

Ms Bates says it is estimated that 70 percent of Americans' diet today is made up of UPFs and 'some studies have found that these ultra processed foods can make us eat about 800 calories more a day because they are so much less satisfying.'

California-based nutritionist Autumn Bates (pictured above) reveals that in the 1960s America had an obesity rate of around 13 percent but today that number has more than tripled, with it now ballooning at 43 percent

The third thing that contributed to a slimmer society in the 1960s, Ms Bates says is that people were 'a lot more accidentally active'

Ms Bates advises avoiding the fattening impact of these foods and swap them out for healthier alternatives - packaged snacks with added ingredients can be swapped for fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds.

The third thing that contributed to a slimmer society in the 1960s, Ms Bates says is that people were 'a lot more accidentally active'.

She continues: 'A large portion of the workforce back then had more physically demanding jobs. They also had a lot less structured activity, meaning that they didn't really work out.

'My dad will always say that he was super embarrassed when he was younger because his dad was a health nut at the time and would go for runs and his friends would make fun of him and ask what he was running from because people had more active jobs.

'They had a full day where they were more active versus a full day of sitting in front of a computer screen and then also probably commuting.'

Ms Bates notes with the rise of technology, people have become more housebound and glued to their screens, so they are getting less physical activity.

She adds: 'My mom said that if you had to stay inside, that was a punishment when she was a kid. Kids back in the 60s really didn't have anything inside that would entertain them as much, so they had to go outside and be active and play.'

For people who have computer based jobs, Ms Bates suggests getting a walking desk, so you can walk on a treadmill while you type and keep trim.

On top of this, she recommends three to four days of structured exercise per week, such as strength training.

Lastly, Ms Bates points to a lack of sleep as another problem driving America's obesity epidemic.

Today the average American adult gets around 7 hours and 10 minutes of sleep per night and successful modern day individuals like Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey and President Donald Trump have claimed that 4 hours is the optimal amount of sleep.

This compares to the 1960s, when studies show the average was closer to 8.5 hours.

Commenting on this shift in sleeping patterns, Ms Bates says: 'Less sleep is significantly tied with obesity and weight gain.

'Low sleep causes increased hunger hormones so you're going to feel a lot more hungry the next day.

'It also increases our preferences for sweet foods and it increases our preferences for larger portion sizes.'

The nutritionist blames technology for hampering peoples' ability to sleep, with more distractions at nighttime in the form of things such as laptops, TVs and phones.

She adds: 'Plus people were more active throughout the day which meant that they were more tired and actually did want to go to sleep.

'We need to set bed times again for ourselves because there are so many different temptations to stay up late whether it be like binge watching a Netflix show or just scrolling on your phone.

'We need to actually set time limits for when we're going to be going to sleep.'"|"From her research looking at what people ate in the 1960s, Ms Bates says some of the popular items included roast chicken, meatloaf, beef stew, steak and potatoes.

Nearly 19 million children in the United States have at least one parent with a substance use disorder, according to a new study published Monday in JAMA Pediatrics. And a significant number of those children have a parent whose addiction is moderate or severe as opposed to mild, the study finds.

The number amounts to 1 in 4 children with a parent who has addiction.

""I'm an addiction doc, and so I think about this issue all the time,"" says Dr. Scott Hadland, chief of adolescent medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital, who wasn't involved in the new study. ""Even still, I was surprised at how high that percentage was. It's just an enormous number of kids that are affected.""

""If one-quarter of kids in the U.S. have a parent with a substance use disorder, that tells us that every day in our clinics we are encountering many, if not dozens of families that are affected by substance use disorders,"" he adds. ""And we need to be poised and ready to help support those families.""

The new study used data from the 2023 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, a federal survey that estimated the prevalence of substance use and mental health disorders based on the most updated criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 (DSM-5). The national survey is managed by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, but the team in charge of the survey was let go as part of the recent reduction in force. It is unclear how the cuts will affect the future of the survey.

The study's main finding is significantly higher than previous estimates (7 million in a study originally published in 2022), which had relied on diagnostic criteria from the DSM-IV.

The new study also estimated how many children have a parent with a moderate or severe addiction as opposed to mild.

""We also found that 7.6 million children live in a household with a parent that has either a moderate or severe substance use disorder,"" says study author Sean Esteban McCabe, director of the Center for the Study of Drugs, Alcohol, Smoking and Health at the University of Michigan. ""And 3.4 million live with a parent with multiple substance use disorders.""

McCabe and his team also found that more than 6 million children have a parent with a mental health condition in addition to a substance use disorder.

""These estimates are incredibly important to understand the scope of parental substance use disorder in the United States,"" wrote Dr. Davida Schiff in an email. Schiff is a pediatrician and addiction medicine physician at Massachusetts General Hospital and wasn't involved in the new study.

Another notable finding in the study, according to Schiff, is that a majority of the parents — 12 million — had alcohol use disorder. ""While alcohol is more socially acceptable in our society, the study points to a need to pay greater attention to a rising number of children exposed to parental alcohol use disorder.""

""It's also important to remember that alcohol is actually the leading cause of substance-related deaths in the United States,"" notes Hadland. ""It actually kills more people in the U.S. than do opioids every year, but it's a slower death rate. It's a chronic disease process that affects, you know, somebody's liver, somebody's risk of developing cancer.""

And children of parents with addiction are themselves at a higher risk of various physical and mental health problems.

""Young children growing up in homes affected by parental SUD (substance use disorder) are at increased risk of experiencing impaired caregiving, disruption of parental abilities, unintentional ingestions, and witnessing parental overdose,"" wrote Schiff.

They are also at a higher risk of developing certain mental health conditions and substance use problems in the long run.

""One thing that I'm doing as a pediatrician is when I'm caring for a young person who has a parent with a substance use disorder, is making sure that I'm doing a good job asking about and screening for mental health concerns like depression, anxiety, ADHD, all of which we know can be more common in kids of parents with addiction,"" says Hadland.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that pediatricians ask patients and/or parents about substance use in the family in order to educate them about the risks of substance use and connect families to treatment when needed.

""We as pediatricians and family medicine doctors might think about screening parents for substance use and substance use disorders when they come into our clinics to help make sure that we can identify problems and get parents connected to treatment, because that's probably in the best interest of their child,"" says Hadland.

Parents with addiction love their children and want the best for them, she says, but may not access treatment because of stigma about seeking help for addiction and barriers to accessing care.

The US Preventive Services Task Force, which sets clinical care guidelines for the country, issued new guidance today calling on doctors to screen for syphilis throughout pregnancies.

Syphilis is a bacterial infection that women can pass to their babies in utero, known as congenital syphilis, which can interfere with the fetus' development.

Rates of the STD have been rising rapidly in recent years thanks to a combination of missed testing, treatment and prenatal care gaps, substance use, social stigma, and testing delays.

In 2023, the US reported nearly 4,000 cases of congenital syphilis, up more than a third from 2021 and 10 times higher than a decade ago.

There were also 279 congenital syphilis-related stillbirths in 2023, the highest number reported in 30 years.

A 2018 federal recommendation urged all pregnant women to be screened for the disease, but the USPSTF is emphasizing its importance by reissuing this recommendation given the upticks in cases and still births.

Women are already recommended to get screened from the disease early, at their very first visit with a gynecologist weeks of pregnancy - between eight and 12.

Women are recommended to get screened from the disease early, at their very first visit with a gynecologist weeks of pregnancy - between eight and 12. This applies to women who have been previously tested for syphilis

But the UPSTF also recommended screening at 28 weeks' gestation and a third time at delivery.

Revealing the guidance, members of the task force said: '[We] conclude with high certainty that screening for syphilis infection in pregnancy has a substantial net benefit.'

They added: 'Rates of new syphilis cases have continued to rise over the past three decades, especially in women.

'Although men account for the majority of syphilis cases, the change in incidence among women was 2 to 4 times higher than that among men between 2017 and 2021.'

Congenital syphilis can cause severe long-term problems for the baby. They may be born too early, too small, or stillborn.

Newborns with the infection can have life-threatening complications such as severe anemia, swollen liver and spleen, yellowing skin (jaundice), and bone deformities.

The infection can also cause brain and nerve damage, leading to inflammation of the covering around nerves, blindness, and permanent hearing loss.

The USPSTF said: 'A recent analysis of national data from 2022 found that 5 percent of congenital syphilis cases (197/3761 cases) occurred in late pregnancy after having had a negative syphilis screening result earlier in pregnancy.

In 2023, states and DC reported nearly 4,000 cases of congenital syphilis. This marks a 3 percent rise from 2022, following a 32 percent surge from 2021 to 2022.

'Similar to the disparities seen in the burden of syphilis, 40.6 percent of these cases occurred in Black women, 28.4 percent occurred in Hispanic or Latina women, and 19.8 percent occurred in White women.'

Some retrospective studies estimate that 25 percent to 50 percent of congenital syphilis cases could be prevented by repeat screening in the third trimester of pregnancy.

The task force added: Congenital syphilis increased more than 10-fold over a recent decade, from 334 cases in 2012 to 3882 cases in 2023.

Your browser does not support iframes.

'It is estimated that almost 90 percent of new congenital syphilis cases could have been prevented with timely testing and treatment.'

The infection can be cured in utero with consistent treatment with the antibiotic penicillin, ideally before the second trimester.

A 2014 systematic review of 54 observational studies found that the incidence of congenital syphilis, preterm birth, low birth weight, stillbirth, and newborn infant death was dramatically reduced in pregnant women treated for syphilis during pregnancy compared with those who had untreated syphilis.

Screening for congenital syphilis involves a blood test that detects antibodies that may reflect infection with Treponema pallidum, the organism that causes syphilis.

Most states mandate screening for syphilis in all pregnant women at the first prenatal visit, and some mandate repeat screening early in the third trimester and at delivery.

During pregnancy, the body goes through many changes that can sometimes cause false positives on syphilis screening tests.

These tests look for signs of tissue damage, not just syphilis itself. Pregnancy can trigger similar reactions because of hormonal shifts, immune system adjustments, or other conditions like autoimmune diseases.

A positive result on the first test doesn’t always mean syphilis—it needs a second, more specific test to confirm.

The infection is spread through contact with fecal matter. Unhoused people are more likely to experience the dangerous infection given lack of easy access to handwashing and public restrooms.

Infection is also more common in women living in areas where cases are generally high, those with a history of HIV, incarceration, or sex work.

'Clinicians should be aware of the prevalence of syphilis infection in the communities they serve and state mandates for syphilis screening,' the task force said."|"They added: 'Rates of new syphilis cases have continued to rise over the past three decades, especially in women.

The health agency said the Canadian resident spent time in western Washington between April 30 and May 3 and visited “multiple public locations in Renton, Bellevue, Seattle, Everett and Woodinville while contagious with measles, but before being diagnosed with measles.”

Health officials said the person’s vaccine status is unknown, and this case is not connected to any previous local measles cases. Measles can spread before a rash appears and people know they have the disease.

, the Canadian resident visited the 16 locations listed below. The times listed include the estimated time the person was at the location and two hours after since the measles virus can remain airborne for up to two hours after an infected person leaves the area:

on April 30 - May 3 from 9 a.m. through 10 a.m.

on April 30 from noon to 3:30 p.m.

on April 30 from 2-5 p.m.

(Gate S1)on May 3 from 8:30 a.m. – 1:30 p.m.

Most residents in western Washington are immune to the disease through vaccination. According to Public Health – Seattle and King County, anyone who visited the locations above during the listed times and is not immune to measles will “most likely” become sick between May 7 – 24.

“Globally and in the U.S., we are experiencing a significant measles resurgence. With over 1,000 cases reported so far this year nationally, 2025 is on track to have the highest number of measles cases in the U.S. since the early 1990s,” said Meagan Kay, Medical Epidemiologist for Public Health – Seattle & King County. “It’s an important time to check your vaccination status and get vaccinated if you aren’t protected.”

What is measles?

Measles is a highly contagious and potentially severe respiratory disease. The virus is airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. The virus causes fever, rash, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes.

If one person has measles, Public Health – Seattle and King County said up to nine out of 10 people nearby will also become infected if they’re not protected.

Symptoms can begin between seven to 21 days after exposure. The virus is contagious from around four days before a rash appears through four days after it appears, and the virus can be spread before the “characteristic measles rash” appears, health officials said.

There’s no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable.

Can measles be fatal?

It usually doesn’t kill people, but it can.

Common complications include ear infections and diarrhea. But about 1 in 5 unvaccinated Americans who get measles are hospitalized, the CDC said. Pregnant women who haven’t gotten the vaccine may give birth prematurely or have a low-birthweight baby.

Among children with measles, about 1 in every 20 develops pneumonia, the CDC said, and about one in every 1,000 suffers swelling of the brain called encephalitis — which can lead to convulsions, deafness or intellectual disability.

How can you prevent measles?

The best way to avoid measles is to get the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old.

There is data on the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine because it's been around for decades.

Vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the COVID-19 pandemic, and most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners — the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.

Do you need a booster if you got the MMR vaccine a while ago?

Health care professionals are sometimes tested for antibodies to measles and given boosters if necessary, even if they’ve already had the standard two doses as a child.

Health officials said people at high risk for infection who got the shots many years ago may also want to consider getting a booster if they live in an area with an outbreak. Those may include family members living with someone who has measles or those especially vulnerable to respiratory diseases because of underlying medical conditions."|"is warning the public after a Canadian resident visited over a dozen locations in King and Snohomish counties while infectious with measles.

The consistency stems from the fixed position of blood vessels under the skin, which constrict after prolonged immersion, creating the familiar loops and ridges.

Researchers tested the same fingers across multiple immersions and found near-identical wrinkle topography each time. The findings could have forensic applications, including identification of bodies exposed to water and new approaches in biometric science.

Do your wrinkles always form in the same pattern every time you’re in the water for too long?

According to new research from Binghamton University, State University of New York, the answer is yes.

A couple of years ago, Binghamton University Associate Professor Guy German published research about why human skin wrinkles when you stay in the water too long.

Received wisdom held that the water swelled your skin and made your fingers wrinkly, but little to no research had been done to prove that.

What German and his team at the Biological Soft Matter Mechanics Laboratory found is that blood vessels beneath the skin actually contract after prolonged immersion, and that’s where the wrinkles come from.

He wrote about the research for The Conversation — a nonprofit news organization that asks academics to share their expertise on current topics — as part of its Curious Kids feature. One of the follow-up questions stumped him, though.

“A student asked, ‘Yeah, but do the wrinkles always form in the same way?’ And I thought: I haven’t the foggiest clue!” said German, a faculty member at the Thomas J. Watson College of Engineering and Applied Science’s Department of Biomedical Engineering. “So it led to this research to find out.”

In a paper recently published in the Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials, German and Rachel Laytin ’23, MS ’24, show that, yes, the topography patterns remain constant after multiple immersions.

“Blood vessels don’t change their position much — they move around a bit, but in relation to other blood vessels, they’re pretty static,” German said. “That means the wrinkles should form in the same manner, and we proved that they do.”

The research put subjects’ fingers in water for 30 minutes, taking photos and then repeating the immersion under the same conditions at least 24 hours later. By comparing the images, German and Laytin found the same patterns of raised loops and ridges after both immersions.

They also made an interesting side discovery: “We’ve heard that wrinkles don’t form in people who have median nerve damage in their fingers,” German said.

“One of my students told us, ‘I’ve got median nerve damage in my fingers.’ So we tested him — no wrinkles!”

As much fun as it was to figure out something a child asked, the research also could have real-world applications in forensics, such as fingerprinting at crime scenes and identifying bodies found after prolonged water exposure. German’s father, a retired U.K. police officer, faced some of these challenges during his law enforcement career.

“Biometrics and fingerprints are built into my brain,” he said. “I always think about this sort of stuff, because it’s fascinating.”

German is eager to further explore questions about skin immersion with his students: “I feel like a kid in a candy store, because there’s so much science here that I don’t know.

“We thank the people at The Conversation and the wonderful question they asked us, because does it create cool new science.”

“On the repeatability of wrinkling topography patterns in the fingers of water immersed human skin” by Guy German et al. Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials

Abstract

On the repeatability of wrinkling topography patterns in the fingers of water immersed human skin

Finger wrinkling during and after water immersion, often called pruning, is an evolutionary mechanism that increases grip strength in water.

Previous studies have determined that water-induced finger wrinkles result from vasoconstriction, or the tightening of blood vessels below the skin’s surface.

However, no previous studies have characterized the morphology of topographical finger wrinkles.

We anticipate that vasoconstriction also governs the morphology of finger wrinkles formed.

Since these constricting blood vessels are stationary, we expect the pattern created by topographical wrinkles formed to remain constant over time.

To evaluate pattern repeatability, images of human fingertips at two separate time points are overlaid and compared visually to establish corresponding wrinkle pairs.

Wrinkle pairs are vectorized with orientation correlations evaluated quantitatively using normalized dot products, then compared against randomly oriented control vectors.

The results demonstrate a significant relationship between wrinkle orientation across both time points and thus reveal the consistency of wrinkle morphology over time."|"Summary: New research confirms that the wrinkles on your fingers after water exposure always form in the same pattern.

In contrast, those with restricted networks, often limited to family and shaped by isolation, reported significantly worse health and were less likely to improve their social ties over time.

Focused networks offered emotional closeness but lacked the health benefits of broader connection. Encouragingly, some individuals transitioned into more enriched networks, suggesting social mobility is possible with the right support.

A new study sheds light on the powerful connection between social networks and health in later life and reveals a surprising path for improving health equity among older adults.

Published in the journal Innovation in Aging, the study tracked over 1,500 older adults for a decade using three rounds of data from the National Social Life, Health and Aging Project.

Led by Lissette Piedra, a professor of social work at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; and James Iveniuk, a senior research scientist at the University of Chicago’s National Opinion Research Center; the team identified three types of social networks — enriched, focused and restricted — that reflected how socially connected people were as they aged.

People in enriched networks — those marked by diverse, active relationships — reported the highest levels of self-rated health, a measure strongly associated with overall well-being.

Those in restricted networks — smaller, more isolated groups centered on family — reported significantly poorer health. Focused networks fell in between, providing emotional support but with limited breadth.

Individuals in the restricted group reported significantly poorer health at the beginning of the study. However, by the end, both those in the restricted and the focused groups showed worse health outcomes than people in the enriched group, though the differences had narrowed, according to the study.

“Social isolation and loneliness can have corrosive effects on mental and physical health,” said Piedra, who is also a professor of Latina/Latino Studies.

“Older adults’ social circles may shrink due to poor health, loss of loved ones, poverty, discrimination, language barriers or living in rural or unsafe communities.”

Those who were Black, Hispanic or from other minoritized racial and ethnic groups reported the highest levels of loneliness. Yet one of the most hopeful findings from the study was that some individuals were able to expand their networks over time, Piedra said.

Despite having the smallest networks, people in the focused group reported lower loneliness than those in the restricted group, suggesting that frequent, meaningful interactions can buffer the effects of limited network size.

It was also a high mobile group: More than 43% of people in the focused group moved into enriched networks during the study, and 22% transitioned into the more isolated restricted group.

By contrast, over 85% of those who began in the restricted group remained there, highlighting the stability — and vulnerability — of this network type, the researchers found.

“If you start off in a restricted network, the likelihood that you’re going to move out of it is low,” Piedra said. “Many people who are vulnerable — such as women and people of color — are more likely to see their social connections decline and become restricted over time.”

The study also found that women, Black participants and the oldest respondents were more likely to transition from enriched to focused networks, reflecting the compounding effects of aging, widowhood and structural barriers. Loss of a spouse or close friend can trigger a rapid contraction of one’s social circle, especially for those in tight-knit networks, Piedra said.

“If you’re an older woman and your social life revolved around your husband, his death may cause your network to decline,” Piedra explained.

“Similarly, living in a community with high crime, a rural area with few activities, having limited transportation or disability can all make it harder to stay socially connected.”

Piedra said the key takeaway is that social networks are not fixed. With the right opportunities and supports older adults can build stronger, more enriching relationships despite these types of disadvantages.

“That was the silver lining,” Piedra said.

“We saw movement into more robust networks across all groups. That gives us reason to be hopeful. We know that these social networks are particularly important as we age and that loneliness has huge implications for cognitive and physical health. The quality of our final years becomes very problematic without an enriched social life,” Piedra said.

“It behooves us to understand who is vulnerable and think about creating tailored public health interventions so that everyone can age well.”

“Social network types and self-rated health among diverse older adults: Stability, transitions and implications for health equity” by Lissette Piedra et al. Innovation in Aging

Abstract

Social network types and self-rated health among diverse older adults: Stability, transitions and implications for health equity

Background and objectives

This study explores how social networks among older adults evolve over time and their impact on self-rated health (SRH), emphasizing differences across ethnoracial and linguistic groups. Though the link between social networks and well-being is well-known, how these networks change and affect health remains less understood.

Research Design and Methods

The study examined changes in social network types across three rounds of the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project. The initial sample included 3,005 individuals, which decreased to 1,592 by the final follow-up.

We analyzed data from participants in every round, totaling 6,858 observations, using Random-Intercept Latent Transition Analysis. Multinomial logistic regressions were conducted to predict network membership and transitions, and to assess correlations with SRH.

Results

We identified three distinct social network types: ‘Enriched,’ ‘Focused,’ and ‘Restricted.’ ‘Enriched’ networks feature broad connections, high marriage rates, active engagement, and low loneliness. ‘Focused’ networks involve small, close-knit groups with frequent interactions, moderate marriage rates, and low loneliness. ‘Restricted’ networks are family-oriented, with low marriage rates and the highest loneliness levels.

Over time, ‘Restricted’ networks became more prevalent, while ‘Focus’ networks showed the most mobility.

Network type membership varied significantly by ethnoracial identity and gender, with Black, Hispanic, and female respondents less likely to belong to ‘Enriched’ networks. Membership in ‘Enriched’ networks was linked to better SRH scores.

Discussion and Implications

The growth of ‘Restricted’ networks over time raises concerns about older adults becoming confined to limited social environments. However, there is a silver lining: within the ‘Focused’ group, more individuals transition to ‘Enriched’ networks than to ‘Restricted’ ones, indicating that older adults can expand their social connections as they age.

Understanding the factors driving this shift can guide interventions to promote network expansion for vulnerable groups, enhancing social well-being, and mitigating the risks associated with restricted networks."|"“Social network types and self-rated health among diverse older adults: Stability, transitions and implications for health equity” by Lissette Piedra et al.

In our newly published research, my colleagues and I made a step toward unraveling some of these mysteries by shedding light on the genetics of OCD.

Obsessive compulsive disorder is one of the most impairing illnesses worldwide. Affecting about 1 in 50 people globally, OCD is among the top 10 causes of years lost to disability, leading to harmful effects on a person’s ability to work and function in the world and on their family.

Compared with people without OCD, a person with the condition has a 30% higher chance of dying prematurely from natural causes, such as infections or other illnesses, and a 300% higher chance of dying early from nonnatural causes, such as accidents or suicide.

People with OCD experience obsessions – disturbing, recurrent and unwanted thoughts, fears or mental images – and compulsions, such as repetitive behaviors and rituals performed to ease the anxiety usually caused by obsessions. For example, someone might wash their hands dozens of times or in a specific way to get rid of germs, even if they know it’s excessive or illogical. Avoiding certain places or situations to reduce anxiety or prevent triggering obsessions and compulsions is also common.

While the exact causes of OCD are unclear, researchers know that both genetic and environmental factors play a role in its development. OCD can run in families; studies attribute between 40% to 65% of OCD cases to genetic factors. OCD that begins in childhood has a stronger genetic influence than OCD that begins in adulthood.

But unlike some genetic diseases caused by a single faulty gene, such as cystic fibrosis or Huntington’s disease, OCD is influenced by hundreds to thousands of genes that each play a small part in disease risk.

My colleagues and I analyzed the DNA of over 53,000 people with OCD and over 2 million people without OCD, the largest study of this kind for this condition. We discovered hundreds of genetic markers potentially linked to OCD – data we hope will ultimately lead to improved ways of identifying people who are at risk for OCD and, down the line, to better treatments.

How scientists study OCD genetics

To find the genes involved in OCD risk, researchers use a method called a genome-wide association study, or GWAS. These studies compare the DNA of tens to hundreds of thousands of people with a disease of interest with the DNA of people without the disease, looking for tiny differences in the genetic material. These genetic markers may be linked to OCD or indicate the presence of other genes linked to the disease.

In a GWAS, scientists carefully test each of the millions of genetic markers across the genome to identify those found more often in people with OCD than in people without OCD. They then determine which genes those markers are associated with, where in the body they are active and how they might contribute to the condition.

We identified 30 areas in the genome linked to OCD, containing 249 genes of interest in total. Of those, 25 genes stood out as likely contributors to the development of OCD.

The top three genes we found are also linked to other brain disorders such as depression, epilepsy and schizophrenia. Several other genes of interest for OCD were found in a region of the genome that plays a role in adaptive immunity and has been associated with other psychiatric disorders.

Importantly, no single gene can predict or cause OCD on its own. Previous genetic studies have demonstrated that genes across all of the 23 pairs of chromosomes in people may contribute to OCD risk.

Genetic insights into OCD

Because the contribution of each genetic marker or gene to disease susceptibility is very small, GWAS are not useful for identifying genes that cause OCD for a given person. Rather, this kind of research helps scientists understand how the brain works in people with OCD and whether OCD shares genetic roots with conditions that commonly occur alongside it.

For example, the genetic markers we found to be associated with OCD were highly active in several brain regions known to play a role in development of the condition. These brain areas are collectively involved in planning, decision-making, motivation, error detection, emotion regulation, and fear and anxiety, all of which can malfunction in OCD.

We also found associations with a brain region called the hypothalamus, which converts emotions such as fear, anger, anxiety or excitement into physical responses. The hypothalamus has not been directly linked to OCD before, but it is part of a network of brain regions that may contribute to its symptoms.

Additionally, we found that certain types of brain cells – particularly medium spiny neurons in a brain region called the striatum – were strongly linked to the OCD genes we identified. Medium spiny neurons play an important role in habit formation, the process by which a behavior becomes automatic and habitual – think compulsions. Specific receptors on medium spiny neurons are common targets for medications that are sometimes used to help treat OCD.

The results of our study can help researchers better understand the relationships between OCD and other conditions. We found genetic links between OCD and several other psychiatric disorders, especially anxiety, depression, anorexia and Tourette syndrome. People with OCD also showed lower genetic risk for conditions such as alcohol dependence and risk-taking behavior, aligning with what doctors see in clinics: Many people with OCD tend to be cautious and avoid risks.

Surprisingly, we also found genetic overlaps between OCD immune-related conditions. While having OCD appears to be linked to an increased risk of asthma and migraines, it may also be linked to a reduced risk of inflammatory bowel disease. These findings may lead to new insights about the role the immune system and inflammation play in brain health.

OCD is a complex disorder that can look very different from person to person. Understanding the genetic and biological factors behind OCD helps researchers move closer to better diagnosis, treatment and possibly even prevention.

As a practicing psychiatrist and researcher, I have spent my career working to understand the causes of OCD and to improve the lives of those who live with the condition. With larger studies and continued research, my team and I hope to better match specific biological patterns to individual symptoms.

In time, this could lead to more personalized and effective treatments – improving the lives of millions of people living with OCD around the world."|"While the exact causes of OCD are unclear, researchers know that both genetic and environmental factors play a role in its development.
How scientists study OCD geneticsTo find the genes involved in OCD risk, researchers use a method called a genome-wide association study, or GWAS.
These genetic markers may be linked to OCD or indicate the presence of other genes linked to the disease.
Previous genetic studies have demonstrated that genes across all of the 23 pairs of chromosomes in people may contribute to OCD risk.
Additionally, we found that certain types of brain cells – particularly medium spiny neurons in a brain region called the striatum – were strongly linked to the OCD genes we identified."|['genetic', 'genes', 'uncovered', 'brain', 'researchers', 'providing', 'risk', 'ocd', 'clues', 'hundreds', 'causes', 'linked', 'disease', 'play', 'role', 'research', 'changes']|||

That does not mean that golf courses are directly causing Parkinson's, but the authors of the study, led by Brittany Krzyzanowski of the Barrow Neurological Institute in the US, have a hypothesis. They think that rampant pesticides on fairways and greens may be exposing nearby residents to toxic chemicals via the air and water.

That's a scary prospect, to be sure, but independent experts at the non-profit Parkinson's UK, who were not involved in the current research, have called these suspicions ""reductive"".

frameborder=""0″ allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"" referrerpolicy=""strict-origin-when-cross-origin"" allowfullscreen>

Parkinson's disease is a complex neurological condition without known cause, and in recent years, intense debate has raged over whether certain pesticides may increase the risk of neurodegeneration.

Farmers, for instance, tend to face higher risks of Parkinson's, as do those who live in historically industrial regions. Studies in the lab suggest some pesticides and air pollutants can be toxic to brain cells.

But while human-made chemicals may be a factor in Parkinson's disease, so could genetics. The evidence at this point is not clear-cut.

""Many studies have investigated whether pesticides increase the risk of developing Parkinson's in different populations around the world,"" says Katherine Fletcher, lead researcher at Parkinson's UK.

""The results have been varied, but overall suggest that exposure to pesticides may increase the risk of the condition. However, the evidence is not strong enough to show that pesticide exposure directly causes Parkinson's.""

The newest research from Krzyzanowski and colleagues at the Mayo Clinic, the University of Rochester, and the University of Kansas adds to the debate.

Their population-based study compared 419 Parkinson's cases with 5,113 healthy individuals, matched for sex, age, and demographics.

After adjusting for various neighborhood characteristics, the team found that living within a mile (1.6 kilometers) of a golf course was associated with a 126 percent increased risk of developing Parkinson's, compared to those living more than 6 miles (nearly 10 kilometers) away.

What's more, people living within water service areas containing a golf course were found to have nearly double the odds of developing Parkinson's compared to those living in golf-free areas.

These correlations have led Krzyzanowski and colleagues to argue that golf courses are a possible risk factor for Parkinson's disease, and that pesticides in the air and in the groundwater may contribute to that risk.

""Public health policies to reduce the risk of groundwater contamination and airborne exposure from pesticides on golf courses may help reduce risk of Parkinson's disease in nearby neighborhoods,"" argue Krzyzanowski and her team.

But Fletcher and her colleague, David Dexter, at Parkinson's UK are unconvinced. The new study never tested for groundwater contamination near golf courses, or pollutants in the air, nor did the researchers properly control for other sources of urban air pollution, like that kicked up by road traffic.

What's more, groundwater data on pesticides around golf courses is limited, and a 2024 study found that airborne pesticides are of ""limited concern"" to golfers, even after playing an 18-hole course purposefully sprayed with chemicals.

""Parkinson's starts in the brain 10 to 15 years before diagnosis, and the study didn't only use subjects who permanently lived in the area,"" adds Dexter in an independent comment.

""This would not only affect participants' exposure, but also suggests their Parkinson's could have started before they moved around a golf course.""

The current research elevates recent concerns around pesticides, but it is hardly a hole-in-one. Researchers will need to take quite a few more swings to prove that pesticides from golf courses are leaching into groundwater and raising the risk of Parkinson's for those living nearby.

The study was published in JAMA Network Open."|"A contentious new study has found that people who live near golf courses may face a higher risk of Parkinson's disease.

The capsules produce a temporary coating in the gut that prevents food from being absorbed, forcing it into the lower intestine and triggering hormones that make you feel full.

Its manufacturers say it may have advantages over weight-loss injections such as Ozempic and Mounjaro, including having fewer side effects and being easier to take.

It is also far safer and less invasive than actual gastric bypass surgery.

Rahul Dhanda, chief executive of Syntis Bio, makers of the pill, said: ‘The problem is [fat jabs] are not very tolerable and patients want to come off them.

‘You want to have a long-term maintenance therapy, and an oral pill is the rational choice because it’s simple, tolerable and safe.

The capsules produce a temporary coating in the gut that prevents food from being absorbed, forcing it into the lower intestine and triggering hormones that make you feel full

‘What we’re seeing now is patients and clinics being more focused on having something safe and sustainable to keep on a manageable, sustainable weight-loss path.

‘I anticipate the side effects to be minimal to none, and we haven’t seen any yet in human tests. That is because it doesn’t enter the bloodstream like injections do.

‘It’s a mechanical molecule, so it’s like we’re inserting a stent, as opposed to a drug that is acting with the target, and also off the target.’

By binding to the mucous membrane lining of the duodenum - the top of the intestine near the stomach - the pills create a barrier that stops calories being absorbed.

It forces food directly into the lower part of the digestive system, the pills set off a ‘cascade’ of hormones including GLP-1, the same chemical mimicked by semaglutide jab Wegovy.

It also causes the body to stop producing ghrelin, which makes you feel hungry, and start producing leptin, which makes you feel satisfied.

Manufacturers say it may have advantages over weight-loss injections such as Ozempic and Mounjaro, including having fewer side effects and being easier to take

The person taking the pill feels full more quickly and stops eating.

The coating created by the pill sheds naturally after about 24 hours, leaving no trace.

The effect is similar to gastric bypass, in which surgeons make the stomach smaller and shorten the small intestine, changing how the body absorbs food and leaving people feeling fuller after eating less.

In rats, the drug caused the animals to lose 1 per cent of their bodyweight per week while preserving 100 per cent of their lean muscle mass.

Trials in humans have not studied weight loss but found the pills cause no harmful side effects.

If they prove effective in further trials, the pills could help patients maintain a healthy weight after intensive weight-loss with jabs, or replace the injections entirely.

Dr Louis Aronne of Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City told the conference that a 'golden age' of treatment had begun with these new drugs.

The Times reported he was pushing for health providers, including the NHS, to 'roll them out at scale', addding: 'I think use of drugs like this will prevent the need for many other medications, procedures, and surgeries.

'We are just beginning to see in how many ways they can help.'"|"A pill that mimics the effect of a gastric bypass has been touted as the latest weight loss miracle – and may even be more effective than fat jabs in the long term.

In fact, approximately 11% of the U.S. population is enjoying this classic comfort food on any given day. But if you're trying to improve your diet, you might be wondering: What are the healthiest frozen pizzas to stock up on instead?

Frozen pizzas are notoriously high in sodium, calories and saturated fat. They also tend to be lacking in the vegetable department. While an occasional pizza night isn't going to make or break your health, if pizza is a part of your weekly meal rotation it's worth being mindful of which ones you choose — after all, it's estimated that pizza makes up 27% of your total energy intake on the day that it's eaten.

Anna Smith, a registered dietitian for Lose It and owner of Anna Smith Nutrition in Nashville, notes that even if frozen pizza isn't ""exactly a health food, if it's what gets your family sitting down to share a meal, that's a win in my book. There's a ton of research linking shared meals with positive outcomes for kids and adults alike."" But what if you could enjoy a shared meal without compromising your health goals? Luckily, there are many better-for-you frozen options — the key is figuring out which ones are actually worth the money.

Best overall healthy frozen pizza

Alexandra Ginos Best overall healthy frozen pizza Banza Margherita Pizza Serving size: ½ pizza | Calories per serving: 400 | Protein per serving: 16 g | Fiber per serving: 10 g | Sodium per serving: 730 mg | Standout nutritional features: Vegetarian, certified gluten-free Banza became a household name thanks to its chickpea-based mac and cheese, but I'd argue that its frozen pizza is equally worthy of recognition. Banza Margherita Pizza is vegetarian-friendly, certified gluten-free and totally crave-worthy thanks to its crunchy crust and flavorful toppings. The ingredient list has nothing to hide, with easy-to-read ingredients, including real cheese, San Marzano tomato sauce, basil and oregano. Nutritionally, this pizza is a home run thanks to its chickpea flour-based crust. In fact, each serving — which is half of the pizza — offers 16 grams of protein and 10 grams of fiber, making it a much more filling option than your standard frozen Margherita pizza. Plus, unlike many cauliflower crust-based pies, Banza's pizza has a crisp yet slightly soft texture that more closely resembles a traditional flour crust. According to one Amazon reviewer, ""Banza Margherita Frozen Pizza is hands down the best gluten-free pizza I've ever had!"" They add, ""The crust is perfectly crisp, and the Margherita toppings are fresh and flavorful. With more protein and fiber than traditional pizza, Banza is my go-to option for a nutritious meal that doesn't compromise on taste. It's perfect for anyone looking for a healthier pizza alternative."" While the Margherita was our fave, this chickpea pizza is also available in other flavors, including vegan varieties like Vegan Roasted Veggie. The biggest downside is the price, as one pizza serves only two people. Some customers also complain about the lack of topping options, though this can easily be remedied by adding your own roasted veggies, lean proteins or sliced olives on top. Pros High in fiber

More protein than a typical veggie pizza

Certified gluten-free

Vegan-friendly option available

Crisp yet slightly chewy crust

No artificial additives Cons High in sodium and saturated fat $53.99 for 4 boxes at Banza Explore More Buying Options $8 at Target

Alexandra Ginos Best cauliflower crust frozen pizza Milton's Roasted Vegetable Cauliflower Crust Pizza Serving size: ½ pizza | Calories per serving: 340 | Protein per serving: 18 g | Fiber per serving: 3 g | Sodium per serving: 700 mg | Standout nutritional features: Certified gluten-free Milton's Roasted Vegetable Cauliflower Crust Pizza features a cauliflower crust that actually crisps and bends like a traditional pizza. It's topped with roasted zucchini, bell peppers and onions for an extra boost of veggies and has more protein than you might expect from a vegetarian pizza — 18 grams per serving — thanks to the inclusion of egg whites in the crust. Best of all, the serving size is half of the pizza, which feels truly satisfying. Milton's cauliflower crust reminds me of the delicious frozen pizzas I ate as a teenager, in the best way. This pizza has a thin, chewy and crispy bottom crust, and I wouldn't have guessed based on taste and texture that it's a cauliflower-based and gluten-free option. One Amazon reviewer agrees, saying, ""The crust is flaky and delicate and scrumptious, something I didn't think I could ever enjoy again after discovering I can't tolerate much wheat in my diet. This is a quality item! I've had the other big brand of cauliflower crust and this is MUCH better."" Just keep in mind that this pizza is still high in saturated fat and sodium and may not be the best option if you have high blood pressure or are watching your salt intake. Pros Vegetable-based crust and toppings

Certified gluten-free

18 grams of protein per serving

Delicious crispy, chewy crust

Alexandra Ginos Best high-protein frozen pizza Vital Pursuit Chicken Mozzarella Pizza Serving size: 1 pizza | Calories per serving: 370 | Protein per serving: 33 g | Fiber per serving: 17 g | Sodium per serving: 690 mg | Standout nutritional features: High in fiber, protein and calcium If you're looking for a pizza that's high in protein yet helps you stay within your calorie goals for the day, it's hard to beat Vital Pursuit Chicken Mozzarella Pizza. Despite its smaller size, each serving — which is the whole pizza — boasts 33 grams of protein and 17 grams of fiber. It's also low in carbs, with only 25 grams per pie. Considering that the pizza contains just 370 calories, it's also a good option if you're trying to lose weight. Thanks to the cheese topping, it's high in calcium, with 530 mg per portion, and a good source of vitamin A. Best of all, this pizza is quick to make, as it can be heated in the air fryer or microwave. I opted to try it in the microwave and liked it more than I thought I would. While the texture was a bit softer than an oven-baked pizza, the flavor more than made up for it thanks to the gooey cheese and savory chicken. Online reviewers are overall impressed by Vital Pursuit Chicken Mozzarella Pizza's nutrition stats, though it gets mixed reviews on taste, with some finding it too spicy, while others find the flavor to be lacking. As with others on our list, this pizza is high in saturated fat and sodium, which may be a downside for some. Pros High in protein and fiber

Can be prepared in the microwave or air fryer

Portion-controlled

Only 8 grams of net carbs

Delicious savory taste

High-protein vegetarian option also available Cons High in sodium and saturated fat

Alexandra Ginos Best plant-based 'meat' frozen pizza Blackbird Pepperoni Pizza Serving size: ⅓ pizza | Calories per serving: 290 | Protein per serving: 9 g | Fiber per serving: 2 g | Sodium per serving: 550 mg | Standout nutritional features: Vegan-friendly, non-GMO Craving pepperoni pizza but following a plant-based diet? Try Blackbird Pepperoni Pizza. This vegan-friendly pizza features Beyond Meat Beyond Pepperoni and plant-based cheese for a meat- and dairy-free slice that's still every bit as gooey and savory as its non-vegan counterparts. The thick, chewy crust is another standout, as are the slices of fresh garlic on top. Blackbird Pepperoni Pizza is made by hand in a tree-nut and peanut-free New York City-based facility and has rave reviews from vegans and non-vegans alike. According to one reviewer, ""This pizza has a fluffy, airy crust, with a crisp bottom and the sauce is tangy and delicious. It's a simple Margherita, but the flavor goes a long way. Vegan or not, this pizza is great!"" The biggest caveat is the high saturated fat content, with 50% of the recommended daily amount. While it's not a deal-breaker, if you eat this pizza regularly you'll just want to keep an eye on your saturated fat intake at other meals and snacks. Pros Vegan-friendly

9 grams of protein per serving

Delicious chewy crust

Satisfying savory flavor Cons Mouthfeel of the cheese was a little sticky

For a boost of flavor and fiber, the frozen pizza is topped with fire-roasted vegetables I liked the crunchy, crisp crust and was impressed with the melty vegan cheese. However, I definitely noticed the lower protein content, as I was still a bit hungry after polishing off a serving. One reviewer refers to this pizza as ""Gluten and dairy-free deliciousness."" They add, ""[It's] the only pizza brand I trust with my food allergies. I bake it and cut it into slices for work. Melts well, texture is crispy and soft at the same time. Pricey but good quality.""

Speaking of which, if you're looking for a gluten-free and grain-free crust that isn't made from cauliflower or chickpeas, this is the option for you. The ingredient list is simple, consisting mainly of the cheeses and a sauce of tomato puree, though the crust does contain some additional tapioca starch and eggs to hold everything together. Despite all the cheese, I didn't feel like the pizza was too heavy, and I liked the chewiness of the crust. I also appreciated the relatively lower sodium content and 12 grams of protein per serving. This gluten-free pizza has over 1,000 mostly positive reviews online, with one Amazon reviewer raving, ""This is by far the best gluten-free pizza my husband and I have tried — and we've tried quite a few. With this pizza, we can either add toppings or leave as is — the crust is a perfect blend of crispy and soft, and the flavor is really delicious."" It's important to note that this pizza comes in two sizes — the 15 ounce that I tried and a larger, family-friendly 24-ounce size. If you're looking to feed a crowd, opt for the larger size (the nutrition details included here are based on the 24-ounce pizza). Pros Certified gluten-free

Alexandra Ginos Best no-cheese frozen pizza Amy's Roasted Vegetable Pizza, No Cheese Serving size: ⅓ pizza | Calories per serving: 290 | Protein per serving: 7 g | Fiber per serving: 3 g | Sodium per serving: 540 mg | Standout nutritional features: Vegan-friendly, dairy-free, corn-free, soy-free, tree nut-free, non-GMO ingredients Sometimes called a tomato pie or pizza marinara, a cheese-free pizza can be a good option for those who prefer to avoid or limit dairy — or who simply want a lighter alternative. If you prefer your pizza without cheese, then Amy's Roasted Vegetable Pizza, No Cheese is a delicious choice. It's vegan-friendly, made from non-GMO ingredients and free from dairy, corn, soy and tree nuts. It also provides 7 grams of protein and 3 grams of fiber per serving. This healthier frozen pizza tasted nearly restaurant quality to me, with a chewy crust, juicy roasted veggies, sweet caramelized onions and a bit of balsamic vinegar. I really liked the lightness — my stomach didn't feel as heavy or full as it typically does after eating a cheese-heavy pizza. This pizza was also a favorite among the dietitians we spoke to. Vandana Sheth, a dietitian and nutrition consultant in Los Angeles, recommends it because ""it's packed with colorful veggies, lower in saturated fat without the cheese and still very flavorful,"" though she notes that it's still not a low-sodium option by any means, with 540 mg per serving. Amy Brownstein, dietitian and owner of Nutrition Digested in San Francisco, also favors this pizza and others from Amy's because of the brand's use of fresh ingredients. ""Plus, as a plant-based dietitian, I like knowing that all of [Amy's] foods are vegetarian-friendly,"" she adds. This frozen pizza has over 100 five-star reviews on Amazon. One satisfied reviewer shares, ""My household is vegan. But my daughter despises vegan cheese. So this is her alternative, and she loves it. Once the rest of the household tasted it, we all loved it as well. So we have to make sure we don't try to eat up all her slices or buy multiple pizzas for everyone. The artichokes on the pizza are the real MVP."" The catch? It's one of the pricier options given its relatively small size. Pros Vegan-friendly

Dietitian-approved tips for including pizza in a healthy diet

If you're trying to eat healthier, pizza doesn't have to be off the table. In fact, depending on the recipe or product, it can be a nutritious addition to your weekly meal rotation. The key is being mindful of portion sizes and slowing down to enjoy each bite. ""Eating slowly helps you tune in to your body and stop when you're full, not stuffed,"" recommends Smith. Diane Han, a weight management dietitian in San Francisco, agrees, noting that honoring your fullness cues allows you to enjoy pizza night without feeling sick or uncomfortable.

Also keep in mind that frozen pizza, even if it has veggies, typically isn't a balanced meal all on its own. Pairing pizza with a salad, a bowl of roasted vegetables and/or lean protein, like grilled chicken, can help round out the meal and ensure you're getting adequate amounts of important nutrients, like protein, fiber and healthy fats.

Han also recommends adding these nutrient boosters directly to your pizza, either before or after baking. ""Top your pizza with salad greens or roasted veggies so you won't even need utensils!"" she says. Brownstein offers a similar recommendation, saying you can ""zhuzh up frozen pizza by topping it with extra vegetables or leftover proteins."" For a quick and easy dinner, she recommends placing a pan of fresh or frozen vegetables in the oven at the same time as your pizza.

Factors to consider when shopping for frozen pizza

With many frozen pizzas being marketed as a healthier option, how do you know which ones deserve a spot in your shopping cart? Here are some key factors to keep in mind:

Serving size

Check the pizza box to see how much of the pizza counts as a serving. Pizzas vary in diameter and thickness, and suggested serving sizes range from one-fifth of a pizza to a whole pizza. Serving sizes can be deceptive, and if you're hungry, a pizza with a small serving size might not be satisfying enough.

Nutrition stats

The amount of calories, saturated fat, protein and fiber you should aim for per serving depends on your health goals and what you're eating the rest of the day. That said, as a general guideline, aim for pizzas with at least 3 grams of fiber and 12 grams of protein and less than 10% of the daily value for saturated fat. Sheth also suggests looking for options with around 300 to 400 calories per serving, though some people may need a higher-calorie option.

Sodium content

When it comes to frozen foods, it's hard to avoid sodium completely. Not only is sodium found in the cheese and crust of frozen pizza, but this salty nutrient also helps extend the shelf life. That said, some frozen pizzas are higher in sodium than others. Smith recommends choosing a pizza with less than 650 mg of sodium per serving. She also notes that it's not always possible to find a pizza that's high in protein and fiber yet low in sodium. Instead, she recommends simply choosing a pizza that comes closest to hitting these targets.

Toppings

Frozen pizzas are available with a wide range of toppings, from cheese- and meat-loaded pies to roasted veggies and vegan cheese alternatives. When looking for the healthiest frozen pizza, Brownstein recommends choosing a pizza that has some vegetables on it, ""whether it's mushrooms, olives, broccoli, spinach or something else. The vegetables add some extra vitamins, minerals and fiber to help create a balanced meal."" If you enjoy meat on your pizza, Sheth recommends choosing an uncured version without added nitrates/nitrites due to health concerns. Plant-based ""meats"" can also be a good alternative, though these products can be high in sodium.

Crust

Standard frozen pizzas feature crusts made with white wheat flour. While delicious, white flour crusts are typically low in fiber or other essential nutrients thanks to processing and refining. They also aren't suitable for folks with gluten allergies or sensitivities. For added fiber and protein, Han recommends opting for a crust made from chickpeas (for extra protein) or cauliflower. ""These crust options also offer more fiber and are lower in carbohydrates, making them a delicious option for those looking to manage blood sugar levels,"" she notes. Plus, cauliflower and chickpea crusts are typically gluten-free, though you'll want to double-check the label to be safe.

How we chose the healthiest frozen pizzas

To choose the healthiest frozen pizzas, I consulted four registered dietitians for their insights on which ingredients, nutrient amounts, toppings and types of frozen pizza they recommend. I also leaned on my expertise as a dietitian and experience eating frozen pizzas to select 12 healthier frozen pizzas from 11 brands to test. Each pizza was evaluated based on its nutritional profile, ingredient list, taste and texture. I also factored in taste and online reviews when deciding the top seven healthiest frozen pizzas.

Other products we tested

Not every pizza we tested made the cut, but that doesn't mean you won't enjoy them. (Alexandra Ginos)

Five pizzas ultimately didn't make it into the final rankings, but that doesn't mean they aren't worth considering. Below is a quick look at the ones that didn't make the cut. For even more options, our in-house team tested 16 other popular frozen pizza brands — check out their favorites.

Caulipower Trufflicious Mushroom : The mushroom, truffle oil and white sauce made for a decadent and delicious taste. It's also vegetarian and free from gluten, wheat, peanuts and tree nuts, making it a suitable option for various dietary needs. However, the texture of the cauliflower crust wasn't my favorite — it was very thin and broke apart easily — and the pizza is lower in fiber and protein than many other cauliflower-based options.

Quest Uncured Pepperoni Pizza : This pepperoni pizza offers an impressive 28 grams of protein per serving and is low in carbs, making it a potentially good option for those following a low-carb diet. That said, I wasn't a huge fan of the crust. The pizza is also very high in saturated fat and sodium, with one serving providing 40% of the daily value for both nutrients.

California Pizza Kitchen Uncured Pepperoni Mushroom & Sausage : This cauliflower crust pizza is gluten-free and has 12 grams of protein and 1 gram of fiber per serving. The mozzarella cheese and other toppings tasted great, but the crust was too thin and crackerlike to be my favorite option in the cauliflower crust category. I also didn't find it filling enough to justify the amount of calories and saturated fat.

Daiya Supreme Pizza : As with all Daiya pizzas, the Supreme is vegan-friendly and gluten-free. I liked that it was generously topped with vegetables and plant-based ""sausage"" crumbles. I ultimately liked Blackbird's vegan ""meat"" pizza better, but this one is a good alternative if you can't find Blackbird or prefer a meatless sausage option instead.

Good & Gather Collabs Tavern Style Uncured Pepperoni & Jalapeño: This pizza packs a flavorful punch from the jalapeños and hot honey, plus has 15 grams of protein and 2 grams of fiber per serving. It's also made with uncured pepperoni and without artificial flavors or preservatives. However, it's quite high in saturated fat and sodium, and the crust didn't seem to bake as evenly as others we tried.

FAQs

Can I eat healthier frozen pizzas if I'm trying to lose weight?

Yes, frozen pizza can absolutely fit into a healthy diet for weight loss. Aim for pizzas that are high in fiber and protein and contain 300 to 400 calories per serving. To round out the meal, pair your pizza with a lower-calorie veggie-packed side, like a salad or a bowl of steamed mixed vegetables.

Should I eat frozen pizza regularly?

Everyone has different diet goals. While some frozen pizzas are healthier than others, these foods are still more highly processed and should be enjoyed in moderation. Instead, enjoy frozen pizza as part of an overall healthy diet, including plenty of home-cooked meals and minimally processed foods, like lean proteins, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds.

Is frozen pizza highly processed?

Most frozen pizzas are highly processed. To choose a less processed option, look for a frozen pizza with a relatively short ingredient list that's free of artificial additives and contains more recognizable ingredients, such as tomatoes, roasted vegetables and herbs like basil or oregano.

At a Glance By analyzing subtle facial movements, researchers found ways to objectively measure the severity of tinnitus and sound sensitivity disorder symptoms.

Better measures of symptom severity could aid in evaluating potential treatments.

Mass Eye and Ear

About 12% of adults experience chronic tinnitus, a persistent ringing, buzzing or clicking sound in the ears. This is often accompanied by heightened sensitivity to sounds, called hyperacusis, in which sounds that don’t bother most people become uncomfortable. There are currently no ways to measure these symptoms objectively. Instead, doctors must rely on subjective questionnaires to gauge disease severity.

A research team led by Dr. Daniel Polley at Massachusetts Eye and Ear examined whether certain sounds could elicit unconscious or involuntary responses. These responses, they reasoned, might predict the severity of tinnitus and hyperacusis. They compared 47 people with chronic tinnitus or sound sensitivity to 50 people without either condition. Results of the study, which was funded in part by NIH, appeared in Science Translational Medicine on April 30, 2025.

The team first recorded electrical activity in the participants’ brains. This allowed them to measure how neural activity increases with sound intensity, which is called central auditory neural gain. Excess central auditory gain has been proposed as a possible cause of tinnitus and hyperacusis. They found that people with disordered hearing had higher central auditory gain on average than people with normal hearing. But central gain didn’t correlate with symptom severity as measured by standard questionnaires.

Emotional stimuli can elicit unconscious physiological responses. For example, pupil dilation can be one sign of increased arousal. The researchers recorded participants’ faces while they listened to various emotionally evocative sounds, such as music or unpleasant animal noises. Pupil diameter increased sharply about a half-second after sound onset. The less pleasant the sound, the greater the dilation. In participants with disordered hearing, pupils dilated more for all sounds than in those with normal hearing. Also, pupil dilation was correlated with how severe people reported their tinnitus and hyperacusis to be.

In addition, the team was able to identify subtle involuntary facial movements that occurred in response to the sounds. Pleasant sounds elicited movements around the corners of the mouth. Unpleasant sounds triggered tightening of the muscles around the eyes and forehead. These facial movements tended to be less pronounced in participants with disordered hearing.

Pupil dilation and facial movements accurately reflected questionnaire scores for tinnitus severity. They also tracked with hyperacusis severity scores, although not as accurately as with tinnitus severity.

The results suggest that disrupted sound processing in people with tinnitus and hyperacusis causes unconscious physiological responses. With further development, this system might be used in health clinics and clinical trials to objectively measure the severity of these conditions. Better measures of symptom severity would improve our ability to assess potential treatments for these conditions.

“What’s really exciting is this vantage point into tinnitus severity didn’t require highly specialized brain scanners; instead, the approach was relatively low-tech,” Polley says.

Jackie and her three daughters have a family history of breast cancer

More than 1,200 patients a year in the UK could benefit from the change in practice if a larger clinical trial can confirm the findings.

Giving them the targeted drug olaparib before surgery greatly reduced the chances of the cancer coming back.

The trial, led by Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, and published in Nature Communications, involved women with early-stage breast cancer who have inherited BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutations.

A new treatment approach can significantly improve survival rates for patients with aggressive, inherited breast cancer, a study suggests.

The Hollywood star Angelina Jolie raised awareness of inherited breast cancer genes in 2013 when she had a double mastectomy to cut her risk of getting the disease.

'I'm cancer free'

Jackie Van Bochoven, 59, from Cambridgeshire, has a family history of breast cancer and carries a faulty copy of the BRCA1 gene, which significantly raises her risk of the disease during her lifetime.

She was diagnosed with an aggressive breast tumour in 2019 and took part in the trial.

""When I had the diagnosis I was completely shocked,"" she told BBC News.

""Six years on, I'm well and cancer free. It's amazing.""

Jackie's mother and sister both had breast cancer. She has three daughters and the eldest, Danielle, also carries the inherited BRCA gene mutation.

""For my future generations, if they have got the BRCA gene, it is a new hope,"" Jackie said.

Around one in 400 people carry mutations in either the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes.

Cancer Research UK estimates about seven in 10 women with changes in these genes will develop breast cancer, compared to about one in seven women without these mutations.

For men with BRCA mutations, the risks of developing breast cancer are much lower.

Olaparib is the first targeted drug treatment for cancers with mutations in the BRCA genes and is given as a tablet. It works by stopping cancer cells from being able to repair their DNA by blocking a protein called PARP, which causes the cancerous cells to die.

The trial, named Partner, took place at 23 sites in England, Scotland and Wales. Before surgery, 39 women with early stage breast cancer were given olaparib, also known as Lynparza, together with chemotherapy.

They started olaparib tablets 48 hours after each chemotherapy infusion. After three years, all had survived.

By contrast there were six deaths among 45 women in the study who received chemotherapy before surgery but did not get olaparib.

Prof, Jean Abraham, a consultant at Addenbrooke's and professor of precision breast cancer medicine at the University of Cambridge, who led the trial, described the results as were ""really exciting"".

""It is rare that you see 100% survival at 36 months for this subtype of breast cancer. We're incredibly excited about the potential of this new approach.""

The findings have the potential to be applied to other BRCA-related cancers, such as ovarian, prostate and pancreatic."""|"A new treatment approach can significantly improve survival rates for patients with aggressive, inherited breast cancer, a study suggests.

It sounds like science fiction, but it’s real.

My recent study, which I conducted with colleagues, found that an AI model could guess whether a patient identified as Black or white from heart images with up to 96% accuracy – despite no explicit information about racial categories being given.

It’s a striking finding that challenges assumptions about the objectivity of AI and highlights a deeper issue: AI systems don’t just reflect the world – they absorb and reproduce the biases built into it.

First, it’s important to be clear: race is not a biological category. Modern genetics shows there is more variation within supposed racial groups than between them.

Race is a social construct, a set of categories invented by societies to classify people based on perceived physical traits and ancestry. These classifications don’t map cleanly onto biology, but they shape everything from lived experience to access to care.

Despite this, many AI systems are now learning to detect, and potentially act on, these social labels, because they are built using data shaped by a world that treats race as if it were biological fact.

AI systems are already transforming healthcare. They can analyse chest X-rays, read heart scans and flag potential issues faster than human doctors – in some cases, in seconds rather than minutes. Hospitals are adopting these tools to improve efficiency, reduce costs and standardise care.

Bias isn’t a bug – it’s built in

But no matter how sophisticated, AI systems are not neutral. They are trained on real-world data – and that data reflects real-world inequalities, including those based on race, gender, age, and socioeconomic status. These systems can learn to treat patients differently based on these characteristics, even when no one explicitly programs them to do so.

One major source of bias is imbalanced training data. If a model learns primarily from lighter skinned patients, for example, it may struggle to detect conditions in people with darker skin. Studies in dermatology have already shown this problem.

Even language models like ChatGPT aren’t immune: one study found evidence that some models still reproduce outdated and false medical beliefs, such as the myth that Black patients have thicker skin than white patients.

Sometimes AI models appear accurate, but for the wrong reasons – a phenomenon called shortcut learning. Instead of learning the complex features of a disease, a model might rely on irrelevant but easier to spot clues in the data.

Imagine two hospital wards: one uses scanner A to treat severe COVID-19 patients, another uses scanner B for milder cases. The AI might learn to associate scanner A with severe illness – not because it understands the disease better, but because it’s picking up on image artefacts specific to scanner A.

Now imagine a seriously ill patient is scanned using scanner B. The model might mistakenly classify them as less sick – not due to a medical error, but because it learned the wrong shortcut.

This same kind of flawed reasoning could apply to race. If there are differences in disease prevalence between racial groups, the AI could end up learning to identify race instead of the disease – with dangerous consequences.

In the heart scan study, researchers found that the AI model wasn’t actually focusing on the heart itself, where there were few visible differences linked to racial categories. Instead, it drew information from areas outside the heart, such as subcutaneous fat as well as image artefacts – unwanted distortions like motion blur, noise, or compression that can degrade image quality. These artefacts often come from the scanner and can influence how the AI interprets the scan.

In this study, Black participants had a higher-than-average BMI, which could mean they had more subcutaneous fat, though this wasn’t directly investigated. Some research has shown that Black individuals tend to have less visceral fat and smaller waist circumference at a given BMI, but more subcutaneous fat. This suggests the AI may have been picking up on these indirect racial signals, rather than anything relevant to the heart itself.

This matters because when AI models learn race – or rather, social patterns that reflect racial inequality – without understanding context, the risk is that they may reinforce or worsen existing disparities.

This isn’t just about fairness – it’s about safety.

Solutions

But there are solutions:

Diversify training data: studies have shown that making datasets more representative improves AI performance across groups – without harming accuracy for anyone else.

Build transparency: many AI systems are considered “black boxes” because we don’t understand how they reach their conclusions. The heart scan study used heat maps to show which parts of an image influenced the AI’s decision, creating a form of explainable AI that helps doctors and patients trust (or question) results – so we can catch when it’s using inappropriate shortcuts.

Treat race carefully: researchers and developers must recognise that race in data is a social signal, not a biological truth. It requires thoughtful handling to avoid perpetuating harm.

AI models are capable of spotting patterns that even the most trained human eyes might miss. That’s what makes them so powerful – and potentially so dangerous. It learns from the same flawed world we do. That includes how we treat race: not as a scientific reality, but as a social lens through which health, opportunity and risk are unequally distributed.

If AI systems learn our shortcuts, they may repeat our mistakes – faster, at scale and with less accountability. And when lives are on the line, that’s a risk we cannot afford."|"It’s a striking finding that challenges assumptions about the objectivity of AI and highlights a deeper issue: AI systems don’t just reflect the world – they absorb and reproduce the biases built into it.

302|https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/13/health/long-working-hours-study-scli-intl-wellness|Working long hours? It could be altering the structure of your brain|2025-05-13 00:00:00|"CNN —

Long working hours might not just be bad for you, they could also be altering the structure of your brain, a new study suggests.

The research, published Tuesday, found “significant changes” in the brains of people who were overworking, which is a combination of physical and emotional overexertion, as well as a lack of rest.

The research was conducted by two scientists at South Korea’s Chung-Ang University and Yonsei University, who followed 110 healthcare workers classified into “overworked” and “non-overworked” groups.

In South Korea, where 52 hours of work per week is the legal upper limit, overworking has become a public health concern.

The overworked group, clocking 52 hours or more each week, consisted of 32 people who were on average younger, in employment for less time and more highly educated in comparison to those working standard hours.

By comparing data from a different study and MRI scans, the researchers were able to use a neuroimaging technique to analyse the workers’ brain volume.

The technique allowed them to identify and compare differences in levels of gray matter in different regions of the brain, while the application of atlas-based analysis meant they could identify and label structures in brain scans.

“People who worked 52 or more hours a week displayed significant changes in brain regions associated with executive function and emotional regulation, unlike participants who worked standard hours,” researchers said in a press release.

Areas of the brain that showed an increase in volume include the middle frontal gyrus, which plays a major role in cognitive functions, attention, memory and language-related processes, as well as the insula, which is involved in emotional processing, self-awareness and understanding social context.

Researchers believe their findings suggest a “potential relationship” between having an increased workload and changes in these parts of the brain, providing a biological basis for the cognitive and emotional challenges reported by people who are overworked.

Joon Yul Choi, coauthor of the study and an assistant professor at Yonsei University’s Department of Biomedical Engineering, told CNN that these changes might be “at least in part, reversible” if environmental stressors are reversed. Still, returning to your brain’s baseline state could take much longer.

‘Important new evidence’

Previous research has also found evidence of the negative health impacts of long working hours. In 2021, joint research from the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that overworking led to more than 745,000 deaths in a year. Long hours have also been found to raise the risk of diabetes in women and contribute to a decline in cognitive ability.

While these behavioral and psychological consequences of overwork are well-known, the underlying neurological mechanisms and changes in anatomy are less understood, the study explained.

Frank Pega, who led the WHO-ILO 2021 study, told CNN that these latest findings constitute “important new evidence” that could help better understand how long working hours “radically” impact the physical health of workers.

Pega, a WHO technical officer who was not involved in this latest study, said the research supports WHO-ILO’s findings that “long working hours contribute the largest burden of disease of all occupational risk factors identified so far.”

However, the study’s small sample size and focus only on healthcare workers in South Korea makes it hard to generalize its results. “More studies in different populations are needed,” said Pega.

“While the results should be interpreted cautiously due to the exploratory nature of this pilot study, they represent a meaningful first step in understanding the relationship between overwork and brain health,” said the researchers.

As for anyone stuck working long hours? Now you might have a scientific basis to cut down on your time at work.

“Governments, employers, and workers can all take actions to protect workers’ health from long working hours,” advised Pega, citing laws, regulations and policies that can ensure healthy work hours.

“The results underscore the importance of addressing overwork as an occupational health concern,” said the study’s authors.

Jonny Gifford, principal research fellow at the Institute for Employment Studies in Brighton, England, who was not involved in the study, told CNN that the research “confirms some physiological reasons that working long hours affects our wellbeing.”

“The use of brain scanning equipment to give neurological explanations gives powerful new evidence linking overwork with structural changes in parts of the brain involved in executive function and emotional regulation,” he said.

“It’s a small study of 110 healthcare workers in Korea, but because it is based on robust neurological measures and concerns fundamental mechanisms (overwork and fatigue) that can affect anyone, the central findings are widely relevant,” Gifford added.

The study was published in the journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine."|"CNN —Long working hours might not just be bad for you, they could also be altering the structure of your brain, a new study suggests.

303|https://www.psypost.org/alcohol-use-has-particularly-negative-impact-on-individuals-with-adhd/|Alcohol use has particularly negative impact on individuals with ADHD|2025-05-13 14:00:25+00:00|"A study of individuals with alcohol use disorder in France found that the negative impact of problematic alcohol use on quality of life is greater in those with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) than in those without the condition. The adverse effects on quality of life appear to be amplified by dysfunctional efforts to manage the intense emotional dysregulation associated with ADHD under the influence of alcohol. The research was published in the Journal of Psychiatric Research.

Alcohol use disorder is a chronic condition marked by an inability to control alcohol consumption despite harmful consequences, resulting in significant distress or impairment. It involves a pattern of excessive drinking, strong cravings, and a loss of control over alcohol intake. Individuals with this disorder often experience withdrawal symptoms such as tremors, anxiety, and nausea when not drinking.

The severity of alcohol use disorder can range from mild to severe, depending on the number of symptoms present. Over time, it can lead to serious health problems, including liver disease, cardiovascular complications, and cognitive decline. Social and occupational functioning often deteriorates as individuals begin to neglect responsibilities and relationships due to their drinking.

Study author Amandine Luquiens and her colleagues aimed to examine how alcohol use affects quality of life in individuals with ADHD. In particular, they focused on the roles of impulsivity, emotional dysregulation, and maladaptive emotion regulation strategies in this relationship.

ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by persistent patterns of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that interfere with daily life. It typically begins in childhood but can continue into adulthood, affecting academic, occupational, and social functioning.

The researchers analyzed data from the beginning of the TRAIN study, a clinical trial in France investigating the efficacy of a cognitive training program for patients with alcohol use disorder. The sample included 206 individuals diagnosed with alcohol use disorder, 40 of whom also had ADHD. All participants were classified as being at high risk due to their drinking levels—defined as consuming over 60 grams of alcohol per day for men and over 40 grams per day for women during the previous four-week period. At the time of the study, participants had been abstinent for between 7 and 30 days.

Participants completed a series of assessments measuring ADHD symptoms (using the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale), health-related quality of life specific to alcohol use disorder (using the Alcohol Quality of Life Scale), impulsivity (using the Impulsive Behavior Scale), emotion regulation strategies (using the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire), emotion regulation difficulties (using the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale – Impulse Control Difficulties subscale), and alcohol-related cognitive impairment (using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment).

The results showed that alcohol use had a greater negative impact on quality of life in individuals with ADHD compared to those without the disorder. Participants who were highly impulsive or who had difficulties with emotional regulation tended to report lower quality of life as well. Individuals with ADHD were more likely to suppress emotional expression, which was associated with further declines in quality of life. Overall, the researchers concluded that dysfunctional efforts to cope with emotional dysregulation significantly contributed to reduced well-being in individuals with ADHD and alcohol use disorder.

“Our findings have direct clinical and therapeutic implications. They underscore the relevance of identifying patients’ preferred emotion regulation strategies and the need to work with them on the limits of expressive suppression in the context of ADHD in AUD [alcohol use disorder], and on more functional and less costly alternatives,” the study authors note.

The study sheds light on the specificities of the relationship between alcohol use and quality of life in individuals with alcohol use disorder who also suffer from ADHD. However, it should be noted that the design of the study does not allow any causal inferences to be derived from the results.

These nodules, made of decayed sensory neurons and support cells, were found in abundance in the sensory ganglia of diabetic organ donors.

The study reveals that these structures not only signal nerve degeneration but may also drive pain by sprouting aberrant, pain-sensing axons. This discovery could shift how diabetic nerve pain is treated, moving the focus toward early neuroprotection before these nodules form.

Key Facts:

A phenomenon largely ignored since its discovery 100 years ago appears to be a crucial component of diabetic pain, according to new research from The University of Texas at Dallas’ Center for Advanced Pain Studies (CAPS).

Findings from a new study, published in Nature Communications on May 5, suggest that cell clusters called Nageotte nodules are a strong indicator of nerve cell death in human sensory ganglia.

These could prove to be a target for drugs that would protect these nerves or help manage diabetic neuropathy.

“The key finding of our study is really a new view of diabetic neuropathic pain,” said Dr. Ted Price BS’97, Ashbel Smith Professor of neuroscience in the School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences, CAPS director and co-corresponding author of the study.

“We believe our data demonstrate that neurodegeneration in the dorsal root ganglion is a critical facet of the disease — which should really force us to think about the disease in a new and urgent way.”

Diabetic neuropathy is one of the most common forms of neuropathic pain and affects about 11 million people — nearly one-third of the 38 million diabetics in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It typically affects the extremities, causing sharp, shooting pain.

“Diabetic neuropathy can be debilitating,” said neuroscience research scientist Stephanie Shiers PhD’19, a co-corresponding author.

If that’s the case, the discovery could be an indicator of how to create treatment options. Credit: Neuroscience News

“Treatment options are not great, and if the underlying diabetes is not managed, people may require amputation due to damage to the peripheral nerves to the point of loss of sensation.”

With support from a Research Program Cooperative Agreement grant (U19) from the National Institutes of Health, Shiers and other scientists at CAPS are mapping human dorsal root ganglia and other sensory system tissue to understand human pain mechanisms.

“I found an abundance of these Nageotte nodules in a subset of the dorsal root ganglia recovered from organ donors. When I looked up the medical history on these samples, they were all from individuals with diabetes,” she said.

“These nodules were more prevalent in people with diabetes and even more so in those with diabetic neuropathy. Organ donors die from a range of conditions, so discovering these abnormalities in a large subset of the tissue with a similar medical history was a big break.”

Nageotte nodules are dead sensory neurons that have decayed, and what remains is a cluster of non-neuronal cells. They were first documented in 1922 in rabbits by the French neuroanatomist Jean Nageotte.

In the past 100 years, these nodules have been almost entirely ignored in the research literature, only appearing in about 20 papers, many of which are a half-century old.

“They appear to be a sign of degeneration where hyperglycemia reduces neuron viability,” Shiers said.

“Little has been documented about these structures’ molecular composition. Virtually nobody in the pain field had heard of them, and we knew almost nothing about their involvement in pain and neurodegeneration.”

In this study, Shiers and her colleagues sought to characterize Nageotte nodules at the molecular level.

Using histology and spatial sequencing, they demonstrated that Nageotte nodules are abundant in sensory ganglia of those with diabetic neuropathy. They are mainly composed of satellite glia and non-myelinating Schwann cells.

“Intertwined with the nodule is a bundle of axons: fibers of sensory neurons that look like little neuromas. The axons there appear to sprout from sensory neurons; they are pain-sensing fibers,” Shiers said.

“This appears to be a unique pathology — something never described before in humans.”

If that’s the case, the discovery could be an indicator of how to create treatment options.

“Spontaneous activity in these fibers may be what’s behind diabetic neuropathy,” Shiers said. “We also had several donors with other types of neuropathic conditions that weren’t diabetes-related, and their DRGs also had an abundance of Nageotte nodules.”

While the rare earlier papers mentioning Nageotte nodules are mostly case studies of single individuals, this study had samples from 90 people. Shiers said her documentation of axons sprouting in this manner is also novel — another aspect of this study that represents new territory.

“This could change our basic understanding of sensory neurons. Sensory neurons are not supposed to sprout fibers from their cell bodies; they have a unique shape that we call pseudounipolar, but these diabetic sensory neurons do not look pseudounipolar — they look multipolar.” Shiers said.

“We don’t know if this morphology is pathological or if we have lacked understanding of these cells in humans.”

Researchers can study human dorsal root ganglia from such a large selection of patients due to the work of the Southwest Transplant Alliance, a nonprofit organization that recovers donated organs and tissues for transplantation.

“The ability to give life to others through research is incredibly important to our donation community,” Southwest Transplant Alliance President and CEO Brad Adams said. “Knowing that your loved one’s gift led to incredible medical discoveries and advances such as this brings hope and healing to all who have lost a loved one.”

Price said, “The entire study would never have happened without them. This partnership is the most important thing that enables this work.”

Price said the research has led to new ways of thinking about neuropathy.

“In my view, one of the most important insights we gained from this work is thinking about treating diabetic neuropathic pain differently. I think what we need to focus on now is neuroprotection at early stages of disease so that these Nageotte nodules do not form in the first place.”

“Nageotte nodules in human dorsal root ganglia reveal neurodegeneration in diabetic peripheral neuropathy” by Ted Price et al. Nature Communications

Abstract

Nageotte nodules in human dorsal root ganglia reveal neurodegeneration in diabetic peripheral neuropathy

Nageotte nodules, first described in 1922 by Jean Nageotte, are clusters of non-neuronal cells that form after sensory neuron death.

Despite their historical recognition, little is known about their molecular identity nor their involvement in neuropathies that involve neuronal loss like diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN).

In this study, we molecularly characterize Nageotte nodules in dorsal root ganglia recovered from organ donors with DPN.

Here we show that Nageotte nodules are abundant in DPN sensory ganglia and account for 25% of all neurons.

Peripherin-and Nav1.7-positive dystrophic axons invade Nageotte nodules, forming small neuroma-like structures.

Using histology and spatial sequencing, we demonstrate that Nageotte nodules are mainly composed of satellite glia and non-myelinating Schwann cells that express SPP1 and are intertwined with sprouting sensory axons originating from neighboring neurons.

Our findings suggest that Nageotte nodules are an integral feature of dorsal root ganglion neurodegeneration, providing potential therapeutic targets for sensory neuron protection and pain management in DPN."|"This discovery could shift how diabetic nerve pain is treated, moving the focus toward early neuroprotection before these nodules form.

""Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.""



You’ve heard it for years: Age is just a number. But there’s been a huge focus lately on biological age, which is how old your cells are. There are a bunch of different ways to calculate this number, including tests you can order online. But researchers have just discovered a new way of calculating your biological age—and they say it’s the most accurate one you’ll find. It’s called the Health Octo Tool, and it uses a slew of different metrics to figure out your biological age.

Meet the experts: David Cutler, M.D., a family medicine physician at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA; Parul Goyal, M.D., a geriatrician at Vanderbilt Health in Nashville; Shabnam Salimi, M.D., Ph.D., physician-scientist and an investigator at the University of Washington Medicine Healthy Aging & Longevity Research Institute

Here’s why there’s so much buzz around it right now, plus why knowing your biological age may help you live longer.

What is the Health Octo Tool?

The Health Octo tool is a new health assessment tool that uses several metrics taken from a physical exam and routine lab tests. When used together, it can help determine a person’s biological age and predict their risk of disability and death, according to a scientific paper published in Nature Communications.

The tool centers around an aging concept called health entropy, which is how much molecular and cellular damage the body accumulates over time, as well as how that damage impacts organs and bodily systems.

To create the tool, the researchers analyzed data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging, analyzing participants’ medical history as well as data from physical exams and other medical tests. The researchers also included data from two other large studies on more than 45,000 adults.

The scientists created what they called a Body Organ Disease Number, which was based on the number of organ systems, like the cardiovascular, respiratory, and central nervous systems, that were impacted by disease. They also factored in whether a person had a history of cancer or stroke to get a score between one and 14.

The researchers also created something called a Speed-Body Clock and Speed-Body Age to break down how a person’s biological age impacts their walking speed (which is a common measure of function in older people). Also in the mix: Disability-Body Clock and Disability Body Age, which analyzes how getting older impacts the risk of developing cognitive and physical disability.

All of those metrics can be gathered from a person's medical history, physical exam, and test results to calculate a person’s aging process.

Ultimately, the researchers say that the Health Octo tool is better than major tests used for assessing biological age, including the frailty index, a widely-used test that looks at a person’s susceptibility to age-related health issues. The researchers found that the test can predict the odds of developing disability and death with 90% or higher accuracy.

What makes this better than other biological tests?

The Health Octo tool uses some of the same data from existing biological tests, but takes things a step further. Many of the tests that are currently used focus on the impact of certain diseases, but don’t consider how those diseases and minor disorders impact a person’s overall health, the researchers explained in the paper.

“Health decline is multi-dimensional,” says lead study author Shabnam Salimi, M.D., Ph.D., physician-scientist and an investigator at the University of Washington Medicine Healthy Aging & Longevity Research Institute. “So, we decided to develop a multi-dimensional health metric that captures intrinsic aging and rate of aging.”

What can knowing your biological age do for your overall health and longevity?

Knowing your biological age has become more of a fun health flex lately, but doctors say it’s important to know this number beyond bragging rights. “There is some value to seeing the things you should be doing,” says David Cutler, M.D., a family medicine physician at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA. Meaning, if you know your diet isn’t as clean as it should be, and your biological age is older than your chronological age (i.e. how many years you’ve been alive), it should be a wake-up call to do things differently.

“Biological aging mechanisms underlie accumulation of chronic diseases,” Dr. Salimi says. “So, translating health to rate of aging can help to better understand biological aging mechanisms and response to interventions that target biological age.”

Parul Goyal, M.D., a geriatrician at Vanderbilt Health in Nashville, agrees. “Knowing your biological age is a good tool so that patients are more aware of what their health looks like,” she says. “They can then make proactive, positive changes in their health to be more physically fit and emotionally engaged.”

While Dr. Cutler points out that “you probably know that you should be doing things differently anyway,” if you’re not on top of your health habits, he notes that a higher biological age may motivate some people to make changes. Of course, that doesn’t mean that it will. “Is that going to make people drink less, avoid smoking, and eat better? We don’t know,” Dr. Cutler says.

What do doctors recommend for healthy aging?

Doctors recommend doing a lot of different things to age in a healthy way, although none are shocking. Here’s the advice Dr. Cutler and Dr. Goyal share with their patients:

Eat a healthy, varied diet—ideally the Mediterranean diet.

Limit alcohol or avoid it entirely.

Don’t smoke or quit smoking.

Try to be active on a daily basis.

Stay on top of routine healthcare, including cancer screenings.

Wear a helmet when you ride a bike.

Use your seatbelt in the car.

Try to minimize stress in your life.

Focus on getting good sleep.

Try to stay mentally stimulated.

Socialize with friends and family.

Dr. Salimi says that she and her fellow researchers are now working on developing an app to make the Health Octo Tool easier to use.

306|https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/may/12/autoimmune-disease-inverse-vaccines|‘Inverse vaccines’: the promise of a ‘holy grail’ treatment for autoimmune diseases|2025-05-12 00:00:00|"Autoimmune diseases affect as many as 800 million people around the world – about one in 10 of us. From multiple sclerosis and lupus to type one diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, these conditions all share a common trait: the body’s own immune system turns against itself.

Current treatments aim to suppress that response, but dialing down the entire immune system comes at a steep cost: it leaves patients vulnerable to other illnesses and often requires daily, invasive care.

A revolution is now afoot, as researchers are developing a new approach that targets only the specific part of the immune system that’s gone rogue. These treatments are known as “inverse vaccines” because they suppress a particular part of the immune system, rather than amplifying it, as existing vaccines do.

“This is the holy grail,” says the Northwestern University immunologist Stephen Miller. “We want to use a scalpel rather than a sledgehammer to treat these diseases.”

Miller’s 2021 paper, published in 2022 in Gastroenterology, was the first to demonstrate that inverse vaccines could be effective in humans. The study looked at celiac disease, in which the immune system attacks the intestinal lining when it detects the presence of gluten, a protein found in wheat and other grains.

Over two weeks, 33 celiac patients who were in remission ingested gluten; about half had received the inverse vaccine beforehand, while the other half got a placebo. After two weeks, researchers examined the subjects’ intestinal lining and found that the inverse vaccine group had no damage, while the placebo group showed a noticeable worsening of symptoms.

It re-educates the immune system, so then it says: ‘OK, I’m good, I don’t need to attack this, because I see that it’s not a threat’ Jeffrey Hubbell, bioengineer

The basic idea of inverse vaccines rests on using certain synthetic nanoparticles attached to particular disease-related proteins – called antigens – as targeted messengers to retrain the immune system. The nanoparticles mimic dying human cells, a normal ongoing process. Although these dying cells are “foreign”, the immune system knows not to attack them. The immune system learns to ignore both the nanoparticles and the attached proteins, and stops attacking the body.

“What this does is, it re-educates the immune system,” says NYU bioengineer Jeffrey Hubbell. “So then it says: ‘OK, I’m good, I don’t need to attack this, because I see that it’s not a threat.’”

In 2023, Hubbell and his colleagues published a peer-reviewed paper in Nature showing that this method could halt the mouse version of multiple sclerosis (MS), a disease in which the immune system attacks nerve cells in the brain and body. Over the past eight months, Anokion, the company started by Hubbell and others to commercialize their work, has announced successful early trials in humans in both celiac disease and MS.

“There have been more than a few tears of happiness shed by me and my team when we’ve seen the clinical results,” Hubbell says.

The discovery that certain negatively charged molecules could retrain the immune system to stop attacking our own tissues was “absolute serendipity”, says the University of Calgary immunologist Pere Santamaria. He was among the first scientists to uncover this. “I would never have guessed it,” he says. “Not even in my wildest dreams.”

Santamaria has spent most of his career focusing on type one diabetes, a disease in which the immune system attacks the pancreas cells that produce insulin. Recently though, he has begun exploring inverse vaccines for other autoimmune disorders, including a disease called primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) that affects bile ducts in the liver. One advantage of working on PBC is that because it is rare, clinical trials don’t require nearly as many patients; as a result, the drug approval process can move more quickly. “And once we get approval for one indication, we may be able to go faster with others,” Santamaria says.

One of the key advantages of inverse vaccines is their broad versatility; it appears that the approach can work for a wide range of autoimmune diseases. “It works all the time in animals,” says Santamaria. “We’ve tried this in many different animal models of autoimmune disease.” (Of course, success in animal studies doesn’t automatically translate to success in humans.)

Last year, Bana Jabri, the director of Institut Imagine in Paris, cowrote a review of inverse vaccine efforts. She is cautiously optimistic about their potential, but also notes that the immune system is immensely complex. Some immune cells, for example, circulate throughout the body, while others reside permanently in specific tissues. Jabri says it’s not yet clear that current inverse immune treatments can affect both kinds of cells.

Another potential advantage: most researchers say that the effect will probably last for months or perhaps longer – similar to the pattern seen for many non-inverse vaccines. “The immune system is incredible,” Hubbell says. “It has a memory, and that memory lasts.” Currently, most treatments for autoimmune disease require more frequent treatment, often a regimen of daily medicine.

In addition, inverse vaccines seem to have benefits beyond autoimmunity. They may work for allergies, which also involve an overreaction by the immune system – in this case to a food or environmental trigger rather than one’s own body. In 2022, Miller and his colleague, the University of Michigan biomedical engineer Lonnie Shea, published a small study with mice with peanut allergy. The animals who received an inverse vaccine were able to consume significantly more peanuts without symptoms than those who did not get the vaccine.

Last month, Hubbell and several colleagues published a paper in Science Translational Medicine showing that their inverse vaccine could protect allergic mice from house dust mite antigens, a frequent cause of asthma, as well as antigens to chicken egg whites, a common experimental model for allergy. The protection held up through repeated exposures to the allergens over several months.

And last year, Shea, the University of Michigan biomedical engineer, published a paper looking at alpha-gal syndrome, a potentially severe allergy to meat caused by tick bites. Infected mice who were given an inverse vaccine showed significantly fewer symptoms than those who were given a placebo. “We were able to basically convince the immune system that these proteins are not dangerous,” Shea says.

At this point, it is difficult to say how long it will be before inverse vaccines are approved for human use. Miller, Shea, Hubbell, Santamaria and other researchers are involved in startup biotech companies working to develop them. Some larger pharmaceutical companies are also bullish on the approach, and are partnering with startups.

In December, Genentech announced a partnership with Cour, the company started by Miller and Shea, that could be worth up to $900m. Last year, Parvus, the startup founded by Santamaria, entered into a collaboration with the pharmaceutical company AbbVie. Several inverse vaccines are now in the midst of or about to start phase two trials, small studies looking at how effective the treatment is in humans.

Some scientists estimate that the first inverse vaccines could be available for use in three to five years. Others are less certain. “I think it will take 10 years to have it nailed down,” Jabri says. “But it could be shorter, or it could be longer.”

Even so, nearly all are optimistic. “Twenty years ago, I would have told you this wasn’t possible, absolutely not,” says Miller. “Today, I can say that it will happen. No doubt.”"|"These treatments are known as “inverse vaccines” because they suppress a particular part of the immune system, rather than amplifying it, as existing vaccines do.

Any disruption, even slight, can rapidly trigger Alzheimer’s-like damage.

For the first time, researchers have shown using living human brain tissue how a toxic variant of a protein associated with Alzheimer’s disease can attach to and damage the connections between brain cells.

The study used small samples of healthy brain tissue obtained during routine neurosurgical procedures. These samples were exposed to amyloid beta, a protein linked to the development of Alzheimer’s.

Unlike the response to the normal form of amyloid beta, the brain tissue did not attempt to repair the damage caused by the toxic version.

The study also found that even small changes in the natural levels of amyloid beta, either increasing or decreasing, were enough to disrupt brain cells. This suggests the brain requires a finely tuned ‘sweet spot’ of the protein to function properly, experts say.

Researchers at the University of Edinburgh hope the discoveries will allow them to hone in on drugs that have the best chance of preventing the loss of synapses – connections which allow the flow of messages between brain cells and are vital to healthy brain function.

Alzheimer’s disease attacks synapses, and their loss strongly predicts reduced memory and thinking abilities.

Keeping Human Brain Tissue Alive in the Lab

Central to the early success of the Dyson RAD Dementia Research Acceleration Project has been the pioneering method that keeps tiny fragments of human brain alive in laboratory dishes for several weeks after collection, with the patient’s permission.

This innovative approach offers a rare and powerful opportunity to investigate the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease in living human brain cells.

Researchers also discovered that brain slices taken from the temporal lobe, a region known to be affected early in Alzheimer’s, released higher levels of another key disease protein, called tau. This may help explain why this part of the brain is particularly vulnerable in the early stages of the condition, as increased tau release may enable faster spread of toxic forms of this protein between cells.

In addition, a number of the samples were found to contain early indicators of Alzheimer’s, such as amyloid plaques and tau tangles, demonstrating the potential of this model to study the disease before symptoms appear.

Accelerating Drug Discovery

Experts say this innovative approach will make it easier to test experimental drugs before they enter clinical trials, increasing the chance of finding drugs that work in the human brain.

The study is published in Nature Communications and was supported by a fellowship from Race Against Dementia (RAD) – a charity formed by Sir Jackie Stewart following his wife’s dementia diagnosis – and a £1 million donation from the James Dyson Foundation – Sir James Dyson’s charity that supports medical research and engineering education. The donation helped employ two scientists, secure time from research nurses, and obtain the cutting-edge laboratory equipment needed for working with living human brain tissue.

The project links experts from Formula One and Dyson with early-career researchers to accelerate progress towards a cure for dementia. It marries best practice from these fast-paced, innovative industries with novel scientific techniques to investigate the biology of human brain tissue.

Dr Claire Durrant, RAD Dyson Fellow and UK Dementia Research Institute Emerging Leader at the Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences at the University of Edinburgh, said: “Working alongside the neurosurgical team at the University of Edinburgh, we have shown that living human brain slices can be used to explore fundamental questions relating to Alzheimer’s disease. We believe this tool could help accelerate findings from the lab into patients, bringing us one step closer to a world free from the heartbreak of dementia.

“These findings are a testament to the incredible support of my funders and the hard work of my team members Dr Robert McGeachan and Dr Soraya Meftah who led on the experiments.”

Voices from the Frontlines of Dementia Research

Sir Jackie Stewart OBE, founder of Race Against Dementia, which has supported Dr Durrant’s laboratory since 2019, said: “It’s a horrendous reality that as things stand, one in three people born today, will die with dementia. Someone develops dementia every three seconds – and we still don’t have a cure. I created Race Against Dementia to challenge this awful disease in the fullest sense. Our collaboration across industries allows us to think keener and faster and the breakthrough that we have achieved shows what is possible when science moves faster, with new tools and fresh thinking. Our unique program is enabling us to test potential treatments which are bringing us closer to a world without dementia. I am sure that for you, like me, that cannot happen soon enough.”

James Dyson, Founder of Dyson, said: “I’ve been delighted to support Dr Durrant’s novel approach. Working with brain surgeons and their consenting patients nationwide to collect samples of living human brain and keep them alive in the lab is a groundbreaking method. It allows researchers to better examine Alzheimer’s disease on real human brain cells rather than relying on animal substitutes, such as mice. Dr Durrant’s findings show that she is progressing towards solving one of the most devastating problems of our time.”

Professor Tara Spires-Jones, Group Leader at the UK Dementia Research Institute at the University of Edinburgh, said: “This important work by Dr Durrant’s team brings a new tool to scientists’ toolbox to better understand Alzheimer’s disease and how to treat it. The use of living human tissue samples generously donated by people undergoing surgery to remove brain tumours allows scientists to probe how living human brain reacts to toxic proteins produced in Alzheimer’s, and in the future will allow testing of whether new treatments are effective in human brain. This cutting-edge study is an example of how the UK Dementia Research Institute is at the forefront of global efforts to understand and treat Alzheimer’s.”

As the weather turns warmer, a lot of us are spending more time outside, which means dog owners are on the lookout for ticks.

While people think of the spring and summer as tick season, a Maryland-based veterinarian said he sees more ticks in the fall months of October, November and December than he does in July and August.

“Ticks come out all year round,” said Dr. Victor Katz, of the Muddy Branch Veterinary Center in Gaithersburg. “If it gets to 32 degrees frost, they might be a little dormant, but as soon as it warms up to 35-37 degrees, they start moving around.”

A dog’s ambient temperature is 101 degrees. Ticks want to be warm and can sense temperature, humidity and movement.

“They basically hatch out and basically attach to the dogs. They just want to be warm,” Katz said.

There are several tick-related diseases prevalent in the D.C. region, including Lyme, ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis.

“They moved the epicenter for studying Lyme disease from Hartford, Connecticut, to Derwood, Maryland, about seven years ago,” Katz said. “We are in ‘Lyme central.’”

Katz pointed to monthly oral preventive medication, such as Simparica, Bravecto and NexGard, as the best way to keep your dogs safe from tick borne diseases.

“It does not put a bubble around the dog where it basically shoots the tick with laser beams or something like that,” he said.

But if a tick bites a dog that’s on an oral preventive, it will die in about four to six hours. Transmission of some of these diseases often takes up to 10 to 12 hours.

“So, it’s basically wiping the tick out before they get a chance to transmit enough of the disease to harm the dog,” he said.

There is data, according to Katz, that shows the preventatives might increase seizure potential in some dogs. He recommended for those dogs, using a Seresto tick collar that lasts about six months and, he said, “works really well.”

Despite the name, there are more than a dozen different types of diabetes. The classification isn’t quite as tidy as the numbering suggests.

Here’s a clear guide to the different types, including some that you may not have heard of, along with information about what causes them and how they are treated.

Type 1

Type 1 diabetes is caused by the body’s immune system mistakenly attacking the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. This autoimmune reaction can occur at any age, from infancy through to old age.

It is not linked to diet or lifestyle. Instead, it probably results from a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental triggers, such as viral infections.

Treatment involves lifelong insulin therapy, delivered through injections or pumps.

A small number of people who struggle with low blood sugars, called hypoglycaemia, can receive new cells in the pancreas that produce insulin from deceased donors. For many, this reduces the number of insulin injections needed. Some can stop taking their insulin altogether.

What’s more, dozens of people have now received stem-cell-derived transplants to effectively “cure” their diabetes, although people still need to take strong immune-suppressing drugs. This treatment is not yet widely available.

Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of the condition and is often linked to having a high BMI (body mass index). However, it can also affect people of normal weight, particularly those with a strong genetic predisposition.

Certain ethnic groups, including south Asians and people of African and Caribbean descent, are at higher risk – even at lower body weights.

Boosting the body’s production of insulin can help to control blood sugar levels. Some drugs boost insulin production from the pancreas, while others improve insulin sensitivity.

Metformin, for example, is taken by hundreds of millions of people worldwide. This drug improves insulin sensitivity and switches off sugar production by the liver.

There are dozens of different drugs to help control blood sugar in type 2 diabetes. Tailoring treatment to the individual has been shown to improve health outcomes significantly.

Lifestyle changes can also reverse diabetes. This can be done by keeping a low-calorie diet of 800 calories a day. In a research trial maintaining this diet for 12 months reversed diabetes in 46% of people.

Gestational diabetes

This type of diabetes develops during pregnancy, typically between weeks 24 and 28. It is triggered by hormonal changes that reduce the body’s sensitivity to insulin.

Risk factors include being overweight or obese, a family history of diabetes, and giving birth to a large baby in a previous pregnancy.

Those from Middle Eastern, south Asian, black and African Caribbean backgrounds are also at higher risk of gestational diabetes. Age is also a factor, as insulin sensitivity declines with age. This can be treated with diet and exercise, tablets or insulin injections.

Rarer forms of diabetes

There are at least nine sub-types of diabetes that include rare genetic forms, sometimes caused by a single genetic change. Others can be caused by treatment, such as surgery or drugs, such as steroids.

Neonatal diabetes appears early in life. Some of the genetic changes affect how insulin is released from the pancreas. Some people still make their own insulin, so can be treated with tablets that help pancreas cells to push out insulin.

Maturity onset diabetes of the young, or Mody, occurs later in life and is linked to genetic changes. There are several gene changes, with some affecting how pancreas cells sense sugar and others affecting how the pancreas develops.

Type 3c diabetes is different. It is caused by damage to the pancreas. People with pancreatic cancer, for example, can develop diabetes after parts of the pancreas are removed. It can also develop after pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas).

Those with cystic fibrosis are also at a higher risk of developing diabetes. This is called cystic fibrosis-related diabetes. The risk increases with age and is very common, with around a third of people with cystic fibrosis developing diabetes by the age of 40.

Type 5

This newly designated form is linked to malnutrition during early life. Type 5 diabetes is more common in poorer countries. It affects around 20-25 million people worldwide.

People have low body weight and lack insulin. But the lack of insulin is not caused by the immune system. Instead, the body may not have received the correct nutrition during childhood to help the pancreas develop normally.

Studies with rodents have shown that a low-protein diet during pregnancy or adolescence leads to poor pancreas development. This has been known for many years. Having a smaller pancreas is a risk factor for different forms of diabetes. Essentially, having fewer reserves of insulin-producing cells.

Diabetes is an umbrella term for a range of conditions that result in raised blood sugar levels, but the underlying causes vary widely. Understanding the specific types of diabetes someone has is crucial to providing the right treatment.

As medical science evolves, so does the classification of diabetes. Recognising malnutrition-related diabetes as type 5 will stimulate discussion. This is a step towards better global understanding and care – especially in low-income countries."|"Type 5 diabetes has just been recognised as a distinct form of diabetes by the International Diabetes Federation.

In a nutshell Older adults who sat longer each day showed faster brain shrinkage, even if they exercised regularly.

Sitting time was linked to worse memory and cognitive performance, especially in people with the APOE-ε4 gene.

Spending less time sitting may protect your brain as much as adding more exercise.

NASHVILLE — Are you reading this while lounging on your couch? You might want to stand up. New research shows that too much sitting could damage your brain, regardless of your exercise habits.

A study spanning seven years found that older adults who spent more hours sitting experienced faster brain shrinkage and mental decline – even among those who regularly worked out.

This finding challenges what many people believe: that regular exercise makes up for hours of sitting. According to the research, most participants were active enough to meet CDC guidelines for weekly physical activity. Yet their sedentary behavior still harmed their brain health.

The Hidden Cost of Being Sedentary

Researchers from Vanderbilt University’s Memory and Alzheimer’s Center followed 404 older adults (average age 71) for seven years, using wrist-worn activity monitors to accurately track movement patterns. On average, participants sat for about 13 hours daily – a number that might seem high until you add up your own sitting time from commuting, desk work, meals, and evening relaxation.

The brain changes linked to more sitting occurred in regions that are typically vulnerable to Alzheimer’s disease. People who sat more showed thinning in these areas and performed worse on memory tests that asked them to recall past experiences and events.

Over time, those who sat more lost hippocampal volume faster and showed greater declines in their ability to name objects and process information quickly. The hippocampus, which helps form memories, is among the first brain regions affected by Alzheimer’s disease.

Genetic Risk Factors Amplify the Problem

Most concerning was that sitting had worse effects on carriers of the APOE-ε4 gene variant, which increases Alzheimer’s risk. When researchers separated participants by genetic status, they discovered that APOE-ε4 carriers who sat more showed significantly greater reductions in total brain matter, frontal lobe volume, and parietal lobe volume compared to non-carriers with similar sitting habits.

The study, published in Alzheimer’s & Dementia, found that “APOE-ε4 carriers appear to be at increased risk for neurodegeneration associated with greater sedentary behavior, independent of physical activity level.”

While previous studies have connected too much sitting with heart disease, diabetes, and cancer, this research strengthens the evidence that brain health belongs on that list. Researchers believe that prolonged sitting may harm blood vessels in the brain, increase inflammation, and reduce connections between brain cells.

How the Study Worked

The research team used advanced equipment that measured movement 30 times per second. This allowed them to distinguish between sitting still, light activity like casual walking, and more vigorous movement far more accurately than asking people to recall their activity levels.

Each participant completed extensive cognitive testing and underwent detailed brain scans at the beginning of the study and during follow-up visits. Researchers analyzed various brain regions and something they called an “AD-neuroimaging signature” – a measurement of brain thickness in areas typically affected by Alzheimer’s.

What makes this study particularly valuable is that it controlled for physical activity, allowing researchers to isolate the specific effects of sitting. This reveals that even if you follow exercise guidelines religiously, spending most of your remaining hours sitting could still harm your brain.

Protecting Your Brain Health

With smartphones and artificial intelligence making it easier and easier for people to do countless tasks without getting up, it’s no surprise Americans are becoming increasingly sedentary. The average older adult spends over 9 hours sitting daily, according to previous research mentioned in the study. And that was before the pandemic pushed many people toward even less active lifestyles.

For anyone worried about brain health, the message is clear: cutting sitting time matters just as much as increasing exercise. Standing desks, movement breaks throughout the day, and finding ways to add more motion to daily routines could help protect against cognitive decline.

The evidence points to an important conclusion: what you do between workouts matters just as much as the workouts themselves. Your brain health depends not just on making time for exercise, but on minimizing time spent sitting still."|"New research shows that too much sitting could damage your brain, regardless of your exercise habits.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.

CNN —

Pressed into a piece of rock is the flattened, 47 million-year-old body of a cicada. Measuring about 1 inch (26.5 millimeters) long with a wingspan of 2.7 inches (68.2 millimeters), its fossilized form is nearly intact, with its veined wings spread wide.

Scientists recently described the insect as a new genus and species, using this fossil and one other that was nearly as well preserved, from the same site. Even though the specimens are female, their location on the cicada family tree suggests that males of this species could sing as modern cicadas do. Found in Germany decades ago, their presence there reveals that singing cicadas dispersed in Europe millions of years earlier than once thought.

The fossils are also the oldest examples of “true” singing cicadas in the family Cicadidae, researchers reported April 29 in the journal Scientific Reports. Most modern cicadas belong to this family, including annual cicadas that appear every summer worldwide, as well as broods of black-bodied and red-eyed periodical cicadas, which emerge from May to June in eastern North America in cycles of 13 or 17 years. Brood XIV, one of the biggest broods, emerges across a dozen US states this year. Cicadas are found on every continent except Antarctica, and there are more than 3,000 species.

The fossil record for insects in general is abundant in just a few dozen locations, and while modern cicada species are numerous today, paleontologists have documented only 44 Cicadidae fossils. The earliest definitive fossil of a singing cicada was discovered in Montana and dates from 59 million to 56 million years ago, said lead study author Dr. Hui Jiang, a paleontologist and researcher with the Bonn Institute of Organismic Biology at the University of Bonn in Germany. Its newly described relative is the earliest singing cicada from Europe, Jiang told CNN in an email.

Because the body structures of the European fossils were so well preserved, scientists were able to assign the ancient insect to a modern tribe of cicadas called Platypleurini, “which is today primarily distributed in tropical and subtropical regions of sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, but is absent from Europe,” Jiang said.

Prior research suggested that this lineage evolved in Africa about 30 million to 25 million years ago and dispersed from there, according to Jiang. “This fossil pushes back the known fossil record of sound-producing cicadas in the tribe Platypleurini by approximately 20 million years, indicating that the diversification of this group occurred much earlier than previously recognized,” the researcher added.

The discovery hints that this group of cicadas evolved more slowly than prior estimates from molecular data proposed, said Dr. Conrad Labandeira, a senior research geologist and curator of fossil arthropods at the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History in Washington, DC.

“This suggests that older fossils of the Platypleurini are yet to be discovered,” said Labandeira, who was not involved in the research. “Such discoveries would assist in providing better calibrations for determining a more realistic evolutionary rate.”

Researchers named the cicada Eoplatypleura messelensis. Its name refers to where the specimens were discovered: the Messel Pit in Germany, a rich fossil site dating to the Eocene epoch (57 million to 36 million years ago). Excavated in the 1980s, the fossils have since been in the collection of the Senckenberg Research Institute and Natural History Museum Frankfurt in Germany, said senior study author Dr. Sonja Wedmann, head of Senckenberg’s paleoentomology department.

A very deep volcanic lake, with a bottom where no oxygen penetrated, once filled the Messel Pit. That environment created ideal conditions for fossilization, and fine-grain sediments from this former lake bed hold a variety of Eocene life, Wedmann told CNN in an email.

“The excellent preservation not only of insects, but of all groups of organisms, is the reason why Messel is an UNESCO world heritage site,” a designation it earned in 1995, Wedmann said.

The more complete of the two cicada fossils “is one of the best preserved insects from the Messel pit fossil site,” Wedmann added. “Senckenberg has a collection of over 20,000 fossil insects from Messel, and among these it stands out because of its really beautiful and complete preservation.”

In its overall head and body shape, E. messelensis strongly resembles modern cicadas. Its rostrum — a snoutlike mouth — is intact, but closer analysis is needed to tell whether it used the rostrum for feeding on plant tissues called xylem, as most modern cicadas do, Labandeira said.

E. messelensis also shows hints of colors and patterns in its wings. This feature camouflages modern cicadas as they cling to tree trunks, and it may have served a similar purpose for E. messelensis, according to Jiang.

However, E. messelensis differs from modern cicadas in subtle ways. For example, its forewings are broader and less elongated than those of species alive today, which may have affected how it flew.

Would the ancient cicada’s call have sounded like those of its modern relatives? “We can’t know the exact song,” Jiang said. However, based on the cicada’s body shape and placement in the singing cicada group, “it likely produced sounds similar in function to modern cicadas.”

When Brood XIV emerges in the billions in the late spring and early summer of 2025, their calls will measure from 90 to 100 decibels — as loud as a subway train. Other types of cicadas produce an even bigger ruckus: Songs of the African cicada Brevisana brevis peak at nearly 107 decibels, about as loud as a jet taking off.

The volume of the ancient species’ songs may have been even louder than that, Jiang said. The abdomen of E. messelensis is broader and larger than those of its modern relatives, suggesting that males could have had a larger resonating cavity. This cavity may have amplified sound from the vibrating structures in their abdomens, called tymbals, to produce a louder buzz.

“Of course, this is only a hypothesis,” Jiang added. “Future studies on how morphology relates to sound production in modern cicadas will help to test it.”

They report that key features of OSA—intermittent hypoxia (IH) and sleep fragmentation (SF)—trigger biological processes such as neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, neuronal injury, altered synaptic plasticity, and blood-brain barrier dysfunction, all of which contribute to cognitive decline.

Disease severity and duration are strongly linked to poorer memory performance, with measures like the Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI) correlating with the extent of impairment.

While continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy remains the most effective treatment for protecting cognitive function, the authors stress the need for additional therapies and more precise diagnostic tools to identify and manage OSA-related memory dysfunction.

Early changes observed through brain imaging, EEG, and blood biomarkers may serve as emerging predictors of cognitive decline.

The review was co-authored by Drs. Xiaoman Zhang, Huajun Xu, and Shankai Yin of Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and Drs. David Gozal and Abdelnaby Khalyfa of Marshall University.

Dr. Zhang completed a six-month research scholar program in Khalyfa’s lab at Marshall University, collaborating with Khalyfa and the team to develop this review article.

The authors also highlight future research directions, including the role of gut microbiota, genetic factors, and epigenetic changes in OSA-related memory decline. They suggest that multidimensional clinical profiling could support the development of personalized treatment strategies.

Abstract

Obstructive sleep apnea and memory impairments: Clinical characterization, treatment strategies, and mechanisms

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), is associated with dysfunction in the cardiovascular, metabolic and neurological systems.

However, the relationship between OSA and memory impairment, intervention effects, and underlying pathways are not well understood.

This review summarizes recent advances in the clinical characterization, treatment strategies, and mechanisms of OSA-induced memory impairments.

OSA patients may exhibit significant memory declines, including impairments in working memory from visual and verbal sources.

The underlying mechanisms behind OSA-related memory impairment are complex and multifactorial with poorly understood aspects that require further investigation.

Neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, neuronal damage, synaptic plasticity, and blood-brain barrier dysfunction, as observed under exposures to intermittent hypoxia and sleep fragmentation are likely contributors to learning and memory dysfunction.

Continuous positive airway pressure treatment can provide remarkable relief from memory impairment in OSA patients.

Other treatments are emerging but need to be rigorously evaluated for cognitive improvement.

Clinically, reliable and objective diagnostic tools are necessary for accurate diagnosis and clinical characterization of cognitive impairments in OSA patients.

The complex links between gut-brain axis, epigenetic landscape, genetic susceptibility, and OSA-induced memory impairments suggest new directions for research.

Characterization of clinical phenotypic clusters can facilitate advances in precision medicine to predict and treat OSA-related memory deficits."|"Summary: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) contributes to significant memory decline, especially in visual and verbal working memory, according to a new review of human and animal studies.

ROACH: I recently read this morning that the shingles vaccine, Shingrix, “may have a protective effect against dementia.” It goes on to say the studies that have been conducted so far are only observational. Is this something that you could address? -- J.S.B.

ANSWER: There have been several studies showing that people who get a shingles vaccine (either the old one, Zostavax, which is no longer given, or the current vaccine, Shingrix, which provides longer-lasting benefit) are at a lower risk for developing dementia. However, in these kinds of studies, sometimes the people who get the vaccine are generally healthier and less likely to develop dementia anyway, so it’s impossible to be 100% sure that the vaccine is actually lowering the risk of dementia.

In the recent study that the news article was referring to, a change in the recommendations of who should get the shingles vaccine in the United Kingdom led to a large group of people being recommended the vaccine, while another large group of people who were almost the same age weren’t recommended the vaccine. In this way, the study was much closer to a randomized trial, which provides the highest degree of the evidence of a benefit.

In this study, those who had the Zostavax vaccine had a 3.5% point reduction in a new dementia diagnosis over seven years, which is equivalent to a 20% relative reduction in risk. The Shingrix vaccine would be expected to have an even greater benefit.

It has long been known that shingles increases the risk of stroke. Inflammation in the brain and blood vessels are suspected to cause the roughly double risk of stroke that is seen shortly after an episode of shingles. The increased risk for stroke goes down with time but is still present even a year after shingles.

Multiple stroke episodes are a leading cause of dementia, so it is biologically plausible that preventing shingles can reduce dementia by preventing blood vessel damage and strokes, although there may be other mechanisms at work.

Not getting painful shingles and its complication, post-herpetic neuralgia, is a good enough reason to recommend the shingles vaccine, but this new information makes getting the vaccine more important for adults over 50, even if they’ve had shingles or the old Zostavax vaccine.

DEAR DR. ROACH: I read that papaya seeds will clear out intestinal parasites. Should I use it? -- V.P.

ANSWER: I have heard about this as a social media trend. Studies in Africa, where there is a high rate of infection from worms like Ascaris (roundworm), Trichuris (whipworm) and Ancylostoma (hookworm), showed that dried papaya seeds decreased the rates of carriage. However, the risk of these worms in most areas of the United States and Canada is low.

Furthermore, the medications we have for diagnosed intestinal worms are much more effective than papaya seeds. The dosing and preparation of the seeds needs to be done carefully, and even when it’s properly done, there can be side effects. People with suspected intestinal parasites should get a medical evaluation instead of trying therapies that aren’t as effective as the standard ones and can’t treat the condition at hand.

How are we able to recall a word we want to say?

This basic ability, called word retrieval, is often compromised in patients with brain damage. Interestingly, many patients who can name words they see, like identifying a pet in the room as a “cat”, struggle with retrieving words in everyday discourse.

Scientists have long sought to understand how the brain retrieves words during speech. A new study by researchers at New York University sheds light on this mystery, revealing a left-lateralized network in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex that plays a crucial role in naming.

The findings, published in Cell Reports, provide new insights into the neural architecture of language, offering potential applications for both neuroscience and clinical interventions.

Mapping the Brain’s Naming Network

Word retrieval is a fundamental aspect of human communication, allowing us to link concepts to language. Despite decades of research, the exact neural dynamics underlying this process — particularly in natural auditory contexts — remain poorly understood.

NYU researchers — led by Biomedical Engineering Graduate Student Leyao Yu and Associate Professor of Biomedical Engineering at NYU Tandon and Neurology at NYU Grossman School of Medicine Adeen Flinker — recorded electrocorticographic (ECoG) data from 48 neurosurgical patients to examine the spatial and temporal organization of language processing in the brain.

By using unsupervised clustering techniques, the researchers identified two distinct but overlapping networks responsible for word retrieval.

The first, a semantic processing network, was located in the middle and inferior frontal gyri. This network was engaged in integrating meaning and was sensitive to how surprising a word was within a given sentence.

The second, an articulatory planning network, was situated in the inferior frontal and precentral gyri, which played a crucial role in speech production, regardless of whether words were presented visually or auditorily.

Auditory Naming and the Prefrontal Cortex

The study builds upon decades of work in language neuroscience. Previous research suggested that different regions of the brain were responsible for retrieving words depending on whether they were seen or heard.

However, earlier studies relied on methods with limited temporal resolution, leaving many unanswered questions about how these networks interact in real time.

By leveraging the high spatial and temporal resolution of ECoG, the researchers uncovered a striking ventral-dorsal gradient in the prefrontal cortex.

They found that while articulatory planning was localized ventrally, semantic processing was uniquely represented in a dorsal region of the inferior frontal gyrus and middle frontal gyrus — a previously underappreciated hub for language processing.

“These findings suggest that a missing piece in our understanding of language processing lies in this dorsal prefrontal region,” explains lead author Leyao Yu.

“Our study provides the first direct evidence that this area is involved in mapping sounds to meaning in an auditory context.”

Implications for Neuroscience and Medicine

The study has far-reaching implications, not only for theoretical neuroscience but also for clinical applications. Language deficits, such as anomia — the inability to retrieve words — are common in stroke, brain injury, and neurodegenerative disorders.

Understanding the precise neural networks involved in word retrieval could lead to better diagnostics and targeted rehabilitation therapies for patients suffering from these conditions.

Additionally, the study provides a roadmap for future research in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and neuroprosthetics.

By decoding the neural signals associated with naming, scientists could potentially develop assistive devices for individuals with speech impairments, allowing them to communicate more effectively through direct brain-computer communication.

For now, one thing is clear: our ability to name the world around us is not just a simple act of recall, but the result of a sophisticated and finely tuned neural system — one that is now being revealed in greater detail than ever before.

Abstract

A left-lateralized dorsolateral prefrontal network for naming

The ability to connect the form and meaning of a concept, known as word retrieval, is fundamental to human communication.

While various input modalities could lead to identical word retrieval, the exact neural dynamics supporting this process relevant to daily auditory discourse remain poorly understood.

Here, we recorded neurosurgical electrocorticography (ECoG) data from 48 patients and dissociated two key language networks that highly overlap in time and space, critical for word retrieval.

Using unsupervised temporal clustering techniques, we found a semantic processing network located in the middle and inferior frontal gyri.

This network was distinct from an articulatory planning network in the inferior frontal and precentral gyri, which was invariant to input modalities.

Functionally, we confirmed that the semantic processing network encodes word surprisal during sentence perception.

These findings elucidate neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the processing of semantic auditory inputs ranging from passive language comprehension to conversational speech."|"Researchers used high-resolution electrocorticography in 48 patients to reveal that semantic processing and articulatory planning occur in neighboring yet functionally distinct regions.

MURRAY — Ann Itchon says she will never forget the sound of her husband falling in the bathroom the night he suffered a stroke.

On Jan. 23, 2024, Ted Itchon woke up around 2 a.m. to use the bathroom and lost his balance, causing him to collapse onto the floor. Ann found him quickly after and called 911. She says she had no idea what was wrong until she overheard a paramedic saying Ted might be having a stroke.

In the time it took Ann Itchon to leave their house and meet her husband at the hospital emergency room, first responders had already assessed Ted and provided him a stroke-stopping medication that prevented further damage to his brain.

Dr. Paul Johnson, medical director of the Comprehensive Stroke Program at Intermountain Medical Center, and the neurologist who treated Ted Itchon that night, explained that medical staff work as fast as possible when treating a stroke patient because, for every second they are experiencing a stroke, 32,000 neurons in the brain die.

""A stroke is a very time-sensitive disease. When somebody is having a stroke, it's just a matter of time until you have a permanent brain injury,"" said Johnson. ""We often say, in the stroke world, that 'time is brain.' Every minute you delay care, it costs brain cells. The sooner somebody comes into the hospital, the sooner we can intervene and prevent that injury from happening.""

Utah was recently ranked as the top state for providing the fastest stroke treatment in the nation by the American Heart Association, according to Intermountain Health.

The American Heart Association recommends that patients receive a tissue plasminogen activator medication to dissolve blood clots in the brain within 60 minutes of arriving at the hospital. In Utah, 87.1% of stroke patients received the medication within 45 minutes of their arrival, making it the only state in the country reaching that goal for over 85% of patients. Furthermore, Intermountain Health reports 94.5% of patients arriving at its stroke centers receive the medication within 45 minutes, and 88% receive it in 30 minutes or less.

To improve its door-to-needle time, Johnson says Intermountain Health has implemented changes such as having the blood clot-dissolving medication premixed, expediting CT scans, and improving the emergency department workflow overall. The health care system also has a stroke neurologist on staff 24/7 to ensure patients can be diagnosed and treated as quickly as possible.

""We have been able to treat patients very quickly because we — along with our sister hospitals in the state — have focused very intensely on assessing patients, when they come to the hospitals, as quickly as possible,"" said Johnson. ""We have worked very closely with EMS crews, with the ER doctors, with our nurses in the ER, to make sure that we shave off every minute that we can ... so that when a patient like Ted comes in, we are very quickly able to get the data that we need.""

When a patient arrives at the emergency room, medical staff must be able to determine definitively that the patient is having a stroke before administering the medication to stop it. They also need to verify the patient's medical history and what medications they may be taking to ensure nothing will interfere with the stroke treatment medication.

In Ted Ichton's case, doctors also had to perform a thrombectomy, or surgical procedure to remove blood clots from arteries in the brain, in addition to administering the tissue plasminogen activator medication. Because his specialized stroke team was able to move so quickly in treating him, Ted Itchon says most people he meets don't even know he suffered a stroke.

""I can't tell you how much I appreciate the doctors. They were fantastic, and I enjoyed them, even though I wanted to get out (of the hospital). I don't even know how to explain the gratitude I have,"" he said. ""If it wasn't for Ann and her diligence, her quickness of calling 911, I would probably be less than what I am now.""

Ted Itchon was able to return home just four days after his stroke. While he still required outpatient physical therapy sessions to help him recover some speech skills and treat his foot that was affected by the stroke, Johnson says Ted Itchon experienced a relatively speedy recovery thanks to the quick door-to-needle time he received.

Typically, a stroke occurs when a blood clot blocks an artery, preventing blood flow and oxygen delivery to the brain, which can result in the death of brain cells. Strokes are most common in older adults — especially those with high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes — but can happen to anyone, according to Johnson. As strokes are the fifth-leading cause of death in the U.S., he encourages people to be informed so they can help themselves or loved ones suffering from a stroke.

""We always like to remind people that we use the mnemonic device BEFAST to remind patients and the public what to look out for for a stroke: sudden severe balance problems, eye problems — so vision loss on one side or the other — facial droop, arm weakness, speech problems .. and then 'T' is time, so time to call 911 and time to come in and seek treatment,"" said Johnson.

After calling 911, Johnson says one of the best things a loved one can do to expedite the door-to-needle time for someone suffering from a stroke is to know what medications they take and be prepared to provide their medical history. Most stroke patients are unable to speak clearly or coherently, so having a family member or friend's number to contact for information can help first responders and hospital staff.

Finally, prevention can be the best medicine for some stroke patients, according to Johnson. While not all strokes are preventable, 80% are if patients receive treatment for conditions that make them higher risk for stroke, like high blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes and smoking.

A hidden condition suffered by one in four Americans may raise the risk of fast-rising cancer in young people, a study suggests.

Scientists have discovered a link between early-onset colon cancer and fatty liver disease, a condition where excessive fat accumulates in the liver.

Suffered by 80 to 100million Americans, the disease often develops silently, causing minimal or no symptoms - but it can lead to inflammation in the body linked to cancer.

The most common kind is caused by alcohol, though sugary diets, obesity and smoking can lead to non-alcoholic liver disease (NAFLD).

The team found people under 50 with a history of NAFLD were up to 24 percent more likely to develop colon cancer than people without the condition.

And people who showed early signs of the disease had a 12 percent greater risk than people with no history of liver disease.

The researchers suggested the inflammation caused by NAFLD may travel to the colon, damaging cell DNA and leading to the formation of cancer cells.

The team South Korea said that while more research is needed, early colon cancer screening should be adopted for people with NAFLD.

In the study of nearly 5million adults ages 20 to 49, men living with NAFLD were also 17 percent more likely than women to be struck by colorectal cancer.

The researchers tied this to men being more likely to smoke and be obese, risk factors for liver disease.

Writing in the study, they said: 'Our findings revealed a strong link between NAFLD and early-onset CRC in young adults, suggesting the importance of implementing effective preventive strategies, particularly in populations with a growing burden of metabolic dysfunction.'

The findings come as colorectal cancer surges in young Americans, with rates in under-50s increasing from 8.6 cases per 100,000 people to 13 cases per 100,000 people in the last two decades.

The study, published in the journal Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology, evaluated 4.6million adults in South Korea ages 20 to 49 from a South Korean insurance database.

Of those, 2,733 developed early-onset colorectal cancer after an average of nine years.

Each participant underwent routine health checks in 2009 and was followed until 2019.

All participants were grouped into four categories: NAFLD, borderline NAFLD or no NAFLD.

Fatty liver is diagnosed through a combination of physical exams, blood tests, and imaging studies, including ultrasound, CT scans, or MRIs.

About 11 percent were diagnosed with NAFLD, 19 percent were borderline and 70 percent had no history of the condition. Participants in the NAFLD group tended to be older and male, smokers and mild-to-moderate drinkers.

They also tended to have a higher BMI, waist circumference and blood pressure, all risk factors for liver disease.

After taking risk factors into account, patients with NAFLD had a 24 percent increased risk of developing early colon cancer, and those in the borderline NAFLD group had a 12 percent higher chance compared to people without the condition.

And of those with NAFLD, men were 17 percent more likely than women to develop colorectal cancer.

As well as men living generally unhealthier lives, the researchers suggested the gender divide could be because the female sex hormone estrogen has been shown to promote the growth of healthy bacteria in the gut and protect against inflammation.

Smoking, a risk factor for NAFLD, is also more common in men, and women are more likely to eat non-inflammatory fruits and vegetables.

NAFLD patients in their 20s were also 24 percent more likely to develop colon cancer than people in their 30s and 11 percent more likely than patients in their 40s.

The likelihood of developing colon cancer was also 18 percent greater for non-diabetics compared to people with diabetes, leading the experts to suggest NAFLD may be a better indicator of colon cancer risk than diabetes.

The researchers wrote: 'To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to provide clinical evidence supporting a correlation between NAFLD and early-onset CRC.'

The team suggested NAFLD and early-onset colorectal cancer could be connected through shared 'inflammatory pathways.'

Symptoms of fatty liver disease can be difficult to notice at first, other than fatigue. However, as the disease progresses, symptoms such as swelling, red palms, and jaundice appear

NAFLD creates inflammation that damages cell DNA and causes cells to rapidly replicate, increasing the risk of cancerous cells forming.

According to the researchers, chronic liver inflammation also releases cytokines - signaling proteins that communicate with the immune system - which promote the growth of cancer cells.

NAFLD also disrupts the function of bile acids, which leads to imbalances in the gut microbiome, a risk factor for colorectal cancer.

Additionally, NAFLD raised the risk of tumors specifically in the lower left side of the colon and the rectum, suggesting the condition targets lower areas of the colon and rectum, though the exact mechanism is unclear.

There were several limitations, including a lack of data on family history, colon cancer stage and colonoscopy history.

The researchers wrote: 'These findings highlight the need for multifaceted preventive strategies, including lifestyle interventions and expanded screening for younger populations with NAFLD.'"|"Scientists have discovered a link between early-onset colon cancer and fatty liver disease, a condition where excessive fat accumulates in the liver.

""Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.""



We're going to cut right to the chase: Logistically speaking, 10,000 steps a day equates to approximately five miles. But, there may be some variance in that based on your stride, says Natalya Vasquez, CPT, a certified personal trainer, health coach, and founder of Bridal Bootcamp San Diego.

Plus, how long it will take you to get in this many steps is also pretty individualized: “If you’re walking at a moderate pace of approximately 3.0 mph, or 20 minutes per mile, it would take approximately one hour and 40 minutes to walk five miles, but if you walk at a faster pace of 4.0 mph or approximately 15 minutes per mile, it would take approximately one hour and 15 minutes to walk five miles,” she explains.

Is 10,000 steps even a magic number or nah?

Short answer: Not really. But it takes some explaining. The recommendation originated from a Japanese company’s 1960s marketing campaign for their pedometer, says Vasquez. “The name of their pedometer translated into ‘10,000 steps,’ and at the time, there was no research to substantiate the claim that 10,000 steps was the gold-standard, but they simply set a higher bar for their population to encourage healthier behavior,” she says. (The translation was actually '10,000 step meter' and WH took a deep dive into the 10,000 steps myth if you're interested in joining us in this rabbit hole.)

What's absolutely not up for debate is that walking is great exercise for anyone with lower-body mobility since it’s low-impact and can be easily modified with speed and intensity, says Vasquez. (Also: It's very underrated as a form of weight loss, if that's your goal.) It can also increase muscle definition in your legs, she adds.

That said, if you’re fairly inactive and currently get something like 2,000 steps per day, immediately jumping to a number such as 10,000 can be unrealistic and even unsafe, so Vasquez recommends gradually adding steps so your muscles and joints have time to adjust.

So how much walking is truly enough per day?

There isn’t one universal answer on how many steps a day is “enough,” because it depends on your ability, current fitness level, and time constraints.

That said, the sweet spot for lowering the risk of disease and premature death is walking between 7,000 to 8,000 steps a day, and anything more than that may plateau benefits, according to a 2023 study out of the University of Granada.

Want more walking inspo? Join WH+ and you'll get the exclusive 4-week walking plan to burn fat and build muscle.

However, other factors like age, physical health, city’s walkability, or access to a treadmill also play a role in determining realistic goals, says Vasquez. “If you’re in a sedentary job and don’t move much throughout the day, you’ll want to gradually work on increasing your daily steps,” she explains. “A good goal would be to increase your steps by 2,000 to 3,000 from where you’re currently at, adjusting every couple of weeks, which will allow time for your body to adjust until you reach the 7,000 to 8,000 range or greater.”

Another pro tip? Break up your step goal throughout the day and go for small 15- to 20-minute walks when possible to make it less daunting, says Vasquez. Whether you pace while on a work call, walk your dog around the block, or park further away from the store, get creative with your steps.

If the results hold, the implications could be enormous — not just for Parkinson’s, but for other neurodegenerative diseases too. Huntington’s, ALS, even Alzheimer’s could be future targets for similar cell-replacement strategies.

Changes before and after the procedure. Image from the study.

Parkinson’s disease is a progressive brain disorder that affects movement, balance, and coordination. It begins subtly, often with tremors in one hand or a slight stiffness in the limbs. But over time, it chips away at a person’s ability to walk, speak, and live independently. It’s estimated that 10 million people live with Parkinson’s, and is prevalence is rising fast as populations age.

The culprit is the gradual loss of dopamine-producing neurons in a part of the brain called the substantia nigra. Without enough dopamine, the brain’s signals to the muscles falter. There’s currently no cure for Parkinson’s disease, just treatments to slow down progression and deal with some of the effects.

Scientists have had the idea to replace dead cells directly in the brain for decades. In the 1980s and ’90s, some researchers tried transplanting fetal brain tissue into patients, but the results were inconsistent. Some patients improved, others didn’t. Tumors and uncontrolled movements were common side effects. And the ethical concerns surrounding fetal tissue never went away.

This new study from Japan takes a new approach to this idea. Instead of fetal tissue, researchers used induced pluripotent stem (iPS) — adult cells that have been genetically reprogrammed to behave like embryonic stem cells. These versatile cells can be turned into nearly any cell type in the body. And that includes the dopamine-producing neurons that Parkinson’s destroys.

Promising, though not perfect

Seven patients were enrolled in the study. One dropped out before surgery due to a COVID-19 infection, and another received the transplant in two stages and was evaluated only for safety (not for drug efficacy).

None of the patients had any major side effects and four showed improvements in movement when off their usual medications. Their average motor scores improved by 20%, and brain scans confirmed that the implanted cells were producing dopamine. A fifth patient improved while on medication. One patient didn’t improve, but their symptoms didn’t worsen either.

The gains were modest but meaningful. One patient improved by two stages on the Hoehn–Yahr scale, a widely used measure of Parkinson’s severity. Another saw a 50% improvement in motor function during off-medication testing.

“It is a significant achievement that we have been able to confirm improvement in patients’ symptoms,” said Jun Takahashi, director of Kyoto University’s Center for iPS Cell Research and Application, who is leading the research. “We hope to deliver this treatment to patients as soon as possible.”

Dopamine is back, to an extent

Researchers carried out brain scans to see how much dopamine production increased. They used a specialized tracer and found that in the patients that received the highest dose, dopamine increased by an average of 63.5%; in the low-dose group, it rose by just 7%.

Notably, in three patients, dopamine activity increased only in specific parts of the brain — right where the cells were injected. That local boost was still enough to improve symptoms in some cases, but there was no generalized return of dopamine production.

Still, the study authors are confident.

This trial is the most advanced test yet of iPS-cell-derived neurons in human patients — and the results may open the door to regulatory approval. Sumitomo Pharma, the company which helped manufacture the cells, plans to seek approval to manufacture and sell the treatment in Japan by the end of fiscal 2025. If successful, it would become only the second approved iPS-cell-based regenerative medicine product in the country, after a treatment for heart disease.

The team’s goal is to develop a standardized, off-the-shelf cell therapy that can be administered to a wide population. The cells used in this study were derived from a donor whose genetic immune profile matches about 17% of the Japanese population, reducing the risk of rejection.

Japan has made regenerative medicine a priority. It was the first country to approve clinical use of iPS cells, and it continues to lead in funding and infrastructure for stem cell-based treatments. This trial may put Japan at the forefront of a new era in neuroscience.

These terrifying episodes cause hallucinations can blur the boundary between dream and reality, sometimes leaving patients confused, emotionally shaken for what can be years.

Some patients become convinced they were assaulted by their doctor.

Dr Gary Wenk, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Ohio State University, told DailyMail.com that doctors and patients should be more aware of the little-known side effect of anesthesia.

He adds: 'Although the reported incidence is apparently quite low, the experience may be under reported, especially by the female patients.'

The issue has been linked to the use of benzodiazepines, depressants that cause sedation and hypnosis, Propofol and ketamine, used to help patients relax or sleep before and during surgery, and nitric oxide, often administered during heart surgery to help relax blood vessels in the lungs.

The best analogy to explain this phenomenon Dr Wenk says, is dreaming. He explains that 'people tend to dream about things they desire or fear'.

However, 'research has shown that dreaming and anesthesia produce different types of brain activity patterns.'

A warning has been issued around popular drugs administered before surgery that can cause patients to suffer from disturbing and hyper realistic sexual fantasies

More than 40 million people undergo surgeries worldwide every year, so medical experts worry that this phenomenon could cause lasting psychological damage to patients and have professional repercussions for medical staff, if they are wrongly accused of assault.

Some studies even suggest that up to 18 percent of patients may have difficulty distinguishing between reality and fantasy during or after anesthesia.

The most common drug used for general anesthesia during surgery is Propofol, due to its rapid effect and good recovery profile, meaning that it leads to a faster return to normal consciousness.

Dr Wenk warns in a piece for Psychology Today: 'Health care professionals need to be aware of the potential risks to the patient and legal risks for themselves.'

Dr Wenk's concerns come off the back of research out of the University of Connecticut, which looked at 87 cases.

The study revealed that four in ten of the reported sexual fantasies were associated with benzodiazepines and 'dose played an important role'.

The sexual hallucinations only happened when the two benzodiazepines - midazolam and diazepam - were administered in doses that were 'rather high'.

Your browser does not support iframes.

In another case, 110 dental surgery patients reported episodes of sexual visions or sexual arousal after being administered a 'standard cocktail' of drugs which included fentanyl, diazepam, and methohexital.

Among the patients, Dr Wenk notes that the nature of the sexual episodes varied, with 60 percent reporting that their visions happened during their surgery, while 13.3 percent said they had sexual dreams after returning home.

Meanwhile, around 10 percent of patients said that experienced 'unpleasant sexual hallucinations' while in the recovery room.

The researchers noted that with many of the cases of this phenomenon happening, the 'places of the body where procedures were conducted coincided with the area of the body where the patients perceived the sexual assault or fantasy occurred'.

Some people reported that their sexual hallucinations took a dark turn and these unpleasant visions linked to sexual assault were most associated with the use of ketamine.

'One patient stated she would not undergo anesthesia again if ketamine was used,' Dr Wenk writes.

The majority of patients who reported disturbing sexual visions were women, Dr Wenk notes, while men had more agreeable hallucinations.

Discussing this finding further, he told this website: 'The males in the study often had positive sexual fantasies that occurred more often when their therapist was female.

'The females were more likely to experience hallucinations of sexual assault, especially if their therapist was a male (which was often the case).

'Statistically, by middle age, most females are victims of some sort of sexual assault. Indeed, that experience might be the reason they seek our medical treatment and then are given one of these sedative hypnotic drugs.'

Because of this difference between the sexes, the University of Connecticut researchers deduced that males complained about their drug-induced fantasies less often.

For instance, a high number of female patients - 12 percent out of 130 - undergoing anesthesia for procedures related to the reproductive system reported experiencing 'amorous or disinhibited behaviors while sedated'.

The researchers also found that the sex of the medical team also had an impact on patients having fantasies.

Dr Wenk notes that in one of the reports featuring 300 predominantly male patients who were admitted for urological procedures focused on the urinary tract and male reproductive system, 'none of them reported having a sexually related dream when the surgical team was all male'.

However, of 40 male patients who had female anesthesiologists, one of them reported having a dream about her during his procedure.

In his piece for Psychology Today, Dr Wenk warns that benzodiazepines and propofol were not the only drugs that produced sexual fantasies.

He concludes: 'Dopamine agonists, such as ADHD medications and stimulants, dopamine antagonists, such as antipsychotics, and some antidepressants have also produced sexual fantasies in some patients.

'Dopamine-enhancing anti-Parkinson medications have been known to have a libido-stimulating effect in males.'

Meanwhile, the researchers of the original study signed off with a caution.

They wrote: 'While sexual assault hallucinations or fantasies associated with sedative hypnotics are rare, it is imperative that health care providers take the necessary precautions and follow recommendations to provide safety for themselves and their patients.'

Dr Wenk told this website that the current recommendation is for doctors to warn the patient that such an experience could happen.

However, he notes that 'the risk for both patient and therapist is that by warning that a hallucination could occur it might make it more likely for the patient to experience one.

'Sort of a self-fulfilling prophecy due to the power of suggestion. Each therapist will have to decide which approach is best for their patient.'"|"Popular drugs administered before surgery can cause patients to suffer from disturbing and hyper realistic sexual fantasies, doctors warn.

Only about 100 proteins showed sex-specific genetic regulation, suggesting that environmental, hormonal, and lifestyle factors play a major role in shaping health outcomes.

The results of an international study led by researchers from Queen Mary University of London’s Precision Healthcare University Research Institute (PHURI) shed new light the underlying biological mechanisms which cause differences in health risks, symptoms and outcomes between males and females.

The study, carried out in collaboration with the Berlin Institute of Health at Charité, Universitätsmedizin Berlin, and the Medical Research Council (MRC) Epidemiology Unit at the University of Cambridge, was published today in Nature Communications.

Using data from UK Biobank and the Fenland study, the team carried an in-depth analysis of the genetic links between ~6,000 proteins and hundreds of diseases in 56,000 males and females.

The team found that for two-thirds of these proteins, their levels differed between males and females. Further examination revealed that only a very small fraction, around 100 proteins out of the 6,000 studied, had differences in the genetic ‘switches’ which control their levels, when compared between males and females.

These findings, which may have implications for drug development, indicate that while there are differences between the sexes in relation to how much they express certain proteins, what’s causing these differences isn’t solely down to differences in their genetics.

Instead, the authors highlight the importance of looking beyond genetics – and other medical factors such as hormones – when comparing health risks and outcomes between males and females.

Their findings indicate that non-medical factors such as where people work and live, their education, financial situation, access to resources, as well as their lifestyle also contribute to the health differences experiences between the sexes and so should be explored further and considered more when exploring sex differences in health.

Mine Koprulu, lead author of the study and a postdoctoral researcher at Queen Mary’s PHURI, said: “For the first time in history, we are able to study human biology at this level of detail—across genes, proteins, and more. This is the largest study to date exploring the similarities and differences in how our genetic code regulates blood protein levels between sexes.

“Our findings highlight the need to better understand the factors that impact health differences — at the genetic level and beyond— to create more tailored and equitable healthcare for everyone.”

Professor Claudia Langenberg, Director of the PHURI at Queen Mary and Professor of Computational Medicine at the Berlin Institute of Health at Charité, Germany, said: “Drug development pipelines increasingly incorporate information on genetic differences in protein levels and function and this has led to large investment in human cohorts, such as UK Biobank.

“From this perspective, better understanding of population differences in the regulation of proteins, such as those between males and females, is essential to guide precision medicine approaches and identify where one size may not fit all.

“Our results clearly show that with very few exceptions, protein regulating genetic variants identified so far behave in a very similar way in males and females. This provides evidence for an important implicit assumption – that insights arising from studying these variants apply to both sexes.”

In this study, data was categorised as male or female based on chromosomal information (XX or XY). The authors acknowledge that chromosomal information does not always align with an individual’s gender identity.

However, for the purposes of this study (genetic and protein-level scientific analyses), this categorisation was necessary, and data on gender identity was not reliably recoded meaning it could not be consistently used across all data.

“Sex differences in the genetic regulation of the human plasma proteome” by Mine Koprulu et al. Nature Communications

Abstract

Sex differences in the genetic regulation of the human plasma proteome

Mechanisms underlying sex differences in the development and prognosis of many diseases remain largely elusive.

Here, we systematically investigated sex differences in the genetic regulation of plasma proteome (>5800 protein targets) across two cohorts (30,307 females; 26,058 males).

Plasma levels of two-thirds of protein targets differ significantly by sex. In contrast, genetic effects on protein targets are remarkably similar across sexes, with only 103 sex-differential protein quantitative loci (sd-pQTLs; for 2.9% and 0.3% of protein targets from antibody- and aptamer-based platforms, respectively).

A third of those show evidence of sexual discordance, i.e., effects observed in one sex only (n = 30) or opposite effect directions (n = 1 for CDH15).

Phenome-wide analyses of 365 outcomes in UK Biobank did not provide evidence that the identified sd-pQTLs accounted for sex-differential disease risk.

Our results demonstrate similarities in the genetic regulation of protein levels by sex with important implications for genetically-guided drug target discovery and validation."|"These findings challenge the assumption that genetic differences alone explain sex-based health disparities.

323|https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2025/05/12/ai-tool-biological-age-faceage/|New AI tool predicts your biological age from a selfie|2025-05-12 00:00:00|"Our faces suggest our true age and even how much time we may have left on Earth. While doctors learn to form a picture of a patient’s health from their face, using what they call “the eyeball test,” new research in the Lancet Digital Health indicates that this may be a job that artificial intelligence can enhance in the future.

Scientists at Mass General Brigham in Boston have developed and carried out some initial testing of an AI tool called FaceAge, an algorithm designed to tell patients’ biological age from a photograph as simple as a selfie ― not how old they are in years, but how old they are in health.

Biological age is considered crucial in helping doctors determine the most appropriate therapy, such as whether a cancer patient is healthy enough to tolerate an aggressive treatment. FaceAge requires more testing before doctors can begin using it routinely, but scientists said that in the next week or two, they expect to begin enrolling about 50 patients in a pilot study.

Researchers said they trained FaceAge using about 59,000 photographs of people ages 60 and older who were presumed to be healthy. Most of the photos were publicly available on Wikipedia and the internet movie database IMDb, while some came from UTKFace, a large-scale dataset with pictures of people from less than a year old to 116 years old.

The developers of FaceAge tested it on a group of 6,200 cancer patients, using photographs taken at the start of radiotherapy treatment. The algorithm determined that when it came to their health, cancer patients were, on average, about five years older than their chronological age. Moreover, the tool found that the older their faces looked, the worse their survival outlook.

Scientists then conducted an experiment in which they asked eight doctors to determine whether terminal cancer patients would be alive in six months based first on the patient’s photograph alone, then on the photograph and clinical information, and finally based on FaceAge and clinical information.

“We found that doctors on average can predict life expectancy with an accuracy that’s only a little better than a coin flip,” when using a photo alone for their analysis, said Raymond Mak, a radiation oncologist at Mass General Brigham and one of the lead investigators for the study.

When using a photo alone, the doctors were right about 61 percent of the time. Given photos and clinical information on the patients, they were right about 74 percent of the time. Provided with FaceAge and medical chart information, the doctors’ accuracy reached 80 percent.

In a news conference last week, Mak said he tested FaceAge using the photograph of a patient whom he first met four years ago, an 86-year-old man with terminal lung cancer.

“Some doctors would hesitate to offer cancer treatment to someone in their late 80s or 90s with the rationale that the patient may die of other causes before the cancer progresses and becomes life-threatening,” Mak said. “But he looked younger than 86 to me, and based on the eyeball test and a host of other factors, I decided to treat him with aggressive radiation therapy.”

Several years later, when Mak ran the man’s photograph through FaceAge, “we found he’s more than 10 years younger than his chronological age.” The patient is now 90, “and still doing great,” Mak said.

Researchers stressed that FaceAge is not intended to replace a doctor’s assessment, but rather to provide an objective measure to help fill out a clinical picture.

“I think it’s really important to know that different people age at different rates, and, as they’re showing here, that clearly seems to have a major effect on their actual prognosis,” said Gary Schwartz, a scientist at University Health Network’s Princess Margaret Cancer Center in Toronto, who was not involved in the research.

Having a face with a lot of mileage on it, however, does not necessarily doom someone to an early grave.

In a second demonstration of FaceAge, the developers had it analyze photographs of actors Paul Rudd and Wilford Brimley when each man was 50. The algorithm determined that Rudd’s biological age was about 43; Brimley’s was almost 69 (though he would live to 85).

Irbaz Riaz, an assistant professor of medicine and senior associate consultant in the department of AI and informatics at Mayo Clinic, called FaceAge “a promising early-stage tool.”

While the tool does not replace a doctor’s experience, said Riaz, who did not work on the study, “it could standardize the subtle visual assessments we make every day. That said, clinicians will need to understand how the model was trained, when it might be biased and where it could add value without overstepping its role.”

Nasim Eftekhari, vice president of applied AI and advanced analytics at City of Hope cancer treatment and research center in Duarte, California, who did not participate in the study, called the tool “an incremental improvement,” saying, “if this goes through validation and bias testing and approvals, and all of that, this could be an additional biomarker, at best,” to go with cancer stage, characteristics of the tumor and other factors.

Developers of FaceAge acknowledged that should the technology be approved by the Food and Drug Administration, ethical guidelines will need to be established to govern its use and access to its information.

“This technology can do a lot of good, but it could also potentially do some harm,” said Hugo Aerts, director of the Artificial Intelligence in Medicine program at Mass General Brigham and another lead investigator on the FaceAge study.

Aerts said hospitals have “very strong governance committees and regulatory guidelines that they have to adhere to [to] make sure these AI technologies are being used in the right way, really only for the benefit of the patients” and not for others, such as insurers.

Privacy has been a key concern for earlier technologies that attempt to show how we might use age based on a photo, such as FaceApp.

Although initial testing of FaceAge focused on cancer patients, the scientists plan also to measure its performance for other conditions.

Aerts said that the tool still needs to be trained to deal with numerous variables that can affect a photograph of a face: lighting, makeup, skin tone and, of course, our attempts to look younger through plastic surgery.

“So this is something that we are actively investigating and researching,” Aerts said. “We’re now testing in various datasets [to see] how we can make the algorithm robust against this.”

While the tool still has much to learn, we may have something to learn from it, too.

“It is important to know that the algorithm looks at age differently than humans do,” Aerts said. “So, for example, being bald or not, or being gray is less important in the algorithm than we actually initially thought.”"|"Researchers said they trained FaceAge using about 59,000 photographs of people ages 60 and older who were presumed to be healthy.

Become an Insider and start reading now.

Colon cancer is rising in people under 50. James Kinross, a gastrointestinal surgeon who researches how the gut microbiome affects our risk of the disease, told Business Insider that poor gut health could be partly to blame.

Research suggests the gut microbiome, the trillions of microbes that live in the digestive tract, has a wide-ranging effect on our health. But our sterile, urbanized lifestyles, appear to have made them less diverse overall and, therefore, weaker, according to Kinross, who is based at Imperial College London.

""You're seeing a generational loss in our internal ecology, which is being hammered with a series of environmental hits that it simply cannot adapt to,"" he said, referring to factors including microplastics, ultra-processed foods, and minimal access to nature. Many studies have linked these changes in the gut microbiome to an increase in colon cancer risk.

But, the gut microbiome is changeable, meaning there are things we can do to increase its diversity, which in turn could help lower colon cancer risk. ""It is an ecosystem which you can adapt, and you can modify,"" he said.

Kinross previously shared with BI how he eats to boost his gut microbiome. He shared the three things he does aside from healthy eating to lower his colon cancer risk.

Don't take antibiotics if you don't need to

As a surgeon, Kinross is acutely aware that antibiotics are often necessary and save millions of lives each year, but he believes we use them too liberally — particularly to treat viral infections they can't tackle.

""In my house, to qualify for antibiotics, you've really got to have a pathogen that you need treated,"" Kinross said.

Kinross and his family limit their use of antibiotics as much as possible because taking them can disrupt the ecosystem of the gut microbiome, killing off good bacteria along with pathogens, and reducing diversity.

He likened it to pouring weed killer all over your garden. ""Your garden won't really grow into a lovely garden full of wild meadows and flowers and color. It will just be brown and lifeless,"" he said.

Take vitamin D

Kinross takes a vitamin D supplement because evidence suggests that having enough of the nutrient is important for gut health.

Vitamin D is crucial for several biological processes, including calcium absorption and cellular repair — but also keeps the lining of the small intestine strong. If the lining becomes weak, microbes can pass through it into the bloodstream and cause inflammation. Chronic inflammation is linked to a higher risk of chronic diseases, including cancer.

Vitamin D is found in foods including oily fish, egg yolks, and red meat, as well as from sunlight. In countries with climates like the UK's, where Kinross lives, it can be difficult to get enough vitamin D in the colder months, and residents are advised to supplement from October to March.

Socialize

Social connections are a pillar of health. pixdeluxe/Getty Images

Kinross goes cycling with friends regularly and makes sure to sit down to eat dinner with his family in the evenings. As well as being a pillar of overall health, research suggests that socializing positively impacts the composition of our gut microbiomes, Kinross said.

We exchange microbes through physical touch, and studies have found that friends, family members, and spouses have similar gut microbes to one another.

A 2024 study published in the journal Nature, based on 1,787 adults from 18 isolated villages in Honduras, found that people in the same social network shared more similarities in their gut microbiomes compared to those outside of it. This was regardless of diet, water sources, and medications. Spouses and people living together had the highest amount of microbial sharing, but the phenomenon still occurred among friends and even friends of friends.

""Our social interactions, our real-world social interactions, define so much of our health,"" Kinross said. ""It's good for all aspects of our health. It's good for our mental health, it's good for our cardiovascular health. It's good for everything. But if you're not having real-world social interaction, you are not really optimizing your gut health, I believe."""|"Many studies have linked these changes in the gut microbiome to an increase in colon cancer risk.

A drug to treat migraine, ubrogepant, is also found to reduce common non-headache symptoms that occur in the hours preceding a migraine headache, according to the results of a large phase three clinical trial published in Nature Medicine. The findings suggest that ubrogepant may be the first acute treatment for the symptoms that occur before migraine, which have a considerable impact on daily function.

Several symptoms can occur before a migraine headache, including aura and premonitory (prodromal) symptoms—also known as early-onset symptoms—such as sensitivity to light and sound, nausea, neck pain and dizziness.

Although most migraine research has focused on treating headaches, no treatments have shown efficacy in alleviating early premonitory symptoms that often last for hours and can cause considerable dysfunction for people with migraine. Ubrogepant is a drug that blocks the CGRP receptor on neurons, which are responsible for the transmission of pain, but its potential ability to treat premonitory symptoms of migraine had been unclear.

Peter Goadsby and colleagues analyzed the effectiveness of ubrogepant as a treatment for premonitory symptoms in 438 participants 18–75 years of age with at least a one-year history of migraine.

Participants were split into two groups for a double-blind study, and took a 100-milligram dose of either ubrogepant or a placebo once initial premonitory symptoms started, during which the participant was confident a headache would follow within one to six hours. During a second prodromal event at least seven days later, participants took the opposite treatment (ubrogepant or placebo).

Goadsby and colleagues found that when participants received ubrogepant, they self-reported improvements in their ability to concentrate one hour after treatment, reduced sensitivity to light two hours after treatment, and reduced fatigue and neck pain after three hours, compared with the placebo-treated group. Dizziness and sensitivity to sound symptoms were also reduced in ubrogepant-treated participants between four and 24 hours after treatment.

These findings suggest that ubrogepant may be an effective treatment for common premonitory symptoms, with improvements beginning possibly as early as one hour after dosing. However, additional studies specifically designed to evaluate the effect of acute treatment on prodromal symptoms are needed.

But just a year later, the 39-year-old from Franklin, New York, suddenly couldn't breathe and felt like she was suffocating.

She was rushed to the hospital — where doctors made a devastating diagnosis and said she could die at any moment.

Physicians said vaping had severely damaged her lungs, causing inflammation and fluid buildup that made it harder to breathe.

Her collapsed lung could no longer expand and contract properly, and even slight movements risked rupturing more fragile air sacs.

Her doctors warned her lungs were like a 'ticking time bomb'.

She had to stop vaping immediately and could no longer lie flat — not even to sleep. Instead, she was forced to sleep upright in a recliner.

Lying down, they cautioned, could trigger more ruptures and internal bleeding that might flood her lungs with fluid — ultimately suffocating her.

Loyda Cordero Galiero, 39, was left fighting for her life after she switched from smoking to vaping, believing she had made a healthy choice

She also could not do any exercise in case the strain burst the air-sacs, even something as simple as cooking or carrying groceries.

The lungs are made up of tiny balloon-like structures called alveoli, or air sacs, which are responsible for exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide.

When these sacs are damaged or burst — as can happen with severe inflammation or pressure changes — it can lead to bleeding, fluid buildup, and a dangerous loss of lung function.

Galiero said she was a pack-a-day smoker before switching to vaping. But once she started using e-cigarettes, she would puff 'like crazy'.

She said: 'With a cigarette, you can put it out and do what you've got to do.

'But with a vape it's like a cell phone — it's literally stuck in your hand 24/7 and you're hitting it even when you don't want to hit it just because it's there.'

She added: 'It's horrible. Vaping is 100 percent more dangerous than cigarettes.'

Doctors say vaping can be healthier than smoking because it doesn't involve burning tobacco, which is what produces the most harmful chemicals in cigarette smoke.

But physicians also say that using vapes regularly — particularly those not approved by the FDA — can cause complications.

Smoke from the devices contains propylene glycol — made from petroleum — that can inflame the airways, leading blood to leak into the lungs.

Galiero didn't say what brand she was using, or what flavors — but many are attracted to vapes for their appealing and often fruity tastes.

She added that she was 'so proud' when she had made the switch from smoking to vaping, and was never once warned about the potential risks.

After she was rushed to the ER in March this year, when she choked on a sip of a drink, doctors diagnosed her with pulmonary bullae — or when large air-filled spaces open up in the lungs when lung tissue is destroyed.

She was told she would need to quit vaping before having surgery, which would likely involve removing fluid-filled areas of her lungs.

Galiero, from New York state, is pictured above in her hospital bed after doctors said that vaping had put her life at risk

After quitting, she underwent surgery on April 30 — and is still there now recovering from the procedure.

Galiero said: 'My doctor said that my lung collapsed because they were building up with the liquid from my vape and one of the pulmonary bullae ended up rupturing.'

She added: 'My esophagus is out of place to where the pulmonary bullae sac is putting pressure onto that and if that ruptures, it could cause... internal bleeding which could kill me instantly.'

Speaking before the surgery, she added: 'It's causing a lot of problems.

'If I lay down when sleeping instead of sitting up I can choke to death on my own spit or I can suffocate and die.

'I literally have to sit up in bed or on a recliner when I sleep because I'm no longer allowed to sleep lying down until after the surgery — it's pretty much a life or death situation.'

Doctors say that it is healthier not to use cigarettes or vapes than to use either of the devices.

They warn that many vapes sold in the US are not FDA-approved, and have been shipped into the US from other countries — often China.

The mother-of-two underwent grueling surgery to repair her lungs, and is now recovering from it in the hospital

Vaping was initially approved in the US as a method to help people quit smoking, with some experts saying it was '95 percent less dangerous'.

But this is dependent on how often people use the devices, with many reporting that they puff on them far more than they ever smoked cigarettes.

About 6.5 percent of US adults vape, according to the CDC, equivalent to about 16.7million people in the country.

It isn't clear how many are sickened by the devices every year, but the CDC reports that between 2019 and 2020 there were 2,800 hospitalizations and 68 deaths due to lung damage from the devices. Numbers now are likely much higher.

The FDA has authorized 34 tobacco- and menthol-flavored e-cigarette devices to date, which underwent rigorous scientific review. It has not approved any vapes with fruity flavors."|"She was rushed to the hospital — where doctors made a devastating diagnosis and said she could die at any moment.

Dear Prudence,

Our daughter-in-law, “Alyssa,” has been a widow for four years. I adore her; she and our son, “Brian,” were so in love. But I don’t know how to bring up an awkward topic: dating again. Brian was diagnosed with aggressive leukemia at 27 and never got to turn 28. They’d always wanted kids, especially Allie. Sadly, Allie had a late miscarriage after his diagnosis. It was a horrible time for everyone, but Allie was consumed by the combined grief. We invited her to stay with us after his death because we loved her, and I was frankly worried about her well-being. She was working and seeing friends, but it was like she was sleepwalking through it all, and her physical health was visibly bad.

Alyssa slowly recovered and took the initiative to move into her own place two years ago. She seems well, and we still see her often, but she doesn’t seem to be dating, even casually. Last year, I gently suggested getting out there, and she sharply told me it was way too soon. But if she wants a baby, the time window to meet someone isn’t that long. I want her to have the family she talks about, and I know her own dad is pushing the “too soon” narrative at her. Her parents were worse than useless in her early widowhood: They got a divorce a few weeks before Brian’s death and then tried to get family to pick sides after his funeral. How can I gently suggest she consider dating anyway?

—Trying to Be Tactful

Dear Trying to Be Tactful,

I can tell how much you care about Alyssa and sincerely want the best for her. I think it’s great that you’ve continued to nurture your relationship and want her to find love, even though I imagine seeing her with a new partner might bring up some complicated feelings about Brian. She’s lucky to have you in her life, cheering for her to rebuild and find happiness.

But you need to take a big step back. When it comes to shaping Alyssa’s future, your role is to be a loving mother-in-law who can connect with her about a major source of grief. That’s it. You shouldn’t be a matchmaker or a fertility awareness counselor. And you definitely, definitely want to avoid becoming a source of stress and anxiety.

Also, believe me, there is no way this woman is unaware of the typical age range in which people have biological children. She has friends and internet access. She knows. She may very well miss the window for that specific kind of motherhood, because she’s just not ready to get back out there and find a partner in time. If that happens, it won’t be a tragedy. In fact, it will actually be much better than forcing herself to date while she’s still in mourning, having a child, and then experiencing yet another devastating loss when the relationship doesn’t work out because she wasn’t over your son.

Dear Prudence,

I have been divorced for three years, and I have a 10-year-old and 7-year-old. My ex and I share equal custody, and I never thought she would play games like this using our kids. I have only been dating casually until I met “Emily.” We are talking about marriage, and after I informed my ex, she changed.

Now she can’t bear not hearing from our kids every single night I have them. She has to video chat with them for up to an hour every night and uses guilt tactics against our kids. I essentially feel like she has invaded my home, especially with Emily over. We have no privacy, and my ex tells the kids to show her the house when she calls. It is the same one I have owned since the divorce. If I take away their devices and tell my kids they will see their mom in a few days, they get hysterical. My 7-year-old has more meltdowns than they did as a toddler. This has only started since I told my ex about Emily, so it is obvious that she feels threatened and needs to get her claws in. We already had a big issue with her trying to change the custody drop-off from my work to my home, despite it being far away from her own (my work is equally distant from both houses). My ex denies everything, and I can’t afford to take her back to court. I love Emily and my kids. I am ready to start a new chapter in our lives. Emily and the kids got along great until now. I don’t want this issue to screw that up. Help!

—Too Many Calls

Dear Too Many Calls,

This is tough because while you know your ex is using the nightly calls to insert herself into your new life, to put an end to them would upset and maybe even hurt your kids. You could end up—fairly or not—looking like the bad guy. In conflicts like this one, between divorced parents, I always think it’s important to keep your eye on the prize: your children’s well-being, and how you’ll look when they think back on the situation when they’re 30. The goal is for their therapists to one day say, “It sounds like your dad was a really safe person for you and put your needs first.” Sometimes, that means letting your ex win, at least temporarily.

But I also understand how unsettled you are by her thinly-veiled protest against the new relationship. So you should beat her at her own game. Everyone can gather around the iPad and call her together—yes, Emily too! You could start suggesting virtual game nights and remote dance parties. You might even volunteer to initiate the calls: “Hey, Em and the kids and I are making pancakes. Would you like me to FaceTime so you can see the process?” Your kids will get the contact they want with their mom and the very important feeling that the adults in their lives are kind to each other. You’ll totally avoid being the villain. You’ll take the mystery out of Emily’s presence. And eventually, I guarantee, your ex will get bored or see that she’s not getting under your skin the way she hoped she would, and her FaceTime fixation will slowly fade out.

Indulging in a delicious food item daily could potentially reduce your risk of a severe health condition by up to 28 per cent, research suggests. A study has indicated that a particular fruit could significantly decrease your likelihood of developing dementia.

Dementia is a syndrome characterised by a continuous decline in brain function. Symptoms can range from memory loss and behavioural changes to mobility issues.

While certain factors increasing the risk of dementia are beyond our control, such as genetics, age, and injury, others can be mitigated through lifestyle changes. Research indicates that approximately 45 per cent of dementia cases could be prevented with specific alterations.

Scientists also propose that our diet influences our risk of dementia. A study published in JAMA Network Open revealed that consuming one serving of berries daily could reduce your dementia risk by up to 28 per cent.

This is believed to be due to a chemical called flavonoids present in berries. These flavonoids are responsible for the vibrant colour of the fruit.

Flavonoids can also be found in other colourful foods like peppers, oranges, grapes, and even red wine. For this study, researchers tracked over 121,000 individuals without dementia (aged between 40 and 70) in the UK for about nine years.

The researchers examined their health and dietary data, including the daily consumption of various flavonoid-rich foods and beverages such as black or green tea, apples, berries, grapes, oranges, onions, peppers, dark chocolate, and red wine.

Harvard Health experts in the US, commenting on the study, stated: ""People who ate the most flavonoid-rich foods - six servings per day - had a 28 per cent lower risk of developing dementia during the study period, compared to those who ate the least. The link was especially strong among people with high blood pressure, depression, or a high genetic risk for dementia, as well as people who consumed at least two of the following each day: half a serving of berries, five cups of tea, or a glass of red wine.""

The authors of the study remarked: ""The findings from this large prospective cohort study of more than 120 000 UK Biobank participants suggest that consuming six additional servings per day of flavonoid-rich foods, specifically tea, red wine, and berries, was associated with a lower risk of dementia, with the strongest associations observed for tea. We were also able to show, for the first time in our knowledge, that these associations were evident in participants at high genetic risk of dementia and those with modifiable risk factors, including depression and hypertension, but not in those without.""

What does other research say?

Berries have once again been linked to a potential reduction in dementia risk. A 2021 study published in the Neurology journal underscored the positive impact of flavonoids on cognitive health.

The research was spearheaded by experts from Harvard Medical School who shared findings on their website stating: ""After accounting for factors that could have affected cognition (such as age, weight, physical activity, alcohol intake, depression, and intake of nutrients other than flavonoids), scientists found that people with the highest daily flavonoid intakes were 19 per cent less likely to report trouble with memory and thinking, compared with people who had the lowest daily flavonoid intakes.""

The study identified specific fruits and vegetables, such as strawberries, blueberries, peppers, celery, apples, bananas, oranges, and grapefruit, as being particularly associated with cognitive benefits. Although the study was observational and cannot conclusively prove that high flavonoid intake maintains mental sharpness in older age, smaller studies have observed similar links.

Researchers recommend aiming for a ""goal"" of consuming five portions of fruits and vegetables each day and suggest eating ""a rainbow"" to ensure a diet rich in variety for optimal brain and overall health.

Dementia symptoms

The NHS outlines that dementia can manifest differently across individuals, with everyone experiencing symptoms in their own way. However, there are some common early signs that might emerge well before a formal diagnosis of dementia is made.

The symptoms encompass:

Memory loss

Difficulty concentrating

Challenges in performing familiar daily tasks, such as confusion over the correct change when shopping

Struggles to follow a conversation or find the right word

Confusion about time and place

Mood changes.

These symptoms often start off mild and progressively worsen over time. If you or someone you know is exhibiting signs of dementia, it's important to consult with a doctor."|"More infoIndulging in a delicious food item daily could potentially reduce your risk of a severe health condition by up to 28 per cent, research suggests.

He stepped out into his backyard atop the Pacific Palisades in early January to find a raging fire leaping from three houses away to two. He gathered his family, helped older neighbors to their cars and fled without a single keepsake.

In the days that followed, Dr. Elsayegh, a pulmonologist, did not have a chance to grieve. As he did his rounds with patients at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif., his cellphone was bombarded with neighbors and friends seeking his expert advice.

What kind of air purifier?

Is an N-95 mask enough?

My daughter has asthma — should we rent a place farther away?

“Forty phone calls a day with the same set of questions,” Dr. Elsayegh recalled.

So when the chief administrative officer of the hospital invited him into his office to ask Dr. Elsayegh how he could support him and his family, Dr. Elsayegh replied instead, “Let’s open a clinic.”

Just three weeks after the blaze tore through neighborhoods of Los Angeles, the hospital’s urban fire clinic for pulmonary issues began seeing patients. They came in droves, each with a different set of symptoms and concerns. The clinic has served as an early indicator of the types of health problems developing among those exposed to the fires, ranging from newfound shortness of breath in healthy people to exacerbated symptoms in patients with asthma, C.O.P.D. and other lung diseases.

The health effects of an urban fire differ from a those of a wildfire, and when an entire community burns quickly, releasing unquantifiable toxins in unexpected directions for an unknowable period of time, there are long-term health effects that no expert can yet fully calculate. Dr. Elsayegh is making it his mission to support patients from the Palisades and surrounding communities for months and years into the future, when, he fears, cleanup crew members and others with chronic exposure may begin to show signs of severe lung diseases, like asbestosis and silicosis, and even cancers like mesothelioma."|"He stepped out into his backyard atop the Pacific Palisades in early January to find a raging fire leaping from three houses away to two.

A new theory suggests that we don't just listen to it; our bodies physically resonate with music, as our brains' natural oscillations synchronize with structures like rhythm and pitch.

Music is often thought of as a 'universal language' – people across cultures will bust out similar moves, and young kids will instinctively bop to a beat.

According to neural resonance theory, it's not just that we learn to expect and predict what's coming; aspects like harmony in the music we make and enjoy sound so good to us because they're in sync with the brain's resonant patterns.

""This theory suggests that music is powerful not just because we hear it, but because our brains and bodies become it,"" says Caroline Palmer, neuroscientist at McGill University in Canada. ""That has big implications for therapy, education, and technology.""

It's not a coincidence, of course. As humans messed around with music over millennia, we figured out what sounds best without necessarily understanding why.

Neural resonance theory (NRT) has now been formally described by Palmer and co-authors in a perspective paper reviewing the literature on musical neuroscience.

One of the key suggestions of NRT is that neural oscillations synchronize with external audio at different rates. On the slower end of the timescale is what we call rhythm, with distinct beats you can dance or bang a drum to. Neurons in the cortex oscillate at frequencies that resonate with those pulses in the music.

Higher frequencies, from about 30 to over 4,000 Hertz, are perceived as pitch. Gamma-frequency oscillations in the cortex sync up with the lower end of that, while the auditory nerve, brain stem, and cochlea resonate at the higher pitches.

This all comes together to make music pleasurable regardless of musical background – from young children to classically trained pros.

""Statistically universal structures may have arisen in music because they correspond to stable states of complex, pattern-forming dynamical systems,"" the authors explain.

That's not to say that there's no learned factor to appreciating music; the team says that aspects like pulse and more complex structures like meter can vary widely based on culture.

Simple pulses, like one you might clap to or bounce a baby on your knee to, develop more quickly and become stronger over time, but more complex structures are culture-specific. Over time, the brain oscillations showed bias towards those learned structures, called attunement.

Other aspects covered by NRT include groove, which is basically the urge to move your body to music. When a beat doesn't follow a predictable pulse but falls between pulses to a degree, the brain has to fill in the blanks – which the team calls nonlinear resonance.

""High groove ratings"" required just the right amount of this nonlinear resonance. Of course, music that's too disjointed isn't groovy enough to dance to either. Understandably, pop music tends to fall right in the middle of that range.

The paper also explores how NRT explains various other aspects of music, and what we can learn by applying it to this universal joy.

""NRT can provide insights into both neuroscience and human behavior, as well as the link between the two,"" the researchers write.

""Such insights can shed light on the interconnectedness of brain and body, the ability of music to communicate affect and emotion, the role of music in interpersonal bonding, and applications of music to brain health.""

The perspective was published in the journal Nature Reviews Neuroscience."|"A new theory suggests that we don't just listen to it; our bodies physically resonate with music, as our brains' natural oscillations synchronize with structures like rhythm and pitch.

You can reach Sarah on Signal at sarahlizchar.47.

The energy drink cans are the colors of a tropical beach sunset — aqua and tangerine and neon pink — so they really pop when lined up for fridge organizing shots on TikTok. They’re sugar-free but come in summery dessert flavors like Sherbet Swirl. On social media, the drinks are brandished by members of an official collegiate ambassadors program, gymnasts and cheerleaders whose dewy complexions suggest they’ve never had a hangover or slept through their alarm after a late-night study session.

Alani Nu, which was founded in 2018 by fitness influencer and coach Katy Hearn and acquired by competitor Celsius for $1.8 billion this spring, has styled itself as the nectar that fuels today’s effortlessly high-achieving, hummingbird-like young woman. (You can imagine Margot Robbie cracking open a can in the “Barbie” movie, just before her character experiences an existential breakdown.) Its success shows how the $22 billion energy drink industry, long dominated by labels like Monster and Red Bull that use extreme sports swagger to appeal to young men, is tapping into the aesthetics of health and wellness to reach new demographics and continue its exponential growth.

Many of the newer breeds tout “better for you ingredients” and benefits, from biotin (“oh, that hair skin + nails,” promises the copy on Gorgie) to lion’s mane mushrooms (“boosts memory, focus, and mental clarity,” declares the vaguely intellectual Odyssey). One hedge fund recently said it was betting against the $55 billion Monster empire, predicting it would be edged out by brands that appear more health-conscious.

The problem, health experts say, is the new wellness-themed marketing may be worsening consumer confusion over the risks of energy drinks. Many energy drinks contain supercharged doses of caffeine that are particularly risky for children, teenagers, people who are pregnant or breastfeeding, and people with underlying heart conditions. More surprising may be their potential dangers when working out, particularly since energy drinks are often promoted by fitness influencers and athletes. Researchers also worry the health risks may be compounded when combined with other common energy-drink ingredients like the amino acid taurine and guarana, a plant seed that contains caffeine.

“We’re seeing kids who show up with tachycardia,” or rapid heartbeat, said Mark Corkins, the division chief of pediatric gastroenterology at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center. “Some of them have chest pain and you find out they drink three or four energy drinks a day.”

advertisement

It’s not just adolescents, Corkins said, but preteens too. He tells parents and kids the same thing: Energy drinks are not benign, nor are they a substitute for sleep.

“People just don’t have any idea of what they’re getting,” said Victoria Vetter, a pediatric cardiologist at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia who co-authored a recent commentary on energy drinks’ risks to young people. She recalls evaluating a 7-year-old patient for an abnormal heart rhythm and asking if he drank any caffeine. Sure enough, his parents had bought him YouTube influencer Logan Paul’s Prime Energy, which contains 200 milligrams of caffeine, after he saw a video game influencer drinking it and asked for one. (The brand also has a caffeine-free drink, Prime Hydration, with similar packaging, albeit in a bottle rather than a can — which critics say creates more potential confusion.)

The American Beverage Association, which represents 94% of the U.S. energy drink market, said in a statement that for more than a decade, its members “have gone beyond all federal requirements when it comes to responsible labeling and marketing practices by displaying total caffeine content from all sources on labels and adhering to a long-standing commitment to not market to children.”

Related Story How ultra-processed foods captured the baby and toddler market

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children under age 12 avoid caffeine entirely, and that adolescents between 12-18 have no more than 100 mg per day. But an estimated 30%-50% of adolescents in the U.S. still consume energy drinks, many of which contain between 160-300 mg of caffeine per can. Some high schools even make them available in vending machines and cafeterias. Making them all the more risky is that many “are marketed in a way that makes them appear not to be energy drinks — not to be highly caffeinated products that could potentially be dangerous,” said Frances Fleming-Milici, director of marketing initiatives at the UConn Rudd Center for Food Policy and Health.

Research has linked energy drinks to cardiovascular issues like arrhythmias and, in rare but potentially fatal cases, sudden cardiac arrest, along with a wide range of health problems like seizures, stomach problems, poor sleep, and higher levels of stress and anxiety. That said, it can be difficult to tell whether energy drinks are a direct cause of such health problems or merely correlated with them. The most recent data from America’s Poison Centers shows an uptick in calls about exposure to energy drinks in children and teens up to age 19, with 2,609 calls in 2024.

Energy drinks, the 24/7 beverage

The health risks of energy drinks were a hot topic in the U.S. about a decade ago. Since then, the market has only grown. As of 2025, there were 254 energy drink businesses in the U.S., compared to just 49 in 2015.

“What we’ve learned over the years is that energy is a need state” for which there’s round-the-clock demand, said Michael Bellas, head of the research and consulting firm Beverage Marketing Corporation. Other than water, he said, energy is the No. 1 fuel that today’s anxious, hassled consumer relies upon: “You can do it 24/7.”

Leaning into that broad appeal, energy drinks are increasingly blending into the broader functional beverage market alongside probiotic sodas, hydrating sports drinks, and adaptogenic elixirs containing ingredients like hemp or ashwagandha meant to help with mood and stress.

The $9 billion Celsius strategically built its brand within the health and beauty category in grocery stores, “next to the Atkins and the protein bars,” as CEO John Fieldly said in a recent interview, and then became affiliated with the wellness movement during Covid. Now the third-most-popular energy drink in the U.S. after Monster and Red Bull, a 12-ounce can of Celsius contains 200 mg of caffeine per can — half of the maximum daily amount considered safe for adults. (Twelve ounces of coffee contains anywhere from 113 mg to 247 mg of caffeine, according to the FDA.) Though it’s labeled as an energy drink, some find it easy to mentally miscategorize: It’s often shelved alongside sparkling and flavored waters in grocery stores, featuring a “Live Fit” motto and minimalist packaging with pictures of berries or passion fruit.

High school and college-age women are drawn to Celsius because it’s low-calorie, experts say, and claims to help speed up metabolism. The Wall Street Journal reports the drinks are popular among young women with eating disorders, who may be more susceptible to adverse effects from too much caffeine. Celsius also markets itself as a pre- or post-workout drink, holding influencer events at the Pilates-inspired gym Solidcore — which also sells cans in studios at a discount to members. “That’s something that is really not recommended to do at any age, is to consume these products and exert yourself and exercise,” said Fleming-Milici.

The American College of Sports Medicine recommends that energy drinks be avoided before, during, and after strenuous activities, noting that some deaths allegedly linked to energy drinks happened under those circumstances. In the past year, Katie Donnell, a teacher who habitually drank three energy drinks a day as part of her workout routine, died after a heart attack at age 28. Eighteen-year-old mixed martial arts athlete Zach Doran, who had a fatal heart attack, reportedly consumed energy drinks regularly. It’s not known whether or to what extent the energy drinks played a role in their deaths.

Other energy drinks are leaning less into wellness and more into partnerships with brands and flavors associated with childhood innocence. Ghost and C4 have energy drinks in varieties like Welch’s Grape, Sour Patch Kids, and Popsicle. If it sounds like those might appeal to young kids, there are several regulatory complaints and a recently dismissed class-action lawsuit that make exactly that argument.

In her research on energy drink consumption among teens and children, Teesside University public health nutrition professor Amelia Lake found that parents were using energy drinks as breakfast substitutes. “The word energy is really positive — it’s going to give you energy and improve concentration,” she said.

Back in 2018, Lake campaigned with celebrity chef Jamie Oliver to curb sales of the product to young people in the U.K., prompting a number of grocery store chains to voluntarily instate age requirements. Energy drinks “remain the fastest-growing sector within the soft drink market,” said Lake, who is also the deputy director of Fuse, an inter-university center for translational research in public health. “They are highly profitable, and their manufacturers will say they are not marketing to children or young people. But when they are associated with everything that is part of youth culture — music, extreme sport — they can’t help being part of youth culture.”

The health risks of energy drinks

The most serious risks of energy drinks involve their impact on the heart, said Vetter, the pediatric cardiologist. “They increase heart rate, do all of these abnormal things — it can increase the likelihood of having a coronary event, a blockage of the artery, or a perforation of the artery,” she said. “Anybody who is more susceptible to these things is going to be more significantly affected, but a lot of people don’t know they’re at risk” — particularly young people who haven’t lived long enough for an underlying heart condition to be identified.

A Mayo Clinic study published last year found that seven out of 144 survivors of sudden cardiac arrest had consumed an energy drink within 12 hours of the event. Four of the survivors had heart rhythm disorders, while three had no clear underlying cause. That’s a small sample size, and the authors note that energy drinks may be just one of several factors contributing to the “perfect storm” of circumstances that led to the sudden cardiac arrest. But they found sufficient evidence to say that energy drinks could be triggering for people with underlying heart disorders, and urged the Food and Drug Administration to provide guidelines about energy drink consumption and risks.



Coffee, of course, also contains caffeine — but it’s less trendy among young people, less concentrated, and less likely to be downed quickly as a pre- or post-workout beverage. And it’s not just the caffeine that’s a potential risk for people with underlying conditions. “The energy drinks have a lot of other substances in them,” Vetter explained, the effects of which are not fully understood.

Beyond heart issues, health experts have also sounded alarms about links between energy drinks and seizures, gastrointestinal problems, dental issues (varieties like Monster often contain as much sugar as soda), and worse mental health — potentially because of all that tossing and turning that over-caffeinated people tend to do instead of sleep. Studies have linked energy drink consumption among young people with higher levels of anxiety, depression, stress, and insomnia.

“What happens is, you feel good immediately and then there’s a big crash,” said Vetter.

Energy drink bans and caffeine labeling proposals

Concerned about the potential harms for people whose bodies are still developing, countries in Europe are increasingly cracking down on sales of energy drinks to minors. Lithuania, Latvia, Turkey, the Galicia region of Spain, and Sweden have age requirements, and more recently Poland and Kazakhstan have followed suit. The U.K. Labor party pledged last year to ban energy drinks for children under 16 if elected to power (they won, though no law has been announced yet), and Czech lawmakers are moving forward with a similar ban.



In the U.S., the Sarah Katz Caffeine Safety Act, a House bill introduced by Rep. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) in March, would introduce some restrictions. Named after Katz, a 21-year-old college student who died from cardiac arrest in 2023 after drinking Panera Bread’s Charged Lemonade, the bill would introduce new requirements, such as a “high caffeine” notice on restaurant menus for beverages with more than 150 mg, and require government agencies to further study the safety of caffeine and other ingredients in energy drinks, as well as energy drinks’ marketing tactics.

With the Make America Healthy Again movement calling attention to the health impacts of sugary drinks like soda and the concern that many people feel over the safety of food ingredients, Menendez is hopeful about the bill’s chances. But for now, the U.S. has comparatively few regulations in place: Previous attempts by Congress and state officials yielded only a voluntary commitment from manufacturers.

Not only is there no minimum age for purchases of energy drinks in the U.S., some are regulated by the FDA as dietary supplements rather than as soft drinks — meaning they can bypass the FDA’s limit of 71 mg of caffeine per 12 ounces of carbonated soda.

Figuring out exactly how much caffeine an energy drink contains requires some detective work, and often a pair of reading glasses. Companies can place information about a drink’s amount of caffeine anywhere on the packaging — often in tiny type and consistently without context about the recommended daily limit.

Alina Yang, a high school junior in New York’s Westchester County, said drinks like Celsius and Red Bull are a common accessory among her classmates. But her family has a history of heart disease, and as the founder of Guardians of the Heart, a nonprofit focused on educating young people about cardiovascular disease prevention, she tries to let her peers know that energy drinks can be a problem. The trouble is, she said, “adolescents don’t do anything until something bad happens to them.”

In a March 2025 letter to the editor for The Journal of Pediatrics, Yang described how influencers on TikTok and elsewhere can make energy drinks seem like not just a habit but a symbol of achievement. The medical students she watches for career inspiration on social media often guzzle the beverages while preparing for exams. The videos, which are sometimes sponsored by energy drink brands, are bound to make people like her wonder: “Oh, if that’s the path I want to go, are those the habits I have to have and the decisions I’d have to make?”

That’s the kind of logic that health experts worry could turn young people into lifelong energy drink customers. “Once we start dietary behaviors,” Lake said, “it’s really hard to change.”

Just like we care for other aspects of our health, there are steps we can take to support brain health and lower the risk of dementia as we age, according to Professor Jonathan Schott, professor of neurology at UCL and chief medical officer at Alzheimer’s Research UK.

Professor Schott has outlined six easy ways to give your brain a boost this summer.

1. Learn a new skill (that you enjoy)

“Keep your brain active by doing the things that you enjoy doing,” recommends Schott. “I’ve previously said, ‘If you hate Sudoku, don’t do Sudoku’ as you’re not going to stick with it.”

It’s more about finding whatever keeps you engaged and stimulated, he emphasises.

“For some people, that’s reading a book, for others it will be playing chess or learning a new skill like crochet,” says Schott.

Learning a new skill, or getting better at a pre-existing one, helps keep your brain flexible, explains the neurology professor.

“What we think is, when you learn new skills, those areas [in the brain] get connected better together and the connections get stronger – that’s why when you repeat a skill over and over and over again then that movement becomes more automatic,” says Schott. “And we think that it probably makes the brain a bit more resilient.”

2. Do something active every day

“I think exercising is the single best thing that we can do,” says Schott. “We talk at Alzheimer’s Research UK about what’s good for your heart is good for your brain, and that’s because lots of the risk factors for your heart are also risk factors for brain diseases as well.

“Exercise can lower your blood pressure, can lower your cholesterol, can take your weight down and gives you a sense of wellbeing.

“Ideally, you want to be doing a little bit of exercise every day and want to be doing something that gets your heart rate substantially elevated for at least 20 minutes three or four times a week.”

There is also growing evidence that suggests exercise can buffer some of the effects of the causes of dementia in the brain.

“The mechanisms aren’t entirely clear, but it’s likely that the chemicals that get released from the muscles get into the brain and may actually alter this,” he adds.

3. Go on regular walks

“What’s really interesting is that it does not need to be hugely vigorous exercise,” says Schott. “We’re not talking about running marathons, we’re talking about walking every day or walking up the stairs rather than taking a lift.

“Some of the research that we’ve done suggests that it’s actually relatively small but sustained amount of activity throughout your life, that may be the most beneficial.”

Walking with others also offers additional valuable social benefits, and Alzheimer’s Research UK is set to host a variety of Walk For A Cure events across the UK this summer – ranging from family-friendly, accessible 5km routes to more challenging 42km hikes.

4. Stay connected

Several studies also suggest that social isolation can raise the risk of dementia, so staying connected with others is a powerful way to support your brain health.

“Do things that you really enjoy doing yourself, but also with other people,” recommends Schott. “Staying connected helps you keep in touch with people, you get feedback on people and you can also compare how your brain performance is to other people’s.

“When I have someone who says to me, I’m a bit worried about my memory, my immediate thought is to say what’s your memory like compared to those people you hang out with?”

5. Get your blood pressure checked

“Keeping an eye on your blood pressure is really important,” says Schott. “We and others have found that it’s your blood pressure in your 30s and your 40s which actually may have the most impact on your brain health.”

The professor explains that monitoring blood pressure is important because dementia generally stems from two main causes: neurodegenerative diseases and cerebrovascular disease, with the latter involving damage to the brain’s blood vessels.

“By reducing the blood pressure, we think we’re probably putting less strain on the blood vessels in the brain, which makes them more robust and less likely to get clogged or less likely to burst,” he explains.

6. Complete Alzheimer's UK’s Think Brain Health Check-in

“I would suggest that everybody does our Think Brain Health Check-in,” recommends Schott. “It’s been used by over half a million people in the UK, and you can go in and you can put in your own personal circumstances, and it’ll ask you questions about things like exercise, smoking, diet and alcohol, and will come up with some easy-to-follow advice.”

Why Trust Us?

By now, we all know that our mental health is inextricably intertwined with our physical health. Going on a run or walk outside can boost your mood. Your eczema can worsen depression symptoms. The things we eat can find a direct route to our brains.

And while we already know that citrus fruits and creatine have positive impacts on the brain, new research suggests there's another key ingredient that could help with mood and energy. Yep, a study found that adding probiotics to your regimen could have a big influence on feelings of anxiety, depression, and stress.

It’s important to point out that anxiety and depression are complicated conditions, and it’s hard to say at this point that taking a probiotic will magically make you stress-free and super happy. But adding this supp to your daily health regimen may help enhance the other brain and mood-boosting things you already do.

Here’s what the study found, plus what mental health experts and a gastroenterologist want you to keep in mind.

Meet the experts: Katerina V.A. Johnson, PhD, lead study author and postdoctoral researcher at Leiden University; Ashkan Farhadi, MD, a gastroenterologist at MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA; Thea Gallagher, PsyD, clinical associate professor at NYU Langone Health and cohost of the podcast

What did the study find?

For the study, researchers recruited 88 people who had not taken taken antibiotics or probiotics in the past three months and didn’t use any medication (other than hormonal contraception for women). Half of the participants were given probiotics that contained nine common bacterial strains, and the other half were given a placebo to take daily for four weeks. Before and after the study period, the participants were asked to answer questions about their emotional state, along with their bowel health.

At the end of the study period, the researchers found that people in the probiotic group reported fewer negative feelings like anxiety, stress, fatigue, or depression, compared to those in the placebo group. “We find a clear signal that probiotics improve negative mood in healthy volunteers based on daily reporting,” the researchers wrote in the study.

“This is the first study to track people’s mood daily to assess the effects of probiotics and in fact, by the end of the month-long study, their negative mood still appears to be improving,” says Katerina V.A. Johnson, PhD, lead study author and postdoctoral researcher at Leiden University.

What are probiotics?

Probiotics are live microorganisms that are designed to have health benefits when you ingest them or apply them to your body, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH).

Most of the microorganisms that are in probiotic products and supplements are similar to bacteria that naturally live in your body. So, probiotics are usually used to try to support good digestion and to curate a healthy gut microbiome, per the NCCIH.

Why are probiotics good for you?

Research into probiotics is ongoing, but the NCCIH says they may do the following for your health:

Help your body foster a healthy gut microbiome or help it return to a healthy state

Create essential short-chain fatty acids that will have a positive effect on your body and gut

Support your immune system

How do they help stress, anxiety and fatigue?

That’s still being explored. “There’s no more information about the mechanism of the gut-brain connection from this,” says Thea Gallagher, PsyD, clinical associate professor at NYU Langone Health and cohost of the podcast. “But it seems like we’re getting closer to understanding why there is a connection and how it works.”

Still, these new findings make total sense to Ashkan Farhadi, MD, a gastroenterologist at MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA. ""The gut-brain axis is being expanded to become the gut-brain-microbiome axis,"" he says. Dr. Farhadi points out that the majority of serotonin, which is the main neurotransmitter that influences mood and happiness, is produced in the gut.

""Bacteria are in the vicinity and they are modulating the function of the gut,"" he says. ""It's not surprising that they can effect those neurotransmitters, but it's through a mechanism that we're not quite aware of.""

Johnson also says there may be some overlap in the body systems influenced by antidepressants and probiotics. “The improvement in negative mood in those taking probiotics starts to show up after around two weeks, which is the same amount of time it typically takes for the effects of antidepressants to be felt,"" she says.

This, to Johnson, was one of the more interesting findings.

As to why that is? “It may be a sign that both antidepressants and probiotics can affect our mood through shared pathways,” Johnson continues. “We know that both can signal to the brain via the vagus nerve—the main nerve connecting the gut and brain—and also that they both have anti-inflammatory effects.”

What are the best probiotics to take?

First and foremost, you can get probiotics through your diet. Some common sources include yogurt, kefir, pickles, miso, and kimchi.

Johnson suggests leaning into these natural sources. And if those foods just aren't going to find a home in your diet and you're still interested in taking a probiotic supplement (with your doctor's okay!), these are some of WH's favorites:

As with any supplement, it’s important to talk to your healthcare provider before adding something new to your health routine. But Dr. Farhadi says probiotics are a pretty ""harmless"" one to take. ""I may suggest that people give it a shot and try it out,"" he says. ""I don't see any harm in doing so."""|"And while we already know that citrus fruits and creatine have positive impacts on the brain, new research suggests there's another key ingredient that could help with mood and energy.

The unidentified man who is in his 70s went to the hospital after he saw blood in his stool - believing it was due to the colonoscopy he had the day before.

But while examining him, doctors also noticed large, dark bruises on both of his arms that had developed within the span of a few days.

Tests revealed he was suffering from hemophilia A, where the body prevents blood from clotting, causing excessive bleeding from wounds for days at end.

This prolonged bleeding can cause blood to accumulate beneath the skin, forming a bruise and make the body more susceptible to injuries.

In this particular case, since the patient had sustained wounds from a colorectal procedure, they were mostly bleeding internally and the blood was only visible in their stool.

The patient had no family history of the condition and was not actively bleeding, according to a medical report about his case.

However, they traced his symptoms back a week after the elderly patient had received his Moderna Covid vaccine booster - marking it as his fifth shot.

The experts theorized that it was possible the shot triggered his immune system to produce antibodies against his body's clotting process and caused the disorder.

Doctors traced his symptoms back a week after the elderly patient had received his Moderna Covid vaccine booster - marking it as his fifth shot

Typically, mRNA vaccines work by prompting the immune system to produce SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins to attack the Covid virus in the body through a piece of genetic code.

However, in this case doctors believe that it may be possible that the vaccine also made the body stop recognizing its own cells as safe and began developing antibodies against the clotting process.

Experts have noted that adverse reactions to Covid vaccines are extremely rare and that the benefits of getting the shot outweigh potential complications

After his diagnosis, the experts reviewed 21 cases of AHA developing in patients after receiving Covid vaccines between 2020 to 2022 and discovered that they usually were in their 70s and symptoms tend to show 14 days after receiving the shot.

They also noted that the condition can be fatal in about 10.3 percent of cases which is why early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for survival.

AHA can cause bleeding in the skin, muscles, and soft tissues but more concerningly, it can also lead to internal bleeding, including in the brain and gastrointestinal tract - which if not controlled, can cause the body to start bleeding out and in certain cases, lead to death.

It remains unclear exactly how the vaccine triggered specific clotting antibody production in the patients' bodies.

Most cases OF AHA occurred after people received their first or second dose of the Covid vaccine - when the immune response is highest.

However, this particular man developed the bleeding disorder after his fifth dose - making his case distinct.

When the elderly man initially went to the doctors, his white blood cell count, platelets count, liver and kidney function all appeared normal during tests.

But much to their surprise, the bruising on his arms continued to worsen and he developed large marks on his left knee two weeks later - prompting doctors to order more intensive blood tests which included a plasma test.

Results showed that while his white cell and platelets counts were normal, they were certain antibodies present in his plasma that were not allowing the body's clotting process to function.

Further testing showed that his body's FVIII, crucial protein involved in forming blood clots to stop bleeding, levels were only at one percent in his body.

As a result, he was diagnosed with acquired hemophilia A - which is known to primarily target the FVIII protein in the body.

Typical symptoms of this condition include nosebleeds, bruising throughout the body, solid swellings of congealed blood, blood in the urine and gastrointestinal bleeding.

Your browser does not support iframes.

Consequently, patients also develop also complications associated with abnormal, uncontrolled bleeding into the muscles, skin and soft tissue that can occur spontaneously, during surgery or following trauma.

While it is usually treatable, AHA can potentially cause life-threatening bleeding complications in certain cases.

Experts estimate that the condition affects about two people per a million in the US - meaning that it is diagnosed in nearly 1,000 people in a population of 340 million people.

As for treatment, the elderly man was asked to visit a haematology clinic every week and began taking cyclophosphamide (an immunosuppressant medication used to treat autoimmune diseases).

The doctors progressively decreased his cyclophosphamide dosage as his FVIII levels improved and he showed signs of recovery.

Along with this, he was also given medications to prevent fungal infections and protect the stomach."|"A Washington DC man was left excessively bleeding due to a rare side effect linked to his Covid vaccine booster.

Over time, their built-in repair mechanisms also fail. Knee cartilage grinds away. Hip joints no longer support weight. Treatments for breast cancer and other health issues require removal by surgery. Because the body can’t regenerate those tissues, reconstruction using biomaterials is often the only way.

Traditionally, this kind of restoration involves one-size-fits-all breast implants or hip joints. More recently, 3D bioprinted tissues have begun to be tailored for patients. But these artificial tissues are printed outside of the body, and they still require additional surgeries to implant, adding to the chances of scarring, inflammation, or infection, and increasing healing time.

This month, a team from the California Institute of Technology unveiled a system to 3D print tissues inside the body—no surgery needed. Dubbed deep tissue in vivo sound printing (DISP), the system uses an injectable bioink that’s liquid at body temperature but solidifies into structures when blasted with ultrasound. A monitoring molecule, also sensitive to ultrasound, tracks tissue printing in real time. Excess bioink is safely broken down by the body.

In tests, the team 3D printed tissues inside a rabbit’s stomach and mouse’s bladder. They also added conductive nanoparticles to make soft biosensors and depots of medication—anticancer drugs or antibacterial medications—that released their payloads when hit with ultrasound.

“This work has really expanded the scope of ultrasound-based printing and shown its translational capacity,” Yu Shrike Zhang at Harvard Medical School, who was not involved in the research, told IEEE Spectrum. “It’s quite exciting.”

From Light to Sound

Thanks to its versatility, 3D printing has captured the imagination of bioengineers. The technology can be used to make artificial biological tissues, organs, or medical devices.

Bioprinters usually deposit one layer at a time. Each layer is solidified using light, then the next layer is laid on top of it. This layer-by-layer process takes time. More recently, an upgraded method called volumetric printing solidifies 3D structures with a single blast of carefully tailored light. The approach is faster but also constrained by how deeply light can pierce tissues.

Infrared light, for example, can shape implants under a thin layer of skin and muscle, Xiao Kuang at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, who was not involved in the study, wrote in Science. But light dims and scatters the deeper it goes inside the body. This limits the “direct printing of implants beneath millimeter-thick tissues”—or barely below the skin.

Ultrasound, best known for its use monitoring pregnancies, has an advantage here. It can reach deep into organs—nearly eight inches—without damaging them. Scientists have been exploring focused ultrasound, which blasts a certain frequency of soundwaves towards a tissue, as a way to monitor brain and muscle activity.

Ultrasound can also trigger chemical reactions. In 2023, Zhang and colleagues engineered a molecular concoction dubbed “sono-ink” that solidifies when blasted with a specific frequency of sound waves. The team 3D printed multiple shapes inside isolated pork belly, liver, and kidneys and patched tissue damage in a goat heart.

But the ink was sensitive to stress and other disruptions in the body, resulting in slower printing and poor resolution. Sound waves also generate heat, which hardened some of the sono-ink before it had formed the intended structures. Further, other molecules in the ink and local heat spikes across tissues increased biocompatibility risk.

“Ultrasound 3D printing inside a body is more challenging than it seems,” wrote Kuang.

A New Ink

The new system relies on upgraded sono-ink.

The ink has multiple components combined into a single concoction. First up are chains of molecules that normally float about freely but grasp each other when given a molecular cue. These are accompanied by fatty bubbles filled with binder molecules—the molecular cue—that release their payloads when exposed to ultrasound. A final encapsulated component includes multiple chemicals that scatter sound waves and light up when certain soundwaves hit. These help the team visualize the ink’s location and determine if it’s formed the desired structure.

The new setup “prevented premature chemical reactions at body temperature and provided better control of the printing process,” wrote Kuang."|"This month, a team from the California Institute of Technology unveiled a system to 3D print tissues inside the body—no surgery needed.

Low-ranking male mice showed stronger reward signals and weaker control circuits, making them more prone to seek methamphetamine, while high-ranking mice had better balance and resistance.

Enhancing the mesocortical “control” pathway through optogenetics reduced drug-seeking and improved social rank, suggesting experience-based changes can reshape addiction risk. Interestingly, these effects were sex-specific, with female mice showing drug-seeking behavior regardless of status.

Key Facts:

Circuit Imbalance: Low social rank is linked to stronger reward signals and weaker executive control.

Drug addiction poses a global public health challenge, with limited therapeutic options and modest efficacy. While numerous studies have shown that social status profoundly impacts mental health and addiction susceptibility, its neural mechanisms remain unclear.

Now, however, a research team led by Prof. ZHU Yingjie from the Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology (SIAT) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has revealed the neural mechanisms by which social rank influences vulnerability to drug addiction.

To understand these mechanisms, the researchers used both pharmacological and optogenetic approaches to manipulate dopamine signaling. Credit: Neuroscience News

The study was published in Nature Neuroscience on May 12.

Using a suite of cutting-edge neuroscience tools such as fiber photometry, fast-scan cyclic voltammetry, optogenetic manipulation, and volumetric imaging, the researchers explored both functional and structural differences in the dopamine systems of male rodents occupying different social ranks.

These tools allowed them to measure real-time neuronal activity, detect rapid chemical changes (particularly dopamine), manipulate neural circuits with light, and capture high-speed 3D images of brain activity.

The findings revealed that an animal’s social rank influences its tendency to seek methamphetamine (METH) by affecting the mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways—two key dopamine pathways in the brain.

The mesolimbic pathway delivers dopamine to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and promotes reward-seeking behavior, whereas the mesocortical pathway, which projects to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and supports executive control, helping suppress compulsive drug use.

“Low-ranking mice exhibit a stronger ‘reward’ circuit and a weaker ‘control’ circuit —like a high-powered car with faulty brakes—making them more likely to seek drugs. In contrast, high-ranking mice have a more balanced system, with effective ‘brakes’ that help them resist addiction,” explained Prof. ZHU.

To understand these mechanisms, the researchers used both pharmacological and optogenetic approaches to manipulate dopamine signaling.

When dopamine-related proteins in the NAc of low-ranking male mice were reduced, their METH-seeking behavior declined. In contrast, when dopamine fibers in the mPFC of high-ranking male mice were damaged, drug-seeking behavior increased.

Most strikingly, activating the mesocortical dopamine pathway via optogenetic stimulation not only made the mice win a social competition test more often; it also made them much less likely to seek METH in subsequent trials.

Notably, the study also found that these effects were sex-specific: Female mice exhibited METH-seeking behavior regardless of social rank, suggesting different neurobiological underpinning of addiction risk in male and females.

Importantly, the researchers found that introducing winning experiences to low-ranking male mice not only elevated their social rank but also reduced later drug-seeking behavior. These behavioral changes were linked to functional and structural remodeling in both the mesocortical and mesolimbic dopamine pathways.

This study introduces a novel neurobiological framework linking social status, dopamine circuit dynamics, and addiction vulnerability.

“By boosting an individual’s sense of social achievement or simulating successful experiences, it may be possible—at the neural level—to ‘strengthen the brakes and ease off the accelerator,’ thereby reducing addiction risk,” said Prof. ZHU.

He noted that the study also supports the development of non-invasive stimulation therapies aimed at reducing addiction vulnerability.

“Social rank modulates methamphetamine-seeking in dominant and subordinate male rodents via distinct dopaminergic pathways” by ZHU Yingjie et al. Nature Neuroscience

Abstract

Social rank modulates methamphetamine-seeking in dominant and subordinate male rodents via distinct dopaminergic pathways

Social status has a profound impact on mental health and propensity towards drug addiction. However, the neural mechanisms underlying the effects of social rank on drug-seeking behavior remain unclear.

Here we found that dominant male rodents (based on the tube test) had denser mesocortical dopaminergic projections and were more resistant to methamphetamine (METH)-seeking, whereas subordinates had heightened dopaminergic function in the mesolimbic pathway and were more vulnerable to METH seeking.

Optogenetic activation of the mesocortical dopaminergic pathway promoted winning and suppressed METH seeking in subordinates, whereas lesions of the mesocortical pathway increased METH seeking in dominants.

Elevation of social rank with forced win training in subordinates led to remodeling of the dopaminergic system and prevented METH-seeking behavior.

In females, however, both ranks were susceptible to METH seeking, with mesocorticolimbic pathways comparable to those in subordinate males.

These results provide a framework for understanding the neural basis of the impact of social status on drug-seeking."|"Summary: A new study reveals how social rank influences addiction vulnerability by altering dopamine pathways in the brain.

341|https://www.earth.com/news/hospital-superbugs-devour-medical-plastics-boosting-infection-risks/|Hospital 'superbugs' devour medical plastics, boosting infection risks|2025-05-12 17:57:11|"Scientists have discovered that a notorious hospital bacterium can digest the very plastics used in sutures, stents, and surgical mesh. By turning the polymer into food, the microbe may cling more stubbornly to devices and linger longer on ward surfaces.

Researchers from Brunel University London, working with a patient-derived strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, found that the pathogen dismantles polycaprolactone (PCL), a biodegradable plastic common in modern medicine.

The insight challenges the assumption that clinical polymers are immune to microbial attack.

Turning hospital plastics into food

The team traced the plastic-eating trick to a single enzyme, which they named Pap1. In laboratory tests, Pap1 reduced a thin PCL film by seventy-eight percent within seven days. The bacterium then used the liberated fragments as its sole carbon source.

“It means we need to reconsider how pathogens exist in the hospital environment,” said professor Ronan McCarthy, who led the study.

“Plastics, including plastic surfaces, could potentially be food for these bacteria. Pathogens with this ability could survive for longer in the hospital environment. It also means that any medical device or treatment that contains plastic could be susceptible to degradation by bacteria.”

PCL is prized because it bends without snapping, melts at low temperatures, and gradually dissolves in the body. Those traits make it ideal for resorbable sutures, drug-delivery patches, and soft tissue scaffolds.

Until now, surgeons assumed the material would vanish only through hydrolysis and harmless metabolic clearance. Pap1 shows that microbes can accelerate the process – and exploit it.

Plastic boosts bacterial defenses

When P. aeruginosa chews up plastic, it gains more than nourishment. The broken polymer pieces help the cells weave tougher biofilms, those gluey communal layers that resist disinfectants, immune cells, and multiple classes of antibiotics.

Catheter-related urinary tract infections and ventilator-associated pneumonia already rank among the hardest hospital infections to treat. PCL degradation could fortify the culprit’s defenses, complicating therapy even further.

The World Health Organization lists P. aeruginosa among the top “critical” pathogens in need of new drugs. Its uncanny ability to evolve resistance and to thrive in damp, nutrient-poor niches makes it a frequent cause of persistent outbreaks.

The study showed that plastic may be an unexpected reservoir of calories, tipping survival odds further in the germ’s favor.

More bacteria may digest plastic

The researchers looked at genetic databases and spotted related enzyme blueprints in other bacteria known to haunt intensive-care units.

Though only PCL digestion was proven, the sequence hints suggest that plastics such as polyurethane or polyethylene terephthalate – used in everything from vascular grafts to wound dressings – might also be vulnerable.

“The bug’s plastic-eating ability is likely helping it survive on surfaces in hospitals, potentially driving hospital outbreaks. We should start to consider focusing on plastics that are harder for microbes to digest and potentially screening pathogens for these enzymes, especially in unexplained prolonged outbreaks,” McCarthy said.

That prospect affects far more than one operating theatre. Cardiac stents, breast implants, dental membranes and bone fillers all rely on polymers for flexibility and strength. If any of those materials can be metabolized, latent infections might smolder undetected until biofilms reach critical mass.

Designing safer plastics

One response is to redesign polymers so their chemical bonds resist enzymatic cleavage. Another is to coat device surfaces with inert barriers or embedded antimicrobials that deny bacteria a foothold.

Any such solution must preserve the mechanical virtues that made PCL popular in the first place while preventing degradation inside the body.

Research chemists may also mine Pap1 itself for clues. By mapping its active site, they could predict which molecular motifs invite attack and which repel it. That information could steer the next generation of hospital plastics toward safer territory.

Rethinking hospital surveillance

Hospitals already culture swabs from taps, beds, and keyboard covers. The new data suggest laboratories should add targeted searches for plastic-digesting enzymes.

Environmental isolates that test positive might explain outbreaks whose source has eluded standard surveillance. Cleaning protocols could likewise shift focus: scrubbing away visible grime is not enough if bacteria can tuck inside the polymer and nibble at its chains.

McCarthy emphasizes that the present work is an early step. It examined one strain, one enzyme, and one polymer under controlled conditions. Real-world environments mix many microbes, variable temperatures, and diverse materials.

“Plastic is everywhere in modern medicine, and it turns out some pathogens have adapted to degrade it, and we need to understand the impact this has on patient safety,” McCarthy said.

Next experiments on the horizon

Future studies will test explanted devices for microscopic bite marks, track enzyme genes across hospital genomes and expose other medical plastics to potential degraders.

Animal models may reveal whether in-body digestion changes implant strength or releases inflammatory by-products. Parallel work on coatings and polymer chemistry will explore defenses.

For now, the image is sobering: a superbug perched on a catheter, slowly digesting the tube meant to heal, using the fragments to thicken its fortress and bide its time. The finding upends old assumptions and signals that in the quiet corners of a ward, plastic may not be inert at all – but a secret feast for the enemy within.

The study is published in the journal Cell Reports.

You know the feeling: it's the end of the week and you finally have time for some much-needed R&R. Maybe you hit the gym after work, head to the local park to chill with friends, or—if you're like me—unwind with a luxurious bubble bath. For many of us, kicking back often includes a drink or two. After all, consuming alcohol is commonly associated with stress relief, and there’s nothing wrong with enjoying a glass of something with dinner. But when it comes to whether you grab an ice-cold beer from the fridge or opt for a glass of wine to cap off your week, there are a few things worth considering.



Both beer and wine have their own benefits and downfalls. ""Neither is inherently better, but the context of consumption matters greatly,"" says registered dietitian Lauren Manaker, MS, RDN, LD, CLEC, CPT.

Health Benefits Of Wine

When comparing the two beverages, experts often highlight red wine for its health benefits. Registered dietitian Amy Brownstein, MS, RDN, notes that red wine in particular is loaded with polyphenols—antioxidants that may help protect the heart, lower ""bad"" LDL cholesterol, and reduce inflammation. For example, studies show that moderate red wine consumption can decrease LDL cholesterol, which is linked to a lower risk of artery-clogging and heart disease. ""Polyphenols in red wine help lower cholesterol by limiting how much the liver absorbs and preventing the breakdown of LDL cholesterol,"" Brownstein explains.

Additionally, red wine ""has been lauded for its antioxidants like resveratrol, which may support heart health,"" says Manaker. Resveratrol has been known to prevent plaque buildup on artery walls and has both anti-inflammatory and anti-aging potential.

""However,"" cautions Brownstein, ""despite promising research on resveratrol's health benefits, additional studies are needed to shape clinical guidance and recommendations. Moreover, it remains unclear if the resveratrol's benefits outweigh alcohol's negative health effects."" In fact, one study even concluded that it's not actually possible to absorb the recommended therapeutic dose of resveratrol solely by drinking wine, anyway. What a buzz kill.

What's more, Manaker tells us that some of the health benefits associated with red wine can also be found in grape juice, particularly when it comes to heart health. Shucks.

While some experts claim that red wine has a slight edge in health benefits when compared to white varietals, the differences are pretty negligible. White wine has fewer antioxidants and polyphenols, but still enough that it can help aid in digestion and support the immune system.

Health Benefits Of Beer

For beer drinkers, you'll be happy to discover that a number of brews contain certain B vitamins. ""Some types of beer,"" explains Manaker, ""especially craft and darker varieties, also contain antioxidants, though typically in smaller amounts than red wine."" Add to that recent studies that have shown moderate beer consumption is linked to a decrease in cardiovascular disease and overall mortality, not to mention its link to other metabolic health benefits, and that beer after work suddenly isn't looking too bad.

Downfalls Of Beer & Wine

While both beer and wine have their own purported health benefits, like anything, they should only be consumed in moderation. ""Alcohol of any kind can negatively impact liver health, disrupt sleep, and increase your risk of chronic conditions and addiction when consumed in excess,"" says Manaker.

She also points out another health consideration: ""These beverages come with calories, which can add up quickly, especially with beer, which is often consumed in larger quantities."" Generally, beer contains more calories per serving than wine, mainly due to its larger serving size and higher carbohydrate content.

For example, a standard 175 ml (about 6 oz) glass of 12% ABV wine has around 133 calories, while a pint (16 oz) of 5% ABV beer contains about 239 calories—making ""a beer"" roughly 50% higher in calories per typical serving than ""a glass"" of wine. (A serving of red wine is smaller than a serving of beer because it typically has a higher alcohol content, so it’s important to keep portion sizes in mind.) If you’re watching your calorie intake, light beers are a lower-calorie option, often containing fewer calories than both regular beer and wine.

Ultimately, both beer and wine are alcohol, which comes with serious health concerns. ""While sharing a glass of red wine with friends during a wholesome meal that includes fish, vegetables, and whole grains can absolutely be part of a healthy lifestyle for most, polishing off an entire bottle alone on the couch while binge-watching Love Island reruns is a different story,"" Manaker colorfully notes. ""Ultimately, the healthiest choice is to drink mindfully, within your personal limits, and as part of an overall balanced diet. Moderation and context are the keys!""

According to the CDC, ""moderate"" drinking is considered two drinks or less per day for men and one drink or less per day for women.

The Bottom Line

So when it comes down to it, which drink is actually better for your health? Manaker says it depends not only on your personal preferences, but also on your overall lifestyle. ""Both have potential health benefits in moderation, but it’s important first emphasize the key word: moderation,"" she says. Brownstein has a more definitive answer: ""Red wine would be considered healthier than beer due to its polyphenol content.""

Brownstein shares that one study found that those who moderately drink beer reported better self-perceived health, including better mental and physical health and social support, compared to people who did not drink, as well as former drinkers and those who consume high amounts of alcohol. However, she recommends weighing your decision whether or not to drink along with your healthcare provider and lifestyle, medical history, and health goals.

Sadly for those of us who love an end-of-day drink, the health benefits of wine and beer are modest at best, and don't seem to outweigh the cancer risks and other associated negatives of drinking. When it comes to beer vs. wine, there's not a hard and fast ""better"" option.

""Ultimately, enjoying either wine or beer is all about finding what works for you and pairing it with a healthy lifestyle,"" states Manaker. ""Both can bring enjoyment, whether during a meal or a social gathering, as long as they’re consumed thoughtfully.""

344|https://slate.com/advice/2025/05/marriage-advice-friend-husband-complaints.html|Help! My Friend Keeps Complaining About Her Husband. I Might Tell Him for My Own Sake.|2025-05-12 16:54:52.865000+00:00|"Dear Prudence is Slate’s advice column. Submit questions here.

Dear Prudence,

One of my best friends is going through a difficult patch in her marriage. They have two young kids, both work full-time, and she definitely carries the mental load. She has said they don’t communicate well, and that she is open to marriage counseling. However, she said it’s one thing too many for her to take on, so for them to go, he has to make the effort to do it. Apparently, he has suggested counseling in the past but never followed through. I think if they don’t, they are headed toward divorce.

Should I tell my friend’s husband he needs to do this, or stay out of it and watch them struggle? I’m not really friends with him, but we are cordial when we see each other. I don’t really want to get in the middle of it, but I also know she will lean heavily on me if they ever did get divorced, so part of me feels like I should tell him for my own sake.

—Concerned Friend

Dear Concerned Friend,

Nope. Don’t say anything. For a few reasons:

While counseling can be great, it isn’t a magic fix for a marriage, and it doesn’t guarantee that a couple will stay together. If it’s going to help, both people have to be invested in the process. Your friend and her husband lack the collective energy or willingness to make an appointment, which suggests they’re at least a bit checked out. This is sort of like how a high school student who needs major hand-holding to schedule their SATs, write essays, and apply may not actually be ready to succeed in college, where they’ll have to manage all their work independently. This couple’s failure to book an appointment without outside encouragement makes me think neither of them is currently in the right frame of mind to work hard to repair their relationship. He probably wouldn’t take your suggestion anyway. Creating a secret you then have to keep from your good friend is asking for trouble. Especially a secret that involves private conversations with her husband. Even if your intentions are pure, there’s a lot of potential for it to become messy and hurtful. What if he opens up and tells you that for him to want to stay married, she’d need to get rid of two-thirds of the throw pillows in the house, or stop leaving so much hair in the bathtub? Are you going to keep passing messages back and forth indefinitely? You could get in over your head.

What you should do instead is develop a plan for how you want to be there for your friend during this time, whether it turns out to be a long rough patch in her marriage or a divorce. I can tell you’re worried she’ll demand too much of you, or will expect you to help her figure out how to set up her new life if they split up. So think about what kind of support you’d like to provide—meaning, what will make you feel good and not resentful.

Get ahead of the situation and do that now, before you’re exhausted from your 12th session with her as an unpaid therapist or before she’s asked to come sleep on your couch while she looks for a new place, needs money for a lawyer, or is newly single and wants you to be her wing woman when she goes out looking for dates. Do it instead of just bracing for her overwhelming need.

That way if she does end up divorcing, instead of saying to yourself, “Oh God, she’s about to be so needy!” you can say to her, “I’m here for you and I’m ready to sit and listen every day on my drive home from work or for lunch every Wednesday”; “You know I’m not a big phone talker so I might not be the right person to process everything with you as it happens but I’ve planned us a weekend away to celebrate your new start”; or, “I have to be really diligent about keeping myself out of depression, so If I’m not engaged in all of the heavy conversations about this please know it’s not personal, but let me start researching lawyers for you and I’ll make up my guest room so you can come stay for as long as you want.”

Dear Prudence,

I’m a 24-year-old woman and was born as the product of my dad’s affair with my mom. His wife, “Ava,” took him back after finding out because she said they had to stay together for their children. I lived with Mom most of the time and spent occasional weekends and holidays at Dad’s with Ava and my half-sisters. Ava hated me. She fed me food I was allergic to multiple times or fed me nothing if I wouldn’t eat the allergens, screamed at me for every little thing, and would give my half-sisters extra love, attention, and random gifts while smirking at me. She told me regularly I was going to be a failure like my mother (and this is how I learned of my mom’s drug problems!). Dad was useless and only spoke nicely to me when the others were out of the room.

The only person who was kind to me was “Katherine,” my half-sister, who is near my age. She shared her presents and food, and we saw each other independently as teens. She’s a wonderful person, and we’re close as adults. We’re true sisters. Her older sister never acknowledges me. My mom died last year of an overdose and has left me a surprisingly large sum of money along with her house. It seems she won a lot gambling after I moved out at 18, because we were poor growing up. It’s been a lot to take in, honestly—my grief is complicated after years of neglect.

So far, I’ve used the money to pay off debts, and I mean to buy a house. Katherine has been really struggling since the unplanned birth of her child, and I wanted to help her, so I’ve given her $10,000 along with letting her stay in my mom’s old house while she finds her feet. It feels great to pay back her kindness! The problem is that Dad and Ava have found out. They want “their share” of the money and feel my mom owed them for years of free child care. Ava called me first, pretending to be friendly, then threatening legal action against me! Dad has called me crying, wanting to know why I don’t care about my family anymore. He keeps bringing up that he gave me his old car in my teens as proof that he’s done a lot for me, and talking about all the child support he paid “despite how it hurt Ava.”

Prudie, I don’t owe them anything, right? Should I give a one-off gift to stop them from harassing me? Ava has sobbed to me that I don’t understand how hard it was for her, and that she’s sorry for taking things out on me. She says I can’t hold on to long-ago grievances forever. Is there any merit to this point, and can you advise on how I move forward?

—Demanding “Family”

Dear Demanding “Family,”

You can hold on to long-ago grievances for a lifetime, if you choose. Especially if they’re about the way you were mistreated as a child. Even if you didn’t have this grievance, your dad and Ava wouldn’t be entitled to your money. You don’t owe people for raising you, and especially not for raising you on occasional weekends and holidays during which they intentionally fed you food that would trigger your allergies. The fact that they call what they did “free child care” when you were just a kid spending time with her father says a lot about how they see you: not as their child or a real member of their family. It’s also worth noting that your dad and Ava didn’t show any interest in repairing their relationship with you until they thought it might lead to a windfall for them. Their gold-digging couldn’t be more transparent.

Absolutely do not give them a cent. And block their numbers. I don’t say that lightly, but the absence of any real relationship combined with their threats of legal action makes this a pretty easy call. Enjoy your new house, your relationship with Katherine, and your savings account.

A mouse study revealed that CAR-T-induced immune responses activate brain microglia, triggering inflammation that damages myelin-producing cells, reducing signal efficiency in the brain.

These effects mirror brain fog seen after chemotherapy and mild respiratory infections like COVID-19. Importantly, researchers identified two treatment strategies that reversed the impairment in mice, paving the way for potential therapies in humans.

Key Facts:

Independent Cause: CAR-T therapy alone can cause cognitive impairment, regardless of tumor location.

After treatment with CAR-T cells — immune cells engineered to attack cancer — patients sometimes tell their doctors they feel like they have “brain fog,” or forgetfulness and difficulty concentrating.

A new Stanford Medicine-led study shows that CAR-T cell therapy causes mild cognitive impairments, independent of other cancer treatments, and that this happens via the same cellular mechanism as cognitive impairment from two other causes: chemotherapy and respiratory infections such as flu and COVID-19.

The researchers demonstrated that the brain’s immune cells, called microglia, are key players in the problem. Credit: Neuroscience News

The study, conducted mostly in mice, which will publish online May 12 in Cell, also identifies strategies for reversing the problem.

Medications that ameliorate brain fog will enable better recovery from cancer immunotherapies, the researchers said.

“CAR-T cell therapy is enormously promising: We are seeing long-term survivors after CAR-T cell therapy for aggressive cancers, saving patients who would otherwise have died,” said the study’s senior author, Michelle Monje, MD, PhD, the Milan Gambhir Professor in Pediatric Neuro-Oncology.

“We need to understand all its possible long-term effects, including this newly recognized syndrome of immunotherapy-related cognitive impairment, so we can develop therapeutic approaches to fix it.”

The study’s lead authors are Anna Geraghty, PhD, senior staff scientist in the Monje lab, and MD/PhD student Lehi Acosta-Alvarez.

Cognitive impairment after CAR-T cell therapy is typically mild; patients are not developing dementia, for instance. But it is frustrating and may not resolve on its own, Monje said.

In mice, her team reversed the impairment using compounds similar to existing medications or medications in clinical development — meaning a treatment could be available relatively quickly, she said.

“We’re deeply interested in how cancer therapies affect cognition because it affects patients’ quality of life,” Monje said.

“And this is especially important for kids because their brains are still developing.”

Investigating brain fog

CAR-T cell therapy was approved for acute lymphoblastic leukemia in 2017. The treatment involves removing some of the patient’s own immune cells, known as T cells, and engineering them to attack targets on cancer cells. The modified T cells are returned to the patient’s body, where they recognize and destroy cancer.

In addition to leukemia, CAR-T cells are now used to treat other blood cancers, including multiple myeloma and some kinds of lymphoma, and they are being tested in clinical trials for various solid tumors.

Monje and her colleagues have an ongoing trial of CAR-T cells for deadly brain stem and spinal cord tumors in children, which is beginning to show success.

Although patients report brain fog after CAR-T cell therapy, studies to measure how much cognitive impairment the therapy causes are only just emerging.

The research team wanted to get a comprehensive understanding of the situations in which CAR-T cell therapy might cause cognitive impairment. They studied mice that had tumors induced in the brain, blood, skin and bone.

The researchers wanted to understand the influence on cognition of CAR-T cell treatment in combination with the tumors’ location (originating in, spreading to or staying outside the brain), as well as the degree to which the engineered cells evoked additional, accompanying immune responses.

Before and after CAR-T cell treatment, the researchers used standard cognitive tests on the mice, measuring how mice responded to a novel object and navigated a simple maze.

CAR-T therapy caused mild cognitive impairment in mice with cancers originating in, metastasizing to and located completely outside the brain.

The only mice tested that did not develop cognitive impairment after CAR-T treatment were those that had bone cancer that causes minimal additional inflammation beyond the cancer-fighting activity of the CAR-T cells.

“This is the first study to demonstrate that immunotherapy on its own is sufficient to cause lasting cognitive symptoms,” Monje said.

“It’s also the first paper to uncover the mechanisms. We found the exact same pathophysiology we’ve seen in brain fog syndromes that occur after chemotherapy, radiation, and mild respiratory COVID-19 or influenza.”

The researchers demonstrated that the brain’s immune cells, called microglia, are key players in the problem. First, the microglia become activated by the body’s immune response.

The activated, “annoyed” microglia produce inflammatory immune molecules known as cytokines and chemokines, which in turn have widespread effects throughout the brain.

They are particularly harmful for oligodendrocytes, the brain cells responsible for making myelin, the fatty substance that insulates nerve fibers and helps nerves transmit signals more efficiently.

Reduction in the nerves’ insulation translates into cognitive impairment.

The scientists also analyzed samples of brain tissue from human subjects who participated in the team’s ongoing clinical trial of CAR-T cells for spinal cord and brain stem tumors.

Using postmortem tissue samples, the researchers confirmed that microglia and oligodendrocytes appear dysregulated in the same way the team had observed in mice after CAR-T therapy.

In mice, the research team tested strategies to resolve the cognitive problems. They gave a compound that depleted microglia in the brains of the mice for a two-week period. After that transient depletion, the microglia returned in the brain in a normal, non-reactive state. The mice were no longer cognitively impaired.

The researchers also gave the mice a medication that enters the brain and interferes with signals from damaging chemokines, blocking a specific receptor for these molecules.

“That alone rescued cognition,” Monje said, adding that the researchers are now exploring how to safely translate the two strategies — transiently depleting microglia or interrupting chemokine signals — in people who have had CAR-T cell therapy.

“This research further illustrates that there is a unifying principle underpinning brain fog syndromes,” Monje said. “And this particular study is so exciting because not only have we identified the cells central to this pathophysiology, we’ve found a molecular target we can investigate to treat it.”

“Immunotherapy-related cognitive impairment after CAR T cell therapy in mice” by Michelle Monje et al. Cell

Abstract

Immunotherapy-related cognitive impairment after CAR T cell therapy in mice

Immunotherapies have revolutionized cancer care for many tumor types, but their potential long-term cognitive impacts are incompletely understood.

Here, we demonstrated in mouse models that chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy for both central nervous system (CNS) and non-CNS cancers impaired cognitive function and induced a persistent CNS immune response characterized by white matter microglial reactivity, microglial chemokine expression, and elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytokines and chemokines.

Consequently, oligodendroglial homeostasis and hippocampal neurogenesis were disrupted.

Single-nucleus sequencing studies of human frontal lobe from patients with or without previous CAR T cell therapy for brainstem tumors confirmed reactive states of microglia and oligodendrocytes following treatment.

In mice, transient microglial depletion or CCR3 chemokine receptor blockade rescued oligodendroglial deficits and cognitive performance in a behavioral test of attention and short-term memory function following CAR T cell therapy.

Taken together, these findings illustrate targetable neural-immune mechanisms underlying immunotherapy-related cognitive impairment."|"“CAR-T cell therapy is enormously promising: We are seeing long-term survivors after CAR-T cell therapy for aggressive cancers, saving patients who would otherwise have died,” said the study’s senior author, Michelle Monje, MD, PhD, the Milan Gambhir Professor in Pediatric Neuro-Oncology.
Cognitive impairment after CAR-T cell therapy is typically mild; patients are not developing dementia, for instance.
Although patients report brain fog after CAR-T cell therapy, studies to measure how much cognitive impairment the therapy causes are only just emerging.
The research team wanted to get a comprehensive understanding of the situations in which CAR-T cell therapy might cause cognitive impairment.
CAR-T therapy caused mild cognitive impairment in mice with cancers originating in, metastasizing to and located completely outside the brain."|['mice', 'fog', 'covid', 'cells', 'brain', 'chemo', 'cart', 'cell', 'microglia', 'cancer', 'therapy', 'mirrors', 'cognitive', 'impairment']||Virginia|Virginia

That’s why experts consider the eyes ""the true windows into one’s health,"" says the American Optometric Association ( AOA ). And new research indicates that one of the best ways to protect your vision is with vitamin B supplementation, which can stunt the progression of glaucoma.

RELATED: The #1 Snack to Protect Your Vision, Eye Doctors Say.

Who's at risk for glaucoma?

In healthy people, ""fluid leaves the eye through the drainage angle, keeping pressure stable,"" as explained by the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO). But with glaucoma, excess fluid ""builds up in the front part of your eye,"" and subsequently, ""increases the pressure in your eye, damaging the optic nerve.""

Glaucoma can cause fuzzy vision, in which you might experience ""blind spots."" However, in more advanced cases, it can result in blindness.

""The optic nerve is made of more than a million tiny nerve fibers. It is like an electric cable made up of many small wires. As these nerve fibers die, you will develop blind spots in your vision. You may not notice these blind spots until most of your optic nerve fibers have died. If all of the fibers die, you will become blind,"" explains the AAO.

There are four different types of glaucoma:

Open-angle glaucoma

Acute angle-closure glaucoma

Normal-tension glaucoma

Pigmentary glaucoma

Known as the ""silent thief of sight,"" glaucoma is asymptomatic in its early stages. Half of people don’t even know they have it, which puts patients at greater risk of impaired vision or blindness if the condition remains undiagnosed, says the AAO. Glaucoma is a main trigger of blindness for people over 60. Common risk factors are:

Having high eye pressure

Being farsighted or nearsighted

Suffered an eye injury

Long-term steroid medication use

Having corneas that are thin in the center

Having thinning of the optic nerve

Diabetes, migraines, high blood pressure, poor blood circulation, or other health problems affecting the whole body

Family history of glaucoma

Those over the age of 40

Glaucoma is commonly treated with eye drops, though some patients may elect to have laser treatment or surgery. But in more recent news, a groundbreaking discovery shows that certain B vitamins can also help manage glaucoma.

RELATED: 94% of People With These Vision Problems Develop Alzheimer's, New Study Finds.

New research suggests that vitamin B supplements can help manage glaucoma.

Glaucoma isn’t reversible, though there are treatment options that can help slow its progression, one of which includes vitamin B supplements.

According to a new study published in the journal Cell Reports Medicine , vitamin B supplements, as well as the nutrient choline, can prevent neurodegeneration and protect visual function in patients with glaucoma. The supplements include vitamins B6, B9, and B12. Meanwhile, choline helps regulate memory , mood, muscle control, and other nervous system functions, per the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

Previous studies pointed to homocysteine (a type of amino acid) as the reason for the vitamins' effect. But researchers from the Karolinska Institute have seemingly debunked this theory, as their investigation shows that homocysteine is a consequence of glaucoma, not the root cause.

These findings stemmed from a rodent model, in which mice and rats with glaucoma saw noticeable improvements after taking B6, B9, and B12 supplements. In fact, damage to the optic nerve stopped in mice with slower-developing glaucoma. The rats were treated for a more aggressive form of the condition, which slowed in the presence of vitamin B supplements. Moreover, eye pressure wasn’t a variable, proving that glaucoma can be managed in unrelated ways.

""We demonstrate that homocysteine does not contribute to the progression of glaucoma. Rather, elevation of homocysteine in the retina marks dysfunction of one-carbon metabolism and the interaction of its vitamin cofactors and precursors B6, B9, B12, and choline. Supplementation of these provides robust neuroprotection with strong potential for translation to glaucoma patients,"" wrote the authors.

This network, responsible for regulating attention and switching between mental states, was found to be consistently larger in people with depression, regardless of symptom severity or treatment history.

Crucially, the expansion appears to predate the onset of symptoms, offering hope for early identification and intervention.

Distinctive Brain Connectivity Pattern Identified

The salience network, a neural system responsible for attention allocation and switching between different brain networks, appears to be functionally twice as large in people with depression as in those without the condition.

This finding, highlighted in the commentary by researchers at the University of Ottawa and the University of California San Francisco, builds upon groundbreaking research published in Nature by Lynch et al.

“What makes this discovery so significant is that the expanded salience network predates the onset of depressive symptoms and remains stable regardless of symptom severity or treatment interventions,” explained Dr. Nicholas Fabiano, co-author of the commentary from the University of Ottawa’s Department of Psychiatry.

“We’re potentially looking at a distinctive neural signature that could identify individuals at risk for depression before they experience symptoms.”

This characteristic brain connectivity pattern was observed consistently across individuals with depression, suggesting its potential as a depression biomarker.

The salience network, comprising the fronto-insular cortex, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala, and temporal poles, plays a crucial role in reward processing and regulating the switch between the default mode network and frontoparietal network.

Potential for Early Identification and Intervention

Depression affects millions worldwide, yet remains poorly diagnosed and predicted despite significant advances in mental health awareness. The World Health Organization identifies depression as a leading cause of disability globally, with many cases going undiagnosed until symptoms become severe.

The commentary authors highlight how this biomarker could transform depression management.

“By identifying those at risk before they experience the full impact of depression, we can intervene earlier, leading to lasting improvements in their quality of life,” noted Katerina Palacek from the University of Ottawa’s Faculty of Medicine.

Early detection has been proven to support remission in those with depressive symptoms and decrease the likelihood of progression to treatment resistance. This could ultimately lessen the chances of relapse, shorter periods of remission, and longer depressive episodes.

What factors might trigger an expanded salience network in those predisposed to depression? Does this pattern appear in other mental health conditions with overlapping symptoms?

These questions represent important next steps for researchers in understanding the implications of this discovery.

Understanding Mechanisms Behind Network Expansion

The researchers propose three potential mechanisms underlying this salience network expansion:

Compensatory neural changes: The enlarged network could represent a compensatory response based on increased usage of this network in individuals predisposed to depression. Genetic predisposition: There may be genetic factors contributing to the development of an enlarged salience network in those who later develop depression. Relative expansion due to atrophy: The salience network might appear relatively enlarged as a consequence of atrophy in other brain regions that could predate depressive symptoms.

“While we observe similarities between regions implicated in depression-related brain atrophy and the salience network, including the insular cortex and anterior cingulate cortex, there are also notable differences,” explained Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris, co-author from the University of California San Francisco’s Weill Institute for Neurosciences.

“This suggests complex interactions between various brain networks in depression that we’re just beginning to understand.”

Reconceptualizing Depression Treatment

The findings underscore the need to reconceptualize depression as a disorder of neural connectivity rather than isolated neurotransmitter imbalances, with potential implications for developing targeted therapeutic approaches.

“Depression is not a simple disease characterized by independently functioning brain areas or isolated neurotransmitter imbalances,” noted the researchers.

“By record, it is a multifaceted condition with altered brain-wide connectivity that cannot be comprehensively understood through fragmented lenses.”

This suggests potential value in investigating how various established and novel depression treatments—including antidepressants, exercise, diet modifications, electroconvulsive therapy, ketamine, and psychedelics—might impact the salience network’s functional connectivity.

Emerging research has found these approaches implicated in central nervous system plasticity, potentially affecting brain network connectivity.

The commentary authors suggest longitudinal studies tracking how the size of the salience network evolves with different treatment modalities could provide transformative insights into whether external stimuli can modify this network and if these modifications improve depression symptoms.

The emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (H5N1) in the US has put poultry and dairy farms on high alert, resulting in culls that are devastating the industries, and fears it could transform into a human pandemic.

We've seen reports of infections in cats, but new research from the University of Maryland in the US suggests feline cases – and the risk of transmission from cats to humans – is not being taken seriously enough.

""Bird flu is very deadly to cats, and we urgently need to figure out how widespread the virus is in cat populations to better assess spillover risk to humans,"" University of Maryland airborne infectious disease researcher Kristen Coleman says.

This is particularly crucial as birds in the United States make their springtime migrations, potentially spreading the virus further afield.

""As summer approaches, we are anticipating cases on farms and in the wild to rise again,"" Coleman adds.

Coleman and her co-author, animal scientist Ian Bemis, analyzed peer-reviewed research published between 2004 and 2024, finding 607 reported cases of bird flu infection in cats globally. Across 18 countries and 12 species (ranging from house cats to zoo tigers), 302 deaths were associated with the virus.

The researchers believe that a lack of monitoring means these numbers are a serious underestimation.

They noticed that in 2023, reports of pet cat infections increased drastically. In 2023 and 2024, there was a spike in the number of pet cats infected with, and killed by, bird flu.

Most cases can be attributed to the deadliest strain of bird flu, H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b, which had a 90 percent case fatality rate within the data. However, this rate may not reflect the actual risk of death to cats if infected, since testing has been very limited.

The authors urge authorities, veterinarians, and pet owners to increase surveillance of cats.

""We want to help protect both people and pets,"" Coleman says.

There are no confirmed cases of cat-to-human transmission for this particular strain of bird flu, although in 2016, the outbreak of a different strain among cats in New York City animal shelters did result in cat-to-human transmission.

Human-to-human transmission is yet to be recorded, but researchers are concerned this ability may only be a few genetic mutations away.

Nonetheless, Coleman and Bemis note that owners of farm cats, free-roaming cats, veterinarians, zookeepers, and animal shelter volunteers may have a higher risk of exposure to bird flu through interspecies transmissions.

Hunting is in a cat's nature. A free-range cat can kill around 186 animals each year. Besides protecting wildlife and saving on vet bills, this might be another good reason to transition your beloved companion to an indoor lifestyle.

Cats become infected by hunting and eating infected wild birds and mammals, or by consuming infected raw pet food or raw cow's milk – including products sold commercially. They can also catch the virus from other mammals they live alongside, including cats in the neighborhood and, potentially, their owners.

""Our future research will involve studies to determine the prevalence of high pathogenicity avian influenza and other influenza viruses in high-risk cat populations such as dairy barn cats,"" Bemis says.

The research is published in Open Forum Infectious Diseases."|"Cats infected with bird flu are falling under the radar when it comes to tracking and managing the virus, and this must change rapidly, scientists warn in a new paper.
