When Bill and Melinda French Gates created the Gates Foundation in 2000, they had planned for the organization to continue its work, using their remaining fortune, for several decades after they died. But now, the billionaire Microsoft founder says he doesn’t want to wait that long to give away most of his wealth.

Gates announced on Thursday that he now plans to distribute “virtually all” of his wealth — around $200 billion, he estimates — within the next 20 years, before shuttering the foundation on December 31, 2045.

The announcement comes as President Donald Trump’s administration is working to slash funding for health, foreign aid and other public assistance programs — the types of causes the Gates Foundation supports — raising concerns about stalled progress on research and other crucial projects.

Gates wants to accelerate the foundation’s work on global health and equity initiatives and hopes the move will set a model for other billionaires, he said in a blog post published Thursday morning. The pledge builds on Gates’ track record of promoting philanthropy. He, along with ex-wife French Gates and Warren Buffett, launched the Giving Pledge in 2010 to encourage wealthy individuals to donate most of their fortunes to charitable causes either during their lifetimes or in their wills. It now has more than 240 signatories.

“People will say a lot of things about me when I die, but I am determined that ‘he died rich’ will not be one of them,” Gates, who turns 70 later this year, wrote. “There are too many urgent problems to solve for me to hold onto resources that could be used to help people.”

The Gates Foundation, one of the world’s largest philanthropies, has already given away more than $100 billion since its founding, including to develop new vaccines, diagnostic tools and treatment delivery mechanisms to fight disease around the world. Gates has increased the pace of his giving in recent years, especially following the pandemic, but Thursday’s announcement marks a dramatic acceleration in the mobilization of his wealth. The Gates Foundation called it the “largest philanthropic commitment in modern history.”

Over the next 20 years, the Gates Foundation will focus on three main goals: ending preventable deaths of moms and babies, eradicating deadly infectious diseases and lifting hundreds of millions of people around the world out of poverty.

In its announcement, the foundation raised concerns about what it described as stagnant global health trends. And in an interview with the Financial Times published Thursday, Gates accused fellow billionaire Elon Musk of “killing the world’s poorest children” because of his work at the Department of Government Efficiency cutting US international aid programs. In an event in New York on Thursday announcing the commitment, Gates said he met with Trump in February to express his concerns, in particular, about cuts to USAID.

During that event — attended by billionaire Mike Bloomberg, singer Jon Batiste and other philanthropic partners — Gates Foundation CEO Mark Suzman said the world is in a moment “where we are facing, literally, the toughest political and economic headwinds to our agenda since we were established.” He added that “much of (our) amazing progress is at risk.”

However, in his blog post Thursday, Gates expressed optimism that advancements in artificial intelligence, in combination with his giving, could increase the rate of progress.

Gates’ current net worth is $108 billion; Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index ranks him as the fifth wealthiest person in the world. Now, he said his net worth will fall 99% by 2045. The $200 billion he expects to give away through the foundation over the next 20 years will come from its existing $77 billion endowment and his personal wealth, including any earnings from ongoing business investments such as TerraPower, the nuclear power company he founded,

French Gates exited the Gates Foundation last year following the couple’s high-profile divorce in 2021. She said in 2022 that she would not give away the bulk of her wealth through the Gates Foundation.

The announcement comes weeks after Microsoft, now worth more than $3 trillion, marked 50 years since it was founded by Gates. “It feels right that I celebrate the milestone by committing to give away the resources I earned through the company,” he wrote.","New York CNN —When Bill and Melinda French Gates created the Gates Foundation in 2000, they had planned for the organization to continue its work, using their remaining fortune, for several decades after they died.

2025-05-08 21:07:55,2025-05-09 05:07:55 +08,https://insideevs.com/news/758570/tesla-european-sales-plummet-april-2025/,Tesla’s European Death Spiral Has No End In Sight,"Tesla sales in several European countries plummeted by over 50% in April.

The poor performance comes after a first quarter in the red and a disappointing full year in 2024.

Despite it still being one of the largest electric car makers in the world, Tesla’s grip on the market is weakening month after month. That’s especially true in Europe, where buyers have plenty of alternatives to Tesla’s aging lineup of battery-powered cars.

More and more people in Europe’s largest EV markets are ditching Teslas in favor of pretty much anything else, either because they want nothing to do with CEO Elon Musk’s antics or simply because they found a better car somewhere else.

Whatever the reason, the sales figures are disappointing, to say the least. In April, Tesla sales went down an astonishing 81% in Sweden—the lowest level since October 2022. In the Netherlands, Tesla sales decreased 73.8% compared to the same month last year. It’s the same story in Denmark and France, where the American automaker’s numbers fell by 67% and 59% respectively. In Portugal, the fall wasn’t as abrupt, but at 33%, it’s still nothing to write home about.

All of this is despite Tesla’s best efforts to rejuvenate its presence in Europe with the launch of the refreshed Model Y. The electric crossover has long been the company’s breadwinner, and has led the sales charts in Europe. But even with styling and under-the-skin upgrades courtesy of the facelift, the crossover has had a hard time recapturing Europeans’ attention.

In the first quarter of this year, all-electric car sales in the European Union went up by 23.9%. Despite this, Tesla’s sales in the region plummeted by 45% to just 36,167 units, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA). At the same time, Tesla’s market share went from 2.4% last year to 1.3% in the first quarter of this year.

In the enlarged market of the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the European Free Trade Association (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland), Tesla sales fell by 37.3% in the first quarter as overall EV sales went up 28%.

In the United States, the company had a softer fall, but a fall nonetheless. While total EV sales grew 11.4% in the first quarter, Tesla’s numbers went down 8.6%, according to data from Cox Automotive.

Tesla’s latest woes in Europe come hot on the heels of a disappointing year for the name that was once hailed as a pioneer in the EV space. Last year, Tesla posted its worst global delivery numbers in over two years, with a 13% drop year-over-year.

The big question now is: can Tesla come back from its sales slump? Judging from the hype surrounding the affordable Slate electric pickup, one would argue that what Tesla needs most right now is that long-delayed cheap EV. The company seems to have figured out so much, with a more affordable model potentially seeing the light of day next month. We still don't know what that car will be, though. One report said it could be a stripped-down, smaller Model Y, while Musk himself seems hell-bent on selling people a two-door, steering wheel-less robotaxi running unproven software.

The company said Thursday that the cost comprises $700 million in cash and 11 million shares of Coinbase class A common stock. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the year.

Shares of Coinbase rose more than 5%.

The acquisition positions Coinbase as an international leader in crypto derivatives by open interest and options volume, Greg Tusar, vice president of institutional product, said in a blog post – which could allow it take on big players like Binance. Coinbase operates the largest marketplace for buying and selling cryptocurrencies within the U.S., but has a smaller share of the global crypto market, where activity largely takes place on Binance.

Deribit facilitated more than $1 trillion in trading volume last year and has about $30 billion of current open interest on the platform.

""We're excited to join forces with Coinbase to power a new era in global crypto derivatives,"" Deribit CEO Luuk Strijers said in a statement. ""As the leading crypto options platform, we've built a strong, profitable business, and this acquisition will accelerate the foundation we laid while providing traders with even more opportunities across spot, futures, perpetuals, and options – all under one trusted brand. Together with Coinbase, we're set to shape the future of the global crypto derivatives market.""

Tusar also noted that Deribit has a ""consistent track record"" of generating positive adjusted EBITDA the company believes will grow as a combined entity.

""One of the things we liked most about this deal is that it's not just a game changer for our international expansion plans — it immediately diversifies our revenue and enhances profitability,"" Tusar told CNBC.

The deal comes at a time when the crypto industry is riding regulatory tailwinds from the first ever pro-crypto White House. Support of the industry has fueled crypto M&A activity in recent weeks. In March, crypto exchange Kraken agreed to acquire NinjaTrader for $1.5 billion, and last month Ripple agreed to buy prime broker Hidden Road.

By structuring the deal as a cash-and-stock transaction, Coinbase still should have bandwidth to make other acquisitions if there is an opportunity. As of Dec. 31, Coinbase had $8.5 billion in cash on its balance sheet.","Coinbase agreed to acquire Dubai-based Deribit, a major crypto derivatives exchange, for $2.9 billion, the largest deal in the crypto industry to date.

Last year, banks quickly raised interest rates to record levels and added new monthly fees on credit cards when a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule threatened a key revenue source for the industry.

Now, they're far more reluctant to reverse those steps, even after bank trade groups succeeded in killing the CFPB rule in federal court last month.

Synchrony and Bread Financial, two of the biggest players in the business of issuing branded credit cards for the likes of Amazon , Lowe's and Wayfair , are keeping the higher rates in place, executives said in recent conference calls.

""We feel pretty comfortable that the rule has been vacated,"" Synchrony CEO Brian Doubles said on April 22. ""With that said, we don't currently have plans to roll anything back in terms of the changes that we made.""

His counterpart at Bread, CEO Ralph Andretta, echoed that sentiment, ""At this point, we're not intending to roll back those changes, and we've talked to the partners about that.""

The CEOs celebrated the end of a proposed CFPB regulation that was meant to limit what Americans would pay in credit card late fees, an effort that the industry called a misguided and unlawful example of regulatory overreach. Under previous Director Rohit Chopra, the CFPB estimated that its rule would save families $10 billion annually. Instead, it inadvertently saddled borrowers with higher rates and fees for receiving paper statements as credit card companies sought to offset the expected revenue hit.

Retail cards hit a record high average interest rate of 30.5% last year, according to a Bankrate survey, and rates have stayed close to those levels this year.

""The companies have made a windfall,"" said David Silberman, a veteran banking attorney who lectures at Yale Law School. ""They didn't think they needed this revenue before except for [the CFPB rule], and they're now keeping it, which is coming directly out of the consumer's pocket.""

Synchrony and Bread both easily topped expectations for first-quarter profit, and analysts covering the companies have raised estimates for what they will earn this year, despite concerns about a looming U.S. economic slowdown.","Last year, banks quickly raised interest rates to record levels and added new monthly fees on credit cards when a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule threatened a key revenue source for the industry.

Saudi Arabia is deepening its investment in women's professional golf.

The Public Investment Fund, the sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia, announced on Wednesday that it will become the title partner of five events that will take place on the the Ladies European Tour.

Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

As part of this latest deal, the tour will revamp the five events, which will be collectively rebranded as the PIF Global Series. The events take place in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; Seoul, South Korea; London; Houston; and Shenzhen, China.

""PIF continues to be a catalyst for the growth of women's sports, committed to delivering long-term transformative impact by inspiring and empowering female athletes at every level,"" Alanoud Althonayan, head of events and sponsorships at PIF, said in a statement.

The revamped tournament format will feature team and individual competitions happening simultaneously.

The Saudis are also injecting additional money into the prize pools, with a collective purse of $13 million across the five events.

Alexandra Armas, CEO of the Ladies European Tour, said the partnership with PIF has helped raise the level of competition in the women's game and gives players more opportunities to succeed on the world stage.

Saudi Arabia has been aggressively investing in professional sports in recent years as part of its vision to diversify the country's economy away from oil. Despite the fact that Saudi Arabia has been slow to give Saudi women rights, those investments have included spending big money on international women's sports.

Last May, the fund signed a multi-year partnership with the WTA Tour, the women's professional tennis organization, to grow the game and improve women's benefits in the league.

And in March, PIF announced it will fully fund the tour's maternity fund, which would allow women to take up to a year of leave fully paid.

However, PIF's foray into men's golf has been more complicated.

Nearly two years ago, PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan and PIF Governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan appeared on CNBC, announcing a merger between LIV Golf and the PGA Tour. But that deal has yet to happen, despite the latest push by President Donald Trump to bring the two parties together.

Britain is holding its breath as it waits on the result of trade negotiations between the UK and the US.

The UK is expected to become the first country to make a new deal with the United States following President Donald Trump’s far-reaching tariffs last month.

‌



The UK, like the rest of the world, has a base level 10% on all imports, while a number of industry-specific barriers – such as on the car industry – have also been erected.

‌



Latest reports claim a deal has been done, and an announcement is expected at 3pm today (May 8).

Last night, Trump posted on his Truth Social platform: “Big News Conference tomorrow morning at 10:00 A.M., The Oval Office, concerning a MAJOR TRADE DEAL WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF A BIG, AND HIGHLY RESPECTED, COUNTRY. THE FIRST OF MANY!!!”

But what a trade deal could include with the US remains to be seen.

It’s no secret that the UK needs the US in various ways, with a Number 10 spokesperson admitting ahead of the announcement that, “The United States is an indispensable ally for both our economic and national security”.

This then, naturally creates fear Britain could sell out its own preferences in the interest of getting a deal done.

‌



But what does a good deal look like, and what is a worst case scenario?

“The context of this is that Trump has introduced a number of new tariff over the last few months and so the UK is trying to negotiate those tariffs off, said Marley Morris of the Institute for Public Policy Research.

“So, to some extent, we’re trying to get back to where we were before.

‌



“Best case scenario is a removal of all those tariffs, steel, aluminium, cars and the universal baseline tariffs.

Chlorinated chicken has long been a sticking point (stock) (Image: Bloomberg via Getty Images )

“Going even further, trade integration. I think that’s unlikely, I think what we’ll see is steel and aluminium tariffs going out of the talks and it looks like Trump is pretty insistent on maintaining the universal baseline tariffs for everyone. So the talks are likely to focus more on the steel and car tariffs.”

‌



He then laid out what a poor outcome could look like, with things like food and online security potentially on the line.

Morris added: “Worst case scenario would be even those tariffs weren’t removed very much or only reduced slightly.

“And then of course the other question will be what is the UK offering in terms of the negotiations.

‌



“I think we’re expecting something on the digital services tax being reduced, but I think from our perspective a worst case scenario would be the UK crossing red lines.

“For instance compromising our online safety rules or our food safety standards – for instance things like chlorinated chicken or hormone-treated beef. I think that’s unlikely because the government said it has those red lines.

“But I think that’s the worst case scenario – the government compromising those things while going beyond where it originally suggested it would and didn't get much in return.

‌



Trump said the deal was comprehensive (Image: AFP via Getty Images )

“But, I think more likely, we’ll get somewhere in between. I think we’ll probably be sensible, which reduces tariffs on cars and steel and has some compromises on the UK side, for instance lowering the digital services tax.”

Presumably with these fears in mind, MPs have been calling on the government to open any deal to a vote in the commons.

‌



Daisy Cooper, the MP for St Albans, said in a statement: “Parliament must be given a vote on this US trade deal so it can be properly scrutinised.

A good trade deal with the US could bring huge benefits, but Liberal Democrats are deeply concerned that it may include measures that threaten our NHS, undermine our farmers or give tax cuts to US tech billionaires.

If the government is confident the agreement it has negotiated with Trump is in Britain’s national interest, it should not be afraid to bring it before MPs.

The Walt Disney Co. announced Wednesday that it has reached an agreement with immersive destination and experiences company Miral to bring a park and resort to Yas Island in the United Arab Emirates.

This will be Disney's seventh theme park resort and it will be fully developed and built by Miral. Disney's imagineers will lead creative design and operational oversight on the project. The entertainment giant will not be investing capital in the project, but will reap the benefits of royalties.

The development in Abu Dhabi is not part of the $60 billion that Disney has pledged to invest in its theme parks over the next decade.

""This is a thrilling moment for our company as we announce plans to build an exciting Disney theme park resort in Abu Dhabi, whose culture is rich with an appreciation of the arts and creativity,"" said Disney CEO Bob Iger, in a statement. ""As our seventh theme park destination, it will rise from this land in spectacular fashion, blending contemporary architecture with cutting edge technology to offer guests deeply immersive entertainment experiences in unique and modern ways.""

Iger, in an interview with CNBC's David Faber on Wednesday, said imagineers have already begun designing the park. He declined to specify when the company expects the park to open.

""We're not pinning down a date yet,"" he said. ""It typically takes us between 18 months and two years to design and fully develop and approximately five years to build but we're not making any commitments right now.""

The announcement came after Disney reported a top- and bottom-line beat for its fiscal second quarter, with its experiences business — including parks, cruises and resorts as well as consumer products — reporting 6% year-over-year revenue growth.

The segment represented 37% of the company's overall revenue in fiscal 2024 and nearly 60% of its operating income.

""Experiences is obviously a critical business for Disney and also an important growth platform,"" Iger said on Disney's second-quarter earnings conference call. ""Despite questions around any macroeconomic uncertainty or the impact of competition, I'm encouraged by the strength and resilience of our business as evidenced in these earnings and in the second-half bookings at Walt Disney World.""","A new Disney theme park is coming to Abu Dhabi.

The vehicle program is in crisis.

We reported at the beginning of April that Tesla ended the first quarter of 2025 with at least 2,400 Cybertrucks in new inventory available in the US.

There’s no exact way to track Tesla’s inventory in the US, but there are ways to track Tesla’s Cybertruck listings. Sometimes, Tesla may have many vehicles with the exact same configuration at the same location and it will only publish a single listing for it.

Therefore, Tesla might have been sitting on more Cybertruck inventory.

Advertisement - scroll for more content

A month later, the number of listings in the US has skyrocketed to over 10,000 Cybertrucks, according to Tesla-Info.com:

This surge could be due to an actual net increase in Cybertruck inventory, but Tesla is also heavily discounting the trucks at varying rates, creating several different prices and, therefore, more listings.

At an average sale price of $78,000, Tesla could have almost $800 million worth of Cybertrucks.

Due to low demand, Tesla appears to have significantly slowed down Cybertruck production in recent months. Therefore, this surge is likely more about Tesla discounting the vehicles, exposing the broader US inventory, than an actual major increase in inventory due to more production.

Many of the Cybertrucks in inventory were built in 2024, so they are already at least four months old. Tesla still has ‘Foundation Series’ Cybertrucks in inventory, which it stopped producing in October 2024—more than seven months ago.

Tesla recently launched the Cybertruck RWD, but it has given up on making it with a smaller battery pack and instead removed many important features.

Electrek’s Take

This is about as bad as it gets. Over 10,000 units account for about two quarters of Tesla’s Cybertruck sales.

It already looks like Tesla has slowed Cybertruck production down to a crawl, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it pauses it soon. The hard part for Tesla is to admit defeat.

The Cybertruck RWD using the same battery pack as the AWD was already a sort of admission that Tesla found the vehicle program to be too small to be worth being produced with two battery pack sizes. The automaker did the same with Model S/X when the program’s volumes shrank following the launches of Model 3 and Model Y.

It looks like under the current circumstances, Tesla will have issues selling more than 20,000 Cybertrucks per year in the US despite having planned production for 250,000 units.","Tesla’s Cybertruck inventory has skyrocketed to a new record high of more than 10,000 units.
There’s no exact way to track Tesla’s inventory in the US, but there are ways to track Tesla’s Cybertruck listings.
Therefore, Tesla might have been sitting on more Cybertruck inventory.

The economy could face a no-win dilemma,"The Federal Reserve is holding interest rates steady as it navigates uncertainty kicked up by a president who keeps haranguing the central bank to lower them.

“‘Too Late’ Jerome Powell is a FOOL, who doesn’t have a clue,” President Donald Trump posted on his Truth Social platform Friday morning, renewing a long-running barrage of insults against the central bank chair. “Other than that, I like him very much!” he added.

The president’s public pressure campaign on the Fed comes as the central bank faces an ironic, whiplash-inducing reversal.

Just months ago, it was on the verge of a rare feat — wrestling down a historic run-up of inflation without triggering mass layoffs, known as a “soft landing” — and preparing to keep cutting borrowing costs. But Trump’s rapid upending of global trade has pushed the Fed and its leader into a difficult position, in which they feel a wait-and-see approach may be their best strategy for now.

“The Fed has been plunged into an almost impossible situation whereby its two mandates will likely move in opposite directions,” said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, referring to the Fed’s dual mission of keeping employment high and inflation low.

“But government policy — which is incredibly uncertain itself — will dictate both the timing and magnitudes of those moves,” she wrote in a note to clients Wednesday.

The concern is that an economy damaged by tariffs will force the Fed to cut interest rates to stave off job losses, at the risk of driving inflation higher. After having peaked above 9% in mid-2022, the annual inflation rate has been hovering just north of the central bank’s 2% target for nearly a year.

Powell said Wednesday that holding pat on rates allows the Fed to “wait and see” how the economy unfolds. But policymakers warned in their statement Wednesday that “the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen,” renewing concerns about “stagflation” — a situation in which job losses and price hikes both mount even as the economy lags.

“The tariff shock will reduce real GDP growth and raise prices at the same time, putting the Fed on the horns of a dilemma,” Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings, warned in a note Wednesday afternoon. “The policy move necessary to maintain full employment is the opposite of that necessary to contain inflation. Moving one policy lever to hit two conflicting targets is problematic.”

Politics are adding to the difficulty. Trump has broken long-standing norms against political influence over monetary policy by repeatedly bashing Powell, whom he appointed in 2018. The president’s fresh criticism Friday follows weeks of escalating attacks.

“CUT INTEREST RATES, JEROME, AND STOP PLAYING POLITICS!” he wrote on Truth Social on April 4. Two weeks later, he posted again, nicknaming Powell “Too Late” and saying his “termination cannot come fast enough!” In yet another post a week later, Trump called Powell a “major loser.”

Powell told reporters Wednesday that Trump’s comments had no impact.

“It really doesn’t affect either our job or the way we do it,” he said, adding that neither has he asked for a meeting with Trump nor has the president requested one. President Joe Biden reappointed Powell in 2022, and despite the recent barrage of criticism, Trump told NBC News’ Kristen Welker last week that he wouldn’t seek to remove him before his term ends in May 2026.

“Why would I do that? I get to replace the person in another short period of time,” he said.

The challenges of recent months mark the second time Powell has weighed how to handle economic fallout from Trump’s trade policies. In 2019, Trump was similarly threatening higher duties on China. Powell, who faced similar jabs from Trump through a barrage of Twitter posts at the time, wound up cutting interest rates three times to pre-emptively cushion the U.S. economy from the blow of higher duties.

Powell signaled Wednesday that this time is different. The Fed was less worried in 2019 about the inflationary impacts of lower rates, he indicated, because prices were rising more slowly at a slower pace than they are now. Core personal consumption expenditures, the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, showed prices rising at an annual rate of 2.6% in March, whereas the same measure clocked in beneath 2% for all of 2019.

“It’s not a situation where we can be pre-emptive, because we actually don’t know what the right response to the data will be until we see more data,” Powell said.

Although markets expect the Fed to cut interest rates three times by the end of the year, some analysts aren’t so sure. Bank of America researchers said Wednesday, “If our base case of a steady labor market and rising inflation is correct, we don’t see a path to cuts in 2025.”

In the meantime, Powell has avoided committing to future moves given the widespread uncertainty Trump’s tariffs have generated for corporate bosses, small-business owners and consumers alike.

“There are cases in which it would be appropriate for us to cut rates this year. There are cases in which it wouldn’t,” he told reporters Wednesday. “We just don’t know.”","The Federal Reserve is holding interest rates steady as it navigates uncertainty kicked up by a president who keeps haranguing the central bank to lower them.

The change in the deficit was influenced by the timing of outlays, which decreased the deficit during the first seven months of fiscal year 2024. Outlays in fiscal year 2024 were reduced by shifts in the timing of payments that were due on October 1, 2023, a Sunday. (The payments were made that September.) If not for those shifts, the deficit so far this fiscal year would have been $123 billion more than the shortfall at this point last year.

Economic data releases and earnings

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell offered investors a consistent message on Wednesday: patience.

Time and again, the chair came back to the idea that the Fed has an ability, and an obligation, to wait and see how developments evolve on tariff policy and any economic distortions that follow.

The first distortion, as the Fed noted in its policy statement, came from export data that dragged down first quarter GDP. Powell also noted survey data reflects considerable uncertainty among businesses and households. And ongoing trade negotiations make the outlook hard to peg too.

""For the time being, we're well-positioned to wait for greater clarity before considering any adjustments to our policy stance,"" Powell said in prepared remarks Wednesday. And as the Fed chair's Q&A evolved, the theme recurred.

But what began as an insistence toward patience eventually announced itself as the outlines of a plan, in the end, not to be preemptive but reactive. Specifically, the central bank will wait and see if things get worse in the US economy. And only then will it be compelled to move.

Back in 2019, Powell noted the economy showed some signs of weakening and, with inflation running below the Fed's 2% target, the central bank cut rates three times to stave off a further slowdown. Before the pandemic rocked the global economy, the Fed and markets enjoyed what some called one of the ""easiest years ever for investors.""

In 2025, the central bank is in no such situation.

Today, inflation is running above the Fed's 2% target. The prospect of tariffs likely lifts inflation — even if temporarily — further away from that goal. Powell also acknowledged that some are making forecasts for a weakening economy, even a recession.

""My gut tells me that uncertainty about the path of the economy is extremely elevated, and that the downside risks have increased,"" Powell said during his press conference.

In its policy statement, the central bank noted that since March, ""Uncertainty about the economic outlook has increased further."" It added, ""The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen.""

Still, attentiveness does not create an ability to anticipate.

""In any case, [the current economy is] not a situation where we can be preemptive because we actually don't know what the right response to the data will be until we see more data,"" Powell said.","The first distortion, as the Fed noted in its policy statement, came from export data that dragged down first quarter GDP.

Keir Starmer signed off the deal after a week of intensive talks by officials in Washington

The US trade deal may not be as “full and comprehensive” as Donald Trump said on Truth Social last night – but Keir Starmer looks to have secured a solid agreement for Britain.

The UK and US have agreed terms on a landmark deal which could save British jobs, The i Paper revealed earlier today.

Trade experts will now pore over the details.

The Prime Minister signed off the deal late on Wednesday after a week of intensive talks between negotiators concluded in Washington DC.

The terms were announced by the US President at 3pm UK time, and will see an end to the 25 per cent tariff on steel and cars. It is a boost to the UK auto industry, which was worth about £9bn last year.

Car export tariffs will reduce from 27.5 per cent to 10 per cent, for a quota of 100,000 UK cars, almost the total the UK exported last year, while steel tariffs will be reduced to zero.

Negotiations on reducing the US-imposed 10 per cent tariffs across all sectors are expected to be continued in the near future.

And the UK will not lower its 2 per cent digital services tax on US firms owned by billionaires like Trump aide Elon Musk – in another win for Starmer.

British farmers are likely to be pleased by the fact that there has been no UK concession on food standards imported from the US in the deal – but there may still be jitters over what the future holds.

Many American farmers use growth hormones as a standard part of their beef production, something that was banned in Britain and the EU in the 1980s.

But there will only be reciprocal arrangements on high-quality beef, The i Paper understands, and no concessions at all on sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) arrangements such as the import of chlorinated chickens.

The US said Britain has agreed to take agricultural machinery and products to put £5bn into UK markets.

The UK is also understood to have had assurances of preferential treatment on pharmaceutical exports although the US has not imposed tariffs on drugs yet.

The UK’s second-largest export to the US is pharmaceuticals, with sales reaching £6.6bn last year.

Trump said in a post on Truth Social: “This should be a very big and exciting day” for the US and UK.

He also said that the deal was “full and comprehensive,” and would “cement the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom for many years to come”.

But this isn’t a major trade deal because the US President does not have the authority to sign off on the type of free-trade agreement which India and the UK finalised earlier this week.

That power lies with Congress which would need to approve a trade agreement, which would take longer than the 90-day pause in place on Trump’s tariffs.","The UK and US have agreed terms on a landmark deal which could save British jobs, The i Paper revealed earlier today.

The White House is due to hold a news conference at 10:00 a.m. ET (3 p.m. London time) on Thursday in the Oval Office.

In a post on Truth Social, U.S. President Donald Trump said Thursday, ""The agreement with the United Kingdom is a full and comprehensive one that will cement the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom for many years to come.""

""Because of our long time history and allegiance together, it is a great honor to have the United Kingdom as our FIRST announcement. Many other deals, which are in serious stages of negotiation, to follow!""

A spokesperson for the office of U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer told CNBC: ""The United States is an indispensable ally for both our economic and national security. Talks on a deal between our countries have been continuing at pace and the Prime Minister will update later today.""

The New York Times first reported that a U.K.-U.S. announcement would be made on Thursday.



Britain, which runs a trade deficit with the U.S., was spared the higher reciprocal tariffs when Trump announced his ""liberation day"" duties, although it was still hit with the baseline 10% levy. It is also subject to the U.S.' 25% duties on steel, aluminum and vehicles, which early reports suggest may play a key role in the deal to be announced Thursday.

The U.K.'s central bank cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point on Thursday. The Bank of England said in a statement that global growth prospects had weakened as a result of tariff uncertainty and announcements, but added that negative impacts on U.K. growth and inflation were ""likely to be smaller.""

The decision came after the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday held rates steady, noting that risks to both higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump agreed Thursday to cut tariffs on U.K. autos, steel and aluminum in a planned trade deal but played down the possibility of other nations getting similarly favorable terms on his import taxes, which are roiling the global economy.

Under the framework agreement, the United Kingdom is to buy more American beef and ethanol and streamline its customs process for goods from the United States. But Trump’s baseline 10% tariffs against British goods are to stay in place, and the Republican president suggested that even higher import taxes would be charged on other countries trying to reach deals with the U.S.

“That’s a low number,” Trump said of the U.K.'s 10% tariff rate, adding that other countries would face higher tariff rates in their deals because the U.S. runs trade deficits with them and “in many cases they didn’t treat us right.”

The announcement provided a political victory for U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and offered a degree of validation for Trump’s claims that his turbulent approach on trade may be able to rebalance the global economy on his preferred terms. While the deal should improve Britain’s situation relative to when Trump began imposing new tariffs, the world economy is still mired in the confusion and uncertainty unleashed by the president’s import taxes. The deal with the U.K. would be a resonant but small step toward greater clarity given that Britain represents a fraction of U.S. imports.

The U.S. president talked up the framework to reporters in the Oval Office, although the fine print remains in flux.

“In the coming weeks, we’ll have it all very conclusive,” Trump said.

The president said the agreement would lead to more beef and ethanol exports to the U.K., and streamline the processing of U.S. goods through customs. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the baseline 10% tariffs would stay in place and said an unspecified British company would be announcing the purchase of $10 billion in aircraft from Boeing.

Cars, steel and olive oil

U.K. officials said Trump’s auto tariffs would go from 27.5% to 10% on a quota of 100,000 vehicles and the import taxes on steel and aluminum would go from 25% to zero. Starmer said Britain would preserve its health and safety standards on food products.

The U.K. government also said it would also reduce tariffs on 2,500 U.S. products such as olive oil, wine and sports equipment, bringing down the average tariff rate 1.8%.

Starmer, speaking over the phone to Trump while reporters listened in, stressed the importance of the relationship between the two countries as the anniversary of the Allies’ World War II victory in Europe was being commemorated.

“To be able to announce this great deal, on the same day 80 years forward, almost at the same hour,” Starmer said, “I think is incredibly important and makes this truly historic.”

Starmer later spoke to workers at a Jaguar Land Rover plant and promoted the deal, which he said would protect thousands of auto jobs. He told the workers that “this is just the start,” saying “we are hammering out further details to reduce barriers to trade with the United States and across the world.”

While celebrating the planned deal, Trump talked up the U.S. economy’s future despite worrisome signs of a possible slowdown and increase in inflation that could hurt most Americans’ financial well-being and lead to layoffs.

The president said the public should buy into the stock market because the U.S. was about to go up like a “rocket ship,” even as he dismissed reports of fewer container ships docking in the U.S. and companies warning of price increases if the tariffs remain.

Trump said that fewer container ships arriving from China meant “we lose less money” from the trade deficit, even though the goods in those ships are used by U.S. manufacturers and sold by retailers in ways that can support jobs while holding down prices.

Asked about companies saying they would need to raise prices because of the tariffs, Trump said, “I think they’re saying that just to try and negotiate deals with me.” Trump suggested that he might put 100% tariffs on Mattel toys if they don’t relocate their factories to the United States.

Trump has maintained that there is “virtually” no inflation. The Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure has increased at 2.3% annually, slightly higher than the central bank’s 2% target.

The U.S. president on Thursday said that Fed Chair Jerome Powell should cut the Fed’s benchmark interest rates that are designed to manage inflation, saying that Powell was holding the Fed’s rates at current levels instead of slashing them because “he’s not in love with me.” Powell warned at a Wednesday news conference that the tariffs were creating uncertainty and the Fed could afford to wait until more data shows the impacts on the economy.

Looking for a deal since Brexit

The U.S. already runs a trade surplus with the U.K., making it a bit easier to find common ground at a time when Trump has staked his tariffs on eliminating the annual trade deficits with multiple nations he says have taken advantage of the U.S.

A British government official, insisting on anonymity to discuss the talks, said the U.K. planned to seek greater trade liberalization as negotiations continue, such that the effective tariff rate charged by the U.S. could be lower than the 10% baseline.

The official said the talks have been built on the longstanding closeness between the two nations and, when in discussions with the Trump administration, the key was to be charming and know how to say “no” nicely.

The official said Trump had invited the British government to agree to a trade deal before April 2, but the president changed his mind so that he could impose his sweeping “Liberation Day” tariffs. That statement indicates that Trump could have announced some form of Thursday’s agreement weeks earlier.

No new deals have been reached with the United States’ largest trading partners, including Canada, Mexico and China. Trump has left the highest tariffs in place on China, sparking a confrontation between the world’s two biggest economies. Washington and Beijing are sending officials to Switzerland this weekend for an initial round of trade talks.

Trump said Thursday that he “could” lower the 145% rate charged on Chinese goods if the weekend talks go well.

“Right now, you can’t get any higher,” Trump said. “It’s at 145, so we know it’s coming down.”

The U.S. and the U.K. have been aiming to strike a bilateral trade agreement since the British people voted in 2016 to leave the European Union, allowing the country to negotiate independently of the rest of the continent. Then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson touted a future deal with the U.S. as an incentive for Brexit.

Negotiations started in 2020, during Trump’s first term. But the talks made little progress under President Joe Biden, a Democrat and a critic of Brexit. Negotiations resumed after Trump returned to office in January and intensified in recent weeks.

The U.S. ran a $11.9 billion trade surplus in goods with the U.K. last year, according to the Census Bureau. The $68 billion in goods that the U.S. imported from the U.K. last year accounted for just 2% of all goods imported into the country.

The U.S. is far more important for the U.K. economy. It was Britain’s biggest trading partner last year, according to government statistics, though the bulk of Britain’s exports to the U.S. are services rather than goods.

2025-05-08 23:11:40,2025-05-09 07:11:40 +08,https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250416889571/en/Bankruptcy-Inquiries-Hit-Pandemic-Era-Highs-Warning-of-Summer-Surge,"Bankruptcy Inquiries Hit Pandemic-Era Highs, Warning of Summer Surge","ADA, Okla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Bankruptcy inquiries surged in the first quarter to their highest level since early 2020, signaling a potential summer wave of filings, LegalShield reported today. The legal service provider's data, historically a leading indicator of bankruptcy and other consumer financial trends, suggests record consumer debt and new tariffs could push financially strained households past their breaking point.

""Bankruptcy inquiries hit the highest we've seen since early 2020, just before Americans' checkbooks were boosted by COVID checks from the government,"" said Matt Layton, LegalShield senior vice president of consumer analytics. ""When you combine record debt, rising delinquencies, and prolonged financial stress, topped by price pressures driven by tariff uncertainty, the risk of a summer surge in bankruptcy filings becomes very real.""

Historically LegalShield’s Bankruptcy Index is a leading indicator of actual bankruptcy filings by two quarters.

The bankruptcy warning signs come amid a third straight quarter of elevated consumer stress measured by LegalShield’s Consumer Stress Legal Index (CSLI), pointing to a heightened financial strain that has become a ""new normal"" for American households.

The CSLI has remained elevated since a spike in July of 2024, leveling off slightly to close Q1 2025 at 65.3, down from 67.3 at the end of 2024. The decline was driven by a significant drop in consumer finance inquiries amidst tax refund season and relatively strong employment numbers, which may be masking greater concerns as bankruptcy and foreclosure inquiries increased before tariff announcements sent the markets into turmoil.

Why it matters: The CSLI, based on over 35 million legal service requests from LegalShield members, offers a unique, real-time view into American households’ financial well-being.

Many American households may be poised for a breaking point in the first half of 2025 as they deal with new tariffs, rising prices, increased debt and sustained elevated interest rates. U.S. bankruptcy filings surged 14.2% year-over-year by the end of 2024, according to the U.S. Courts, and LegalShield data indicates filings may continue to rise.

Key Findings:

1. Bankruptcy Risk Rising Quickly

Index: 36.4 (up from 33.3 in Q4; 30.0 in Q1 2024)

Insight: Consumers are buried by record debt. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported that the share of households 90+ days late on credit cards and car loans hit a 14-year high at the end of 2024, and delinquencies are still climbing. Credit card balances hit a record high of $1.21 trillion.

2. Mortgage Pressure Intensifying

Foreclosure Index: 41.3 (up from 40.1 in Q4; 36.2 in Q1 2024)

Insight: Elevated mortgage rates and affordability constraints are stressing homeowners and freezing inventory.

3. Consumer Finance Concerns Ease—For Now

Consumer Finance Index: 97.9 (down from 108.5 in Q4; 99.7 in Q1 2024)

Insight: Tax refunds and strong job growth gave consumers a temporary cushion—but risks remain as tariff-driven price increases are expected.

4. Housing Market Signals Softness

Housing Construction Index: 114.1 (down from 118.4 in Q4; 115.3 YoY)

(down from 118.4 in Q4; 115.3 YoY) Housing Sales Index: 94.1 (down from 97.9 in Q4; slightly up from 92.3 YoY)

Insight: Higher material costs driven by tariffs and elevated mortgage rates are dampening both buyer interest and builder activity. Housing starts are a leading indicator of broader economic activity. Reduced residential construction not only limits future housing supply, putting upward pressure on home prices, but also weakens associated industries like construction materials, labor markets, and durable goods.

What is the CSLI: The CSLI tracks approximately 150,000 calls per month from everyday Americans seeking legal help, comprising a dataset of more than 35 million consumer requests since 2002. The index is built on three subindices tracking calls for legal assistance for issues related to Bankruptcy, Foreclosure and Consumer Finance, which measures inquiries regarding a variety of consumer financial concerns such as billing disputes, debt issues and loan modifications.

(All quarterly percent changes in this release are seasonally adjusted annualized rates.) This is the first decline in nonfarm business sector labor productivity since the second quarter of 2022. From the same quarter a year ago, nonfarm business sector labor productivity increased 1.4 percent in the first quarter of 2025. (See tables A1 and 2.) Unit labor costs in the nonfarm business sector increased 5.7 percent in the first quarter of 2025, reflecting a 4.8-percent increase in hourly compensation and a 0.8-percent decrease in productivity. Unit labor costs increased 1.3 percent over the last four quarters. (See tables A1 and 2.) BLS calculates unit labor costs as the ratio of hourly compensation to labor productivity. Increases in hourly compensation tend to increase unit labor costs and increases in productivity tend to reduce them. Real hourly compensation, which takes into account consumer prices, increased 1.0 percent in the first quarter of 2025, and was unchanged over the last four quarters. Labor productivity, or output per hour, is calculated by dividing an index of real output by an index of hours worked by all workers, including employees, proprietors, and unpaid family workers. During the current business cycle, starting in the fourth quarter of 2019, labor productivity has grown at an annualized rate of 1.8 percent, reflecting a 2.4-percent rate of growth in output and a 0.6-percent rate of growth in hours worked. The 1.8-percent annualized rate of productivity growth in the current business cycle thus far is higher than the 1.5-percent rate of the previous business cycle from the fourth quarter of 2007 through the fourth quarter of 2019, and is below the long-term rate of 2.1 percent since the first quarter of 1947. Manufacturing sector labor productivity increased 4.5 percent in the first quarter of 2025, as output increased 5.1 percent and hours worked increased 0.5 percent. The increase in productivity is the steepest since the second quarter of 2021, when the measure increased 5.3 percent. In the durable manufacturing sector, productivity increased 7.1 percent, reflecting a 7.9-percent increase in output and a 0.8-percent increase in hours worked. Nondurable manufacturing sector productivity increased 2.2 percent, as output increased 2.3 percent and hours worked increased 0.1 percent. Total manufacturing sector productivity increased 1.5 percent from the same quarter a year ago. (See tables A1, 3, 4, and 5.) Unit labor costs in the total manufacturing sector increased 1.6 percent in the first quarter of 2025, reflecting a 6.2-percent increase in hourly compensation and a 4.5-percent increase in productivity. Manufacturing unit labor costs increased 0.7 percent from the same quarter a year ago. (See tables A1 and 3.) Manufacturing sector labor productivity has grown at an annualized rate of 0.5 percent during the current business cycle, as output has increased 0.2 percent and hours have declined 0.3 percent. The 0.5- percent annualized rate of productivity growth in the current business cycle thus far is above the 0.1- percent rate of the previous business cycle from the fourth quarter of 2007 through the fourth quarter of 2019 and is below the long-term rate of 2.1 percent since the first quarter of 1987. The 4.5 percent increase in labor productivity in the first quarter of 2025 boosted the annualized growth rate for the current business cycle 0.2 percentage point, from 0.3 percent to 0.5 percent. The concepts, sources, and methods used for the manufacturing output series differ from those used in the business and nonfarm business output series; these output measures are not directly comparable. See the Technical Notes for a more detailed explanation. Preliminary fourth-quarter and annual 2024 measures were announced today for the nonfinancial corporate sector. Productivity increased 4.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2024, as output increased 5.4 percent and hours worked increased 0.4 percent. From the fourth quarter of 2023 to the fourth quarter of 2024, nonfinancial corporate sector productivity increased 3.7 percent. Revised measures Hours and related measures--including labor productivity and hourly compensation--for all sectors were revised to incorporate updated ratios of hours worked to hours paid by detailed industry, provided by the BLS National Compensation Survey; indexes were subject to revision back to 2018. Measures of real hourly compensation for all sectors were also subject to revision from 2020 onward due to the incorporation of the revised Consumer Price Index Retroactive Series. Fourth quarter and annual average data for 2024 were revised to incorporate regular updates of source data on output and compensation published by the Department of Commerce on March 27, 2025. Manufacturing sector output for the third and fourth quarters of 2024 reflects revisions published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System on March 18 and April 16, 2025. Table B1 presents previous and revised productivity and related measures for the business, nonfarm business, and manufacturing sectors for the fourth quarter of 2024. In the fourth quarter of 2024, nonfarm business sector productivity was revised up 0.2 percentage point to an increase of 1.7 percent, reflecting a 0.1-percentage point upward revision to output; hours worked were not revised. Nonfarm business unit labor costs were revised down 0.2 percentage point to an increase of 2.0 percent, reflecting a 0.1-percentage point downward revision to hourly compensation and the aforementioned 0.2-percentage point upward revision to labor productivity. In the manufacturing sector, productivity, output, and hours worked for the fourth quarter of 2024 were not revised. Unit labor costs were revised up 0.1 percentage point to an increase of 3.8 percent. Although many measures were not revised for the manufacturing sector, the constituent durable and nondurable manufacturing sectors saw offsetting revisions. Labor productivity was revised down 0.6 percentage point in the durable manufacturing sector and up 0.6 percentage point in the nondurable manufacturing sector. Output was revised down 0.4 percentage point in the durable manufacturing sector and up 0.5 percentage point in the nondurable manufacturing sector. Hours worked were revised up 0.1 percentage point in the durable manufacturing sector and down 0.1 percentage point in the nondurable manufacturing sector. Lastly, unit labor costs were revised up 0.7 percentage point in the durable manufacturing sector and down 0.6 percentage point in the nondurable manufacturing sector (See table B1.) The annual average rate of productivity growth in the nonfarm business sector in 2024 was revised up 0.1-percentage point to an increase of 2.8 percent; annual average productivity for the manufacturing sector was not revised. (See tables 2 and 3.) Quarterly and annual data for all sectors from 2023 forward appear in tables 1-6.

Ukraine is considering moving away from the U.S. dollar and closer to the euro as a benchmark for the hryvnia, Reuters reported on May 7, citing National Bank Governor Andrii Pyshnyi.

Threats of wide-ranging tariffs by U.S. President Donald Trump have shocked markets and drawn criticism worldwide. Meanwhile, Ukraine is moving closer to the EU as it undergoes accession negotiations with the bloc.

The ""strengthening of the EU's role in ensuring our defense capabilities, greater volatility in global markets, and the probability of global trade fragmentation,"" are all reasons Ukraine is considering the euro over the dollar, Pyshnyi said.

Some European countries that do not use the euro, including Denmark, peg their currencies to the euro using the European exchange rate mechanism as part of the EU's Economic and Monetary Union.

""This work is complex and requires high-quality, versatile preparation,"" Pyshnyi told Reuters.

On April 9, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Ukraine has fulfilled 81% of its commitments made under the Association Agreement with the European Union.

""Once again, we are demonstrating that we are able to make our way to EU membership quickly and efficiently. This year, we aim to open all six clusters in the EU accession negotiations and deepen sectoral integration,"" he said.

The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on Wednesday, just weeks after President Donald Trump intensified calls for lower borrowing costs and voiced eagerness about the potential ""termination"" of Fed Chair Jerome Powell.

In recent days, Trump has dialed back his attacks on Powell, saying he will not fire Powell before the end of the top central banker's term next year. Trump has reiterated his displeasure with the level of interest rates, however, urging the central bank to lower them.

Speaking at a press conference in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, Powell said the economy remains in ""solid shape"" but warned Trump's tariff policy could cause higher inflation and an economic slowdown.

""If the large increase in tariffs that have been announced are sustained, they're likely to generate a rise in inflation and a slowdown of economic growth,"" Powell said Wednesday.

""All of these policies are evolving, however, and their effects on the economy remain highly uncertain,"" Powell added.

When asked about Trump's call for lower rates, Powell shrugged off criticism from the president.

""It doesn’t affect our doing our job at all,"" Powell said. ""We’re always going to consider only the economic data, the outlook, the balance of risks – and that’s it.""

The move marked the Fed's second consecutive decision to maintain the current level of interest rates, repeating an approach taken in January. Before that, the Fed had cut rates at three consecutive meetings.

""For now, it does seem like a fairly clear decision for us to wait and see,"" Powell said.

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), a policymaking body at the Fed, said Wednesday that key economic indicators had improved but it cautioned of heightened economic uncertainty.

""Risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen,"" the FOMC said in a statement.

Last month, Powell raised the possibility that Trump's tariffs may cause what economists call ""stagflation,"" which is when inflation rises and the economy slows.

If the Fed raises interest rates as a means of protecting against tariff-induced inflation under such a scenario, it risks stifling borrowing and slowing the economy further. On the other hand, if the Fed lowers rates to stimulate the economy in the face of a potential slowdown, it threatens to boost spending and worsen inflation.

Still, Powell pointed to solid economic performance as a reason to take a patient approach as policymakers await the impact of tariffs.

""For the time being, we are well-positioned to wait for greater clarity,"" Powell told an audience at the Economic Club of Chicago.

Powell noted the possibility of a shift in economic conditions, saying, ""Life moves pretty fast.""

The rate decision arrives days after fresh data showed robust job growth in April.

Despite flagging consumer sentiment and market turmoil, the labor market has provided a bright spot since Trump took office. Meanwhile, inflation cooled in March, the most recent month for which data is available.

Even so, recession fears are mounting on Wall Street as Trump's tariffs threaten to upend global trade. Goldman Sachs earlier this month hiked its odds of a recession from 35% to 45%. JPMorgan pegged the probability of a recession this year at 60%.

A government report last week showed the U.S. economy shrank over the first three months of 2025, much of which took place as Trump's flurry of tariff proposals stoked uncertainty among businesses and consumers.

U.S. gross domestic product, or GDP, declined at a 0.3% annualized rate over three months ending in March, according to government data released on Wednesday. The figure marked a sharp dropoff from 2.4% annualized growth over the final three months of 2024.

The rate decision on Wednesday also marks the first adjustment of borrowing costs since Trump's closely watched ""Liberation Day"" tariff announcement on April 2, which triggered the biggest single-day stock market drop since the COVID-19 pandemic.

Days later, Trump suspended a major swathe of the tariffs, sending the market to one of its largest ever single-day increases. A simultaneous escalation of tariffs on Chinese goods kept the effective tariff rate at its highest level in more than a century, the Yale Budget Lab found.

The White House is seeking to strike trade agreements with dozens of U.S. trade partners before the 90-day suspension of so-called ""reciprocal tariffs"" expires in July.

The new scheme has been rapidly approved as countries across East and Southeast Asia look to shield themselves from the financial volatility unleashed by US President Donald Trump’s global tariff war, which has triggered turbulence in the US Treasuries market and an Asian currency rally in recent days.

It may also herald a deeper, longer-term shift towards a regional monetary mechanism that is less reliant on the dollar – and gives China a bigger role.

Port officials said traffic is down nearly half at the two Southern California ports, signaling that there are fewer products now in LA from China and that there will be fewer jobs.

“We are at a point of inflection. It’s kind of dire,” Mario Cordero, port of Long Beach CEO said Monday. “What happens here is going to be an indication of what's going to occur in the supply chain. We have less vessel calls, less cargo now.”

The port of Long Beach is already reporting a huge drop in traffic this week with 34 canceled sailings from ocean carriers to Long Beach. The neighboring port of Los Angeles is also seeing 36 cancelations.

Things have not been this slow since the coronavirus pandemic, Cordero said.

“Covid gave us an insight of what happens when the cargo stops. We certainly don’t want to repeat that scenario again,” he added.

The two ports, which moved 20 million containers last year, are showing a 44% drop in docked vessels in the week of May 4 compared to last year.

“Every four containers means a job, so when we start dialing back, it means less job opportunity,” Gene Seroka, port of LA CEO, told Bloomberg News Sunday, predicting a sharp decline in dock work for employees, no more overtime or double time and potentially less than 40 hours of work a week.

“Less containers, less jobs, less business for truckers,” Cordero echoed the dire projection.

Trucker drivers in Southern California expressed their concerns in case work dries up.

“It definitely brings uncertainty for everybody because we don’t know what’s going to happen, “ a driver named Helen said. “Definitely a lot of people are going to start losing their jobs. They are going to start to be laid off.”

Fewer truck drivers and dock workers mean less business for shops and stores that support them, including Berth 55, a seafood deli, nearby.

Rafeal Arias Anaya, who works at the fish market, said he is seeing fewer truckers coming in for lunch, which leads him to worry that he, too, will be forced to cut back work.

“There’s no win situation with the kind of tariffs we are seeing,” Cordero said, alerting consumers that they will soon feel the trickled-down impact soon.

“For the consumer, we are jeopardizing having products on the shelves in the next couple of months.”

Even if the Trump administration reaches a deal with China or other foreign nations, it’s still going to take about a month to get things back on track.","As the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach this week begin to feel the impact of tariffs imposed on foreign goods by the Trump administration, a reduction in traffic and cargo was visible at the busiest ports in the U.S. on Monday.

The Committee will continue to monitor closely the risks of inflation persistence and what the evidence may reveal about the balance between aggregate supply and demand in the economy. Monetary policy will need to continue to remain restrictive for sufficiently long until the risks to inflation returning sustainably to the 2% target in the medium term have dissipated further. The Committee will decide the appropriate degree of monetary policy restrictiveness at each meeting.

At this meeting, the Committee voted to reduce Bank Rate to 4.25%, reflecting continued progress in disinflation though with risks to inflation remaining in both directions.

Monetary policy is not on a pre-set path. The Committee will remain sensitive to heightened unpredictability in the economic environment and will continue to update its assessment of risks.

The May Report sets out two illustrative scenarios. In one scenario, there could be weaker supply and more persistence in domestic wages and prices, including from second-round effects related to the near-term increase in CPI inflation. In another scenario, inflationary pressures could ease more quickly owing to greater or longer-lasting weakness in demand relative to supply, in part reflecting uncertainties globally and domestically.

The Committee remains focused on returning CPI inflation sustainably to target in the medium term. In deciding the appropriate degree and pace of monetary policy adjustments required to achieve this, the Committee has considered a range of possibilities for how domestic inflationary pressures could evolve, as well as the broader circumstances that could necessitate varying the course of policy.

Uncertainty surrounding global trade policies has intensified since the imposition of tariffs by the United States and the measures taken in response by some of its trading partners. There has subsequently been volatility in financial markets, and market-implied policy rates have moved lower. Prospects for global growth have weakened as a result of this uncertainty and new tariff announcements, although the negative impacts on UK growth and inflation are likely to be smaller.

Progress on disinflation in domestic price and wage pressures is generally continuing. Twelve-month CPI inflation fell to 2.6% in March from 2.8% in February, close to expectations in the February Monetary Policy Report. Although indicators of pay growth remain elevated, a significant slowing is still expected over the rest of the year. Wholesale energy prices have fallen back since the February Report. Previous increases in energy prices are still likely to drive up CPI inflation from April onwards, to 3.5% for 2025 Q3. Inflation is expected to fall back thereafter. Measures of household inflation expectations have risen recently.

Underlying UK GDP growth is judged to have slowed since the middle of 2024, and the labour market has continued to loosen.

There has been substantial progress on disinflation over the past two years, as previous external shocks have receded, and as the restrictive stance of monetary policy has curbed second-round effects and stabilised longer-term inflation expectations. That progress has allowed the MPC to withdraw gradually some degree of policy restraint, while maintaining Bank Rate in restrictive territory so as to continue to squeeze out persistent inflationary pressures.

At its meeting ending on 7 May 2025, the MPC voted by a majority of 5–4 to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 4.25%. Two members preferred to reduce Bank Rate by 0.5 percentage points, to 4%. Two members preferred to maintain Bank Rate at 4.5%.

The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. The MPC adopts a medium-term and forward-looking approach to determine the monetary stance required to achieve the inflation target sustainably.

Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 7 May 2025

1: Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed: the international economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; and supply, costs and prices. The latest data on these topics were set out in the accompanying May 2025 Monetary Policy Report.

2: The Committee discussed recent global economic developments, and in particular the likely impact on the outlook for UK inflation of the various changes to trade tariffs that had recently been announced by the United States and some of its trading partners. These potential impacts were discussed in more detail in Box C of the May Report.

3: These trade policy developments were likely to reduce UK activity, and to create further risks to the downside. The impact on UK inflation was more ambiguous at this stage. The baseline expectation was that these developments would push down slightly on inflation over the forecast period. There were material risks on both sides around this judgement, however, including from: weaker global demand; the degree of diversion of exports to non-US markets; how closely the pass-through from global export prices to domestic consumer prices matched previous experience; the level of disruption to supply chains; the extent of further tariff policy announcements; and the risk of broader fragmentation of the global economy and financial system. The Committee would monitor the relevant indicators closely, and would continue to use multiple analytical approaches to evaluate the impact of these developments.

4: Financial markets had been volatile globally following the trade policy announcements in early April, as set out in the May Report. Almost all respondents to the Bank’s latest Market Participants Survey (MaPS) were expecting a 25 basis point reduction in Bank Rate at this MPC meeting, in line with market pricing. Since the MPC's previous meeting the median MaPS respondent expected 75 basis points of further Bank Rate cuts this year, although the overall distribution was now skewed towards more cuts. This was consistent with the market-implied path declining by just under 100 basis points over the rest of the year.

5: The Committee discussed the extent to which movements in UK markets had reflected international factors. International considerations had clearly been the most prominent influence during this period, although, given the US-specific nature of the tariff policy announcements, it was not surprising that the previously close relation between US and UK markets had weakened appreciably in recent weeks. MaPS respondents reported that international factors had generally pushed down on the prospects for activity and inflation, and therefore on near-term UK policy rate expectations, partly offset by the upward impact of domestic factors on inflation.

6: Monthly GDP growth in February had been much stronger than expected, at 0.5%, and Bank staff now estimated that headline GDP growth in 2025 Q1 had been 0.6%. But this news had been accounted for largely by erratic factors, for instance those that had affected output in the manufacturing sector. Bank staff estimated that underlying growth in Q1 had been around zero. Headline GDP growth was projected to slow sharply in Q2, to 0.1%, with risks to the downside, given the signal from high-frequency data. The S&P Global UK composite output PMI had fallen sharply in April, although it remained unclear how much of this decline stemmed from a potentially reversible deterioration in business sentiment.

7: The Committee discussed the extent to which developments in activity had reflected underlying demand and supply drivers, acknowledging that both were likely to have played a role. In the baseline forecast, a margin of slack was expected to continue to open up over the coming years, sufficient to remove remaining excess inflation persistence. Conditioned on the market-implied path for Bank Rate, monetary policy was expected to continue to restrain aggregate demand, while fiscal consolidation was expected to play a greater role in the latter part of the forecast. Potential productivity growth was also expected to pick up. The balance of risks around the baseline forecast for GDP growth was judged to be somewhat to the downside.

8: Twelve-month CPI inflation had fallen to 2.6% in March. The latest evidence from key indicators suggested that progress on underlying disinflation in domestic prices and wages had generally continued, supported by the restrictiveness of monetary policy.

9: The Committee discussed the outlook for a range of nominal indicators. Private sector regular pay growth was expected to slow significantly further by the end of 2025, to around 3¾%, consistent with the latest indications from the Bank’s Agents’ contacts, and from the DMP Survey. That said, survey measures of household inflation expectations had risen further in recent months, perhaps suggesting that households had become more sensitive to inflationary pressures, having recently experienced very high rates of inflation in 2022. Businesses’ medium-term CPI inflation expectations had increased slightly recently, although indicators of medium-term inflation expectations derived from financial markets had generally continued to trend downwards.

10: CPI inflation was expected to rise to a peak of 3.5% on average in 2025 Q3, in large part reflecting developments in household energy bills and, to a lesser degree, regulated prices. This projected increase in headline inflation was still expected to be temporary. The Committee recognised the risk that this projected increase in headline inflation, along with the current trajectory of household inflation expectations, might pose additional risks to persistence if non-linearities were to emerge beyond specific inflation thresholds.

The immediate policy decision

11: The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. The MPC adopts a medium-term and forward-looking approach to determine the monetary stance required to achieve the inflation target sustainably.

12: Underlying UK GDP growth was judged to have slowed since the middle of 2024, and the labour market had continued to loosen.

13: Progress on disinflation in domestic price and wage pressures had generally continued. Twelve-month CPI inflation was 2.6% in March, close to expectations in the February Monetary Policy Report. Although indicators of pay growth had remained elevated, a significant slowing was still expected over the rest of the year. Wholesale energy prices had fallen back since the February Report. Previous increases in energy prices were still likely to drive up CPI inflation from April onwards, to 3.5% on average in 2025 Q3. Inflation was expected to fall back thereafter.

14: Uncertainty surrounding global trade policies had intensified since the imposition of tariffs by the United States and the measures taken in response by some of its trading partners. There had subsequently been volatility in financial markets, and market-implied policy rates had moved lower. Prospects for global growth had weakened as a result of this uncertainty and new tariff announcements, although the negative impacts on UK growth and inflation were likely to be smaller.

15: The Committee remained focused on returning inflation sustainably to the target. In the baseline forecast set out in the May Monetary Policy Report, inflation was expected to return to around the 2% target in the medium term. Overall, the Committee judged that the risks around GDP growth in the baseline forecast were somewhat to the downside, while the risks around the CPI projection were two-sided.

16: In reaching its judgement, and against a backdrop of increased uncertainty, the Committee had been assessing a wide range of risks around the baseline forecast, from both domestic and global factors. The May Monetary Policy Report set out two illustrative scenarios from a much broader set of plausible paths the economy could take. These were intended to explore different economic mechanisms, to which members attached different weights.

17: In the first scenario, greater or longer-lasting weakness in demand relative to supply, in part reflecting uncertainties globally and domestically, might further mitigate inflationary pressures over the medium term. Underlying GDP growth had been weak, and global trade policy uncertainty had risen sharply, which was likely to weigh on household consumption and business investment. It was possible in this environment of uncertainty that precautionary saving could rise and consumption could weaken.

18: In the second scenario, greater persistence in domestic wage- and price-setting, both from additional second-round effects related to the near-term increase in headline CPI inflation and from weaker aggregate supply, might exacerbate the persistence of inflation. Underlying services consumer price inflation and indicators of wage growth had been moderating, but remained at elevated levels. There was evidence that the near-term inflation expectations of firms and households had recently become more reactive to changes in current CPI inflation than they had been pre-Covid. In addition, there were upside risks to inflation stemming from softer growth in potential productivity.

19: More broadly, there were growing risks from potential global trade arrangements. Depending on how trade policies unfolded, UK inflation could be affected by a wide range of factors such as shifts in trade patterns, supply chain disruptions in the UK and abroad, and movements in global exchange rates. It was possible that the ultimate net effect of these developments could be materially more disinflationary for the UK than in the baseline forecast, but it was also possible that the effect could be slightly inflationary in the longer term. Overall, it was too early to conclude over what period and to what degree different economic effects could materialise.

20: All members stressed that monetary policy was not on a pre-set path. The Committee would remain sensitive to heightened unpredictability in the economic environment and would continue to update its assessment of risks.

21: At this meeting, five members voted to reduce Bank Rate to 4.25%. Prior to the latest global developments, most members in this group had judged that this policy decision would be finely balanced between no change in Bank Rate and a further reduction. Although the current impact of the global trade news should not be overstated, the news was sufficient for those members to judge that a reduction in Bank Rate was warranted. This level of Bank Rate would still leave the stance of monetary policy sufficiently restrictive to bear down on inflationary pressures, were they to re-intensify. For the other members in this group, even in the absence of the latest global news, the case for a reduction in Bank Rate at this meeting had been fairly clear. Underlying domestic disinflation was progressing as expected and monetary policy restrictiveness was bearing down on activity.

22: Two members preferred a 0.5 percentage point reduction in Bank Rate at this meeting based on the outlook. The most significant contributions to the expected pickup in inflation would come from one-off tax and administered prices and past energy shocks. Incoming wage settlements had so far been close to the Agents’ annual pay survey figure for the end of 2025, and were approaching sustainable rates, while consumer spending remained weak and investment subdued. Along with domestic demand shifts and emerging slack, recent global developments in energy and trade policy pointed to potential downward risks to global growth and world export prices. In the medium term, a continued monetary policy stance that was too restrictive risked inflation deviating from the 2% target on a sustained basis and the opening up of an unduly large output gap. Given this balance of risks, a less restrictive policy path was warranted.

23: Two members preferred to hold Bank Rate at 4.5%, recognising that short-end market interest rates had already eased by around 40 basis points since the MPC’s previous meeting. For these members, the labour market was proving more resilient than expected, business surveys signalled continued inflationary pressures, and household expectations of inflation had firmed. All these indicators pointed to continued inflation persistence owing in part to structural rigidities on the supply side of the economy. Holding Bank Rate unchanged at this meeting would ensure that monetary policy remained sufficiently restrictive to weigh against stubborn inflationary pressures.

24: Based on the Committee’s evolving view of the medium-term outlook for inflation, a gradual and careful approach to the further withdrawal of monetary policy restraint remained appropriate. The Committee would continue to monitor closely the risks of inflation persistence and what the evidence may reveal about the balance between aggregate supply and demand in the economy. Monetary policy would need to continue to remain restrictive for sufficiently long until the risks to inflation returning sustainably to the 2% target in the medium term had dissipated further. The Committee would decide the appropriate degree of monetary policy restrictiveness at each meeting.

25: The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that:

Bank Rate should be reduced by 0.25 percentage points, to 4.25%.

26: Five members (Andrew Bailey, Sarah Breeden, Megan Greene, Clare Lombardelli and Dave Ramsden) voted in favour of the proposition. Four members voted against the proposition. Two members (Swati Dhingra and Alan Taylor) preferred to reduce Bank Rate by 0.5 percentage points, to 4%. Two members (Catherine L Mann and Huw Pill) preferred to leave Bank Rate unchanged, at 4.5%.

""Because of our long time history and allegiance together, it is a great honour to have the United Kingdom as our FIRST announcement. Many other deals, which are in serious stages of negotiation, to follow!""

Reports that the two countries had struck an agreement first emerged in the New York Times - and Sky News has since been told that terms had now been agreed.

Deputy political editor Sam Coates says he understands a ""heads of terms"" agreement, essentially a preliminary arrangement, has been agreed, which is a ""substantive"" step towards a full deal.

No physical UK-US trade document is expected to be signed today as a result.

While the details are yet to emerge, Sky News business correspondent Paul Kelso understands the UK has agreed to give some concessions on food and agriculture imports from the United States to secure an easing of export tariffs for the car industry.

Kelso said the ""heads of terms"" deal appears to be coming down to what the UK can secure by way of concessions on tariffs.

However, the UK has always maintained that it has ""red lines"" on lowering British food standards.

Shortly after the New York Times report emerged, the value of the British pound rose by 0.4% against the US dollar.

'Renewal for our country'

Mr Trump said ""this should be a very big and exciting day"" for the US and UK, in a post on Truth Social on Thursday, adding there would be an announcement in the Oval Office at 10am local time (3pm UK time).

Meanwhile, Sir Keir Starmer vowed to ""deliver security and renewal for our country"" ahead of an expected press conference this afternoon.

Speaking to the London defence conference, Sir Keir said: ""Talks with the US have been ongoing and you'll hear more from me about that later today.

""But make no mistake, I will always act in our national interest, for workers, businesses and families, to deliver security and renewal for our country.""

Senior Trump officials have been engaging in a flurry of meetings with trading partners since the US president announced his ""liberation day"" tariffs on both the US' geopolitical rivals and allies on 2 April.

Mr Trump imposed a 10% tariff on most countries including the UK during the announcement, along with higher ""reciprocal"" tariff rates for many trading partners.

However, those reciprocal tariffs were later suspended for 90 days.

Britain was not among the countries hit with the higher reciprocal tariffs because it imports more from the US than it exports there.

However, the UK was still impacted by a 25% tariff on all cars and all steel and aluminium imports to the US.

A UK official said on Tuesday that the two countries had made good progress on a trade deal that would likely include lower tariff quotas on steel and cars.

Mr Trump said the same day that he and top administration officials would review potential trade deals with other countries over the next two weeks to decide which ones to accept.

Last week, he said that he has ""potential"" trade deals with India, South Korea and Japan.

Asked on Sky News' Breakfast programme about the UK-EU summit on 19 May and how Sir Keir would balance relationships with the US and EU, Coates said: ""I think it is politically helpful for Keir Starmer to have got the heads of terms, the kind of main points of a US-UK trade deal, nailed down before we see what we have negotiated with the EU -- or, more importantly, Donald Trump sees what we have negotiated with the EU.""

Coates said there was ""always a danger"" that if it happened the other way around, Mr Trump would ""take umbrage"" at negotiations with the EU and ""downgrade, alter or put us further back in the queue"" when it came to a UK-US trade deal.

US and Chinese officials to discuss trade war

It comes as the US and China have been engaged in an escalating trade war since Mr Trump took office in January.

The Trump administration has raised tariffs on Chinese goods to 145% while Beijing has responded with levies of 125% in recent weeks.

US Treasury secretary Scott Bessent and US trade representative Jamieson Greer are set to meet their Chinese counterparts in Switzerland this week to discuss the trade war.

China has made the de-escalation of the tariffs a requirement for trade negotiations, which the meetings are supposed to help establish.","Donald Trump has hailed the trade deal with the UK as ""full and comprehensive"" as he promised it would cement the relationship between the two countries for ""years to come"".

“We are also going to resurrect the American shipbuilding industry, including commercial shipbuilding and military shipbuilding,"" Trump said. “We used to make so many ships. We don’t make them anymore very much, but we’re going to make them very fast, very soon. It will have a huge impact to further enhance our national security.""

Trump announced the creation of a White House Office of Shipbuilding as part of the effort. He also proposed “special tax incentives to bring this industry home to America, where it belongs,"" but did not offer specifics. The White House has not provided additional details on the office’s scope or leadership.

China’s dominance in global shipbuilding was a focal point of Trump’s remarks. The U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) recently announced a fee of up to $1.5 million on Chinese-built vessels entering U.S. ports, citing unfair competition. Trade officials noted that the U.S. ranks 19th in global commercial ship production.

Bipartisan legislation has also been introduced to address these challenges. In December 2024, the Shipbuilding and Harbor Infrastructure for Prosperity and Security (SHIPS) for America Act, introduced by Sens. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., and Todd Young, R-Ind., along with Reps. John Garamendi, D-Calif., and Trent Kelly, R-Miss., seeks to revitalize the U.S. shipbuilding industry through federal oversight, funding, workforce development, and incentives for domestic production, which legislators say have been weakened by decades of neglect.

Trump’s announcement comes as other lawmakers also raise concerns about the state of U.S. shipbuilding. During the recent confirmation hearing for Navy Secretary nominee John Phelan, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker, R-Miss., called for reforms to address delays and budget overruns in major shipbuilding programs.

“We must stabilize shipbuilding programs, adopt commercial best practices and incentivize the shipyards to address workforce and productivity issues in a collaborative rather than combative manner,"" Wicker said. “And we can quickly inject innovation into naval procurement, particularly on unmanned ships.""

Industry leaders responded positively to Trump’s announcement. Shipbuilders Council of America president Matthew Paxton said the initiative is a step toward restoring U.S. competitiveness.

“The U.S. shipyard industry has long played a critical role in national security and remains committed to building the fleet of the future,"" Paxton said. “We applaud the creation of the White House Office of Shipbuilding and stand ready to work with the administration to restore American competitiveness and create thousands of skilled jobs.""

In a LinkedIn post, Eastern Shipbuilding Group, Inc. also voiced support.

“A strong, thriving shipbuilding sector is vital to our nation’s prosperity, national security, and energy dominance,"" the shipyard said in a statement. “By investing in American shipbuilders and restoring American leadership on the seas, the President will improve our security and create high-quality jobs that support families in Florida and communities across the country.""

Despite these measures, experts warn that the U.S. shipbuilding industry still faces challenges in workforce training, supply chain constraints, and overall manufacturing capacity. How the new White House office will address these concerns remains to be seen.","“We are also going to resurrect the American shipbuilding industry, including commercial shipbuilding and military shipbuilding,"" Trump said.

2025-05-09 01:30:55,2025-05-09 09:30:55 +08,https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/news/research/2025/20250508,Inflation Expectations Mixed; Financial Outlook for Households Deteriorates (NY Fed),"NEW YORK—The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Center for Microeconomic Data today released the April 2025 Survey of Consumer Expectations, which shows that inflation expectations were unchanged over the short term, increased over the medium term, and decreased over the longer term. Labor market expectations largely deteriorated in April, with households having lower expectations for both earnings growth and finding a job. Households also expect lower income growth over the next year, and their perceptions about both their current financial situation and their outlook for their financial situation one year from now deteriorated sharply. The survey was fielded from April 1 through April 30, 2025.

The main findings from the April 2025 Survey are:

Inflation

Median inflation expectations were unchanged at the one-year-ahead horizon at 3.6% and increased by 0.2 percentage point at the three-year-ahead horizon to 3.2%, the highest reading since July 2022. In contrast, median inflation expectations decreased by 0.2 percentage point at the five-year-ahead horizon to 2.7%. The survey’s measure of disagreement across respondents (the difference between the 75th and 25th percentile of inflation expectations) increased at the one- and three-year horizons and decreased slightly at the five-year horizon.

Median inflation uncertainty—or the uncertainty expressed regarding future inflation outcomes—increased at all three horizons.

Median home price growth expectations rose by 0.3 percentage point to 3.3%. This increase was broad-based across age, income, and education groups, and was largest for respondents in the West census region. This series has been moving in a narrow range between 3.0% and 3.3% since August 2023.

Year-ahead commodity price expectations increased by 0.3 percentage point for the price of gas to 3.5%, 0.8 percentage point for the cost of medical care to 8.7%, 2.4 percentage points for the cost of college to 9.1%, and 1.8 percentage points for rent to 9.0%. The year-ahead expected price of food decreased by 0.1 percentage point to 5.1%.

Labor Market

Median one-year-ahead expected earnings growth decreased by 0.3 percentage point to 2.5% in April, the lowest reading since December 2023.

Mean unemployment expectations—or the mean probability that the U.S. unemployment rate will be higher one year from now—increased by 0.1 percentage point to 44.1%, the measure’s highest reading since April 2020.

The mean perceived probability of losing one’s job in the next 12 months decreased by 0.4 percentage point to 15.3%. This decrease was most pronounced for those over the age of 60 and those with a high-school education or less. The mean probability of leaving one’s job voluntarily in the next 12 months increased by 0.2 percentage point to 18.2%. This increase was driven by respondents under the age of 40, those with a bachelor’s degree or higher, and those with household income below $50,000 per year.

The mean perceived probability of finding a job in the next three months if one’s current job was lost decreased by 1.9 percentage points to 49.2%, the lowest reading since March 2021. This decrease was most pronounced for respondents over the age of 60.

Household Finance

The median expected growth in household income decreased by 0.2 percentage point to 2.6% in April, the lowest reading since April 2021.

Median household nominal spending growth expectations increased by 0.3 percentage point to 5.2%. This increase was relatively broad-based across age and education groups.

Perceptions of credit access compared to a year ago improved in April, with the net share of households reporting it is easier versus harder to obtain credit than one year ago increasing. Expectations for future credit availability were largely unchanged.

The average perceived probability of missing a minimum debt payment over the next three months increased by 0.3 percentage point to 13.9%.

The median expected year-ahead change in taxes at current income level increased by 0.1 percentage point to 3.3% but remains well below the 12-month trailing average of 3.7%.

Median year-ahead expected growth in government debt increased by 0.2 percentage point to 4.8%, but remains near the March 2025 series low of 4.6%.

The mean perceived probability that the average interest rate on saving accounts will be higher in 12 months increased by 0.4 percentage point to 26.5%.

Perceptions about households’ current financial situations compared to a year ago deteriorated sharply in April, with the share of households reporting a worse situation rising and the share reporting a better situation declining. Similarly, year-ahead expectations about households’ financial situations deteriorated sharply.

The mean perceived probability that U.S. stock prices will be higher 12 months from now increased by 1.9 percentage points to 35.7%.



About the Survey of Consumer Expectations (SCE)



The SCE contains information about how consumers expect overall inflation and prices for food, gas, housing, and education to behave. It also provides insight into Americans’ views about job prospects and earnings growth and their expectations about future spending and access to credit. The SCE also provides measures of uncertainty regarding consumers’ outlooks. Expectations are also available by age, geography, income, education, and numeracy.

The SCE is a nationally representative, internet-based survey of a rotating panel of approximately 1,300 household heads. Respondents participate in the panel for up to 12 months, with a roughly equal number rotating in and out of the panel each month. Unlike comparable surveys based on repeated cross-sections with a different set of respondents in each wave, this panel allows us to observe the changes in expectations and behavior of the same individuals over time. For further information on the SCE, please refer to an overview of the survey methodology here, the FAQs, the interactive chart guide, and the survey questionnaire.","Labor market expectations largely deteriorated in April, with households having lower expectations for both earnings growth and finding a job.

2025-05-08 23:01:43,2025-05-09 07:01:43 +08,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/07/business/trade-deal-trump,Trump will announce a ‘major trade deal’ with the UK Thursday | CNN Business,"CNN —

President Donald Trump made a significant trade announcement Thursday with the United Kingdom, yet another sign of some possible relief from historically high tariffs that have threatened serious damage to the US and global economies.

The deal, hammered out at the 11th hour in a late-night call with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer Wednesday, is still in flux with details to be “ironed out,” Starmer said via a phone call into the Oval Office Thursday. But it marks a potential framework for other countries to get a reprieve from America’s tariffs.

Trump said the deal with the UK would be substantial.

“The agreement with the United Kingdom is a full and comprehensive one that will cement the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom for many years to come,” Trump said in a Truth Social post Thursday morning. “Because of our long time history and allegiance together, it is a great honor to have the United Kingdom as our FIRST announcement. Many other deals, which are in serious stages of negotiation, to follow!”

“This should be a very big and exciting day for the United States of America and the United Kingdom,” he said in a separate message.

However, the announcement with the UK is limited in scope, heavy on future commitments and leave in place the existing 10% universal tariffs Trump placed on virtually all goods coming into the United States during his “Liberation Day” announcement on April 2, according to a US and UK official who previewed the deal for CNN.

Trump on Thursday called it a “huge deal” but didn’t announce many aspects of the deal in the Oval Office, instead offering broad strokes. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the United Kingdom would reduce trade barriers of several agricultural products, including ethanol and beef, and machinery to the United States.

Britain will also be able to send 100,000 cars into the United States at a 10% tariff rate, reduced from the 25% autos tariffs Trump imposed on foreign cars, Lutnick announced. The UK will also join the US in imposing 25% tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum, creating a joint tariff agreement that will create a free trade zone for those metals between the two countries. Pharmaceuticals will also be exempt from tariffs between the two countries.

The countries’ officials stressed to CNN that there were still some details in flux – a point reiterated by Starmer and Peter Mandelson, the British ambassador to the United States, on Thursday. But the outlines of that announcement develop a concrete pathway to a broader trade pact.

Starmer has made the pursuit of a deal with Trump a key component of the bilateral relationship and made a point of elevating trade as key focus in his closed-door discussions with Trump during a visit to the White House in February. UK officials have expressed keen interest in a wide-ranging trade deal, but in recent weeks have taken a more targeted approach, pressing the administration on market access and options to ease Trump’s 25% auto and steel tariffs.

Financial markets cheered the news of a deal. The Dow rose nearly 400 points, or 0.9%. The broader S&P 500 was up 0.8%, and the Nasdaq was 1.1% higher. The FTSE 100 fell 0.2% after the trade news and a rate-cut announcement from the Bank of England earlier in the day Thursday.

Not a real ‘deal’

Despite the administration’s rhetoric that it is in advanced trade negotiations with more than a dozen countries, actual trade deals take significant time, often years, to hash out. They typically involve incredibly complex agreements, delving into the minutiae of various goods and non-tariff barriers. They often involve significant political considerations, as various parties seek to protect voters with special interests.

Instead, the “deal” Trump announced is more like a memorandum of understanding. That may result in lower tariffs on one particular country’s goods in the near term, but they’ll do little that amounts to a substantial economic win for quite some time.

In return for the United States easing the burden of the steel and aluminum tariffs on the United Kingdom, UK officials have proposed easing digital tax levies on large US tech companies and a concrete negotiating pathway to a more wide-ranging deal, the people said.

The announcement surprised some UK officials, who viewed recent weeks of talks as productive, but not reflective of an imminent agreement.

“This is expected to be a ‘heads of terms’ agreement which sets the broad contours of the arrangement,” JPMorgan analyst Allan Monks wrote in a note to clients Thursday. “The full details are yet to be determined bilaterally and will follow further negotiations”

JPMorgan said the scope of the deal appears limited, because US tariffs on the UK are expected to remain higher than they were before Trump’s “Liberation Day” announcement on April 2. The economic benefit to the United Kingdom will be small, Monks said.

More deals to come

This is just a single agreement. But the framework of a deal, however, provides a pathway for other countries to reach agreements with the United States that could lower their tax burdens.

Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs that went into effect April 7 and were paused for 90 days on April 9 affect dozens of countries. A hundred or so more are subject to the 10% universal tariff. The administration can’t possibly get those all done by July 8.

US officials described the rapid push towards an announcement as a reflection of Trump’s view of the UK offer as well as his long-standing regard for the “special relationship” underpinning the two close allies. He’s also quickly developed an appreciation for Starmer, one of the people said.

The broader economic and geopolitical dynamics have also been a factor in recent days, though administration officials have downplayed the extent. Trump is keenly aware that foreign leaders, business executives and, just this week, the Federal Reserve chair are all anxiously awaiting any sign of progress in the ongoing negotiations.

“The 90-day tariff pause, which is now roughly 25% over, provides little time for the typical back-and-forth trade discussions that require months if not years to craft a trade deal,” said Jacob Jensen, trade policy analyst at the American Action Forum, a center-right policy institute.

“There is a significant difference if these deals are official, written trade agreements rather than verbal commitments to buy more US products, as one has long-term economic implications and the other can be ignored down the line,” he added.

Trump said last month he would not extend the tariffs a second time — and, in fact, may act sooner to reinstate some tariffs for countries with whom his administration cannot reach an agreement, perhaps in a matter of a couple weeks.

“It will be difficult for the US trade representative to negotiate potentially 100 separate trade agreements within 90 days, meaning President Trump must soon determine whether tariffs will be reinstated or delayed further,” Jensen said.

And even if deals are ultimately completed with all countries, there’s no guarantee Trump would keep them. For example, Trump, in his first term, was instrumental in negotiating the USMCA free trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, only to abandon it in his second term, charging an on-again, off-again 25% tariff on some Mexican and Canadian goods. And by placing significant tariffs on virtually all goods coming into the United States, Trump also blew up a number of existing trade deals with allies.

Signs of de-escalation

For weeks, Trump officials have said they are talking to more than a dozen countries and are nearing a deal – and they are in advanced negotiations with India, the UK, South Korea and Japan. But Trump has frequently said he is in no rush to sign a deal, claiming that countries have been “ripping off” America for years and the high tariffs the United States has imposed will help balance trade.

Trump’s announcement of a trade deal with the UK is the second significant sign this week that the administration may be open to negotiations that would ultimately lower some tariffs on foreign nations.

On Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that he and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will both travel to Geneva, Switzerland, where they will meet their Chinese counterparts.

Although Bessent told Fox News not to expect a major trade deal from the meetings, he acknowledged it was an important step in negotiations and could de-escalate tensions that have led the United States to place at least a 145% tariff on most Chinese goods. In turn, China has placed a 125% tariff on US goods.

Trump, however, on Wednesday said he would not lower the high tariffs on China in advance of discussions, which Beijing has previously said was a pre-condition for talks.

When asked in the Oval Office whether he was open to pulling back the historically high tariffs to get China to the negotiating table, Trump replied simply with: “No.”

Nevertheless, any thaw in the trade war could be a welcome sign for businesses and consumers in both countries and around the globe.

The punishing tariffs have already damaged economies around the world — particularly America’s. The US economy went into reverse in the first quarter, its first contraction in three years, as businesses stockpiled goods in anticipation of Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs, which began in the second quarter.

Although the China-US trade standoff is by far the most aggressive, Trump has imposed large tariffs on most other countries around the world too: a 10% universal tariff on virtually all goods entering the United States, plus 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum, autos, auto parts and some goods from Mexico and Canada.

So the world will be watching Thursday’s announcement and the US-China talks this weekend with anticipation.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday said at a press conference that tariffs could do serious damage to America’s economy. But he said the trade talks the United States is holding with foreign countries could prevent the worst-case scenario.

Global economists at the International Monetary Fund, OECD and World Bank have all predicted that Trump’s trade war would have disastrous effects on the global economy, slowing growth dramatically in some countries, while reigniting inflation. Many US economists and large banks predict the United States could enter a recession this year.

“It’s so bizarre,” said Jan Valeskog, Stockholm’s vice-mayor for planning. “It’s our political priorities that count, not the ones from this embassy or any other embassies.”

In March, European officials lambasted the US after companies across the continent said they had received letters informing them that the Trump administration’s crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives also applied to foreign firms looking to do business with the US government.

The letter – described by French officials as “a form of interference” – asked recipients to complete, sign and return a form certifying that they “do not operate any programmes to promote diversity, equity and inclusion”.

The letter added: “If you do not agree to sign this document, we would appreciate it if you could provide detailed reasons, which we will forward to our legal teams.”

In Stockholm, Valeskog said he had received the letter on Tuesday. “We were really surprised, because diversity, equality and inclusion are values that we strive for and stand up for in Stockholm,” he said. “It’s very important for us.”

He presumed the letter was sent to the planning office because it was listed as a payee, given that it charges for building permits. Still, it was the first time he had heard of one of these letters being directed at a municipality or foreign government. “It’s quite unique,” he said.

After Valeskog spoke to the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter about the letter, emails and social media responses came pouring in from city residents and others across Sweden. “Thousands of people are really upset,” he said. “I guess most people are following the news about what is happening in the States. But suddenly it felt closer with these demands.”

For months – despite research showing that companies with greater gender and ethnic diversity are more likely to significantly outperform their peers – Trump’s administration has opposed efforts to ensure that people of all backgrounds, including historically marginalised groups such as women and people of colour, can gain a foothold and thrive at organisations.

Valeskog said Stockholm had no intention of complying. “Of course, we’ll not sign it, we won’t return it, we’ll do nothing about it,” he said. “So now it’s up to the embassy to decide what happens next.”

The spate of US letters comes at a delicate moment for the transatlantic relationship, which has been left rattled by threats of escalating tariffs, security concerns and the Signal leaks that laid bare the Trump administration’s disdain for Europe.

On Tuesday Valeskog called on the embassy, with whom they had traditionally had a good relationship, to withdraw the letter. Two days later, there had been no reaction. “They don’t have an ambassador, maybe that’s the reason – I don’t know,” he said.

After describing the fallout over the letter as “their headache, not ours” earlier in the week, he again stressed that the US embassy stood to lose much more if it decided to break off its relationship with the municipality. “The embassy now and then needs our building permits, of course, so it’s in their interest to have a good contact and cooperation with the city of Stockholm,” he said. “And so this is really strange.”

He said his office would continue to wait for some sort of response from the Americans. “I mean it’s quite big news, not only in Sweden but also in other countries,” he said. “So we’ll see what happens.”","The letter added: “If you do not agree to sign this document, we would appreciate it if you could provide detailed reasons, which we will forward to our legal teams.”In Stockholm, Valeskog said he had received the letter on Tuesday.

In an interview with Fox News, JD Vance said, ""What we can do is try to encourage these folks to de-escalate a little bit, but we’re not going to get involved in the middle of war that’s fundamentally none of our business and has nothing to do with America’s ability to control it.""

""You know, America can’t tell the Indians to lay down their arms. We can’t tell the Pakistanis to lay down their arms. And so, we’re going to continue to pursue this thing through diplomatic channels,"" Vance said.

""Our hope and our expectation is that this is not going to spiral into a broader regional war or, God forbid, a nuclear conflict. Right now, we don’t think that’s going to happen,"" Vance added.

Pakistan on Thursday escalated the tense situation by targeting civilian and military areas with a swarm of drones, missiles and intense artillery shelling. While India on May 7 targeted terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (POK) as part of Operation Sindoor. India not only intercepted the drones and missiles, but also took down Pakistani fighter jets and an Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS).

Earlier, US President Donald Trump said if he could do anything to help, ""I will be there"" and wants the escalating conflict between the two countries to ""stop"".

""Oh it's so terrible. My position is I get along with both. I know both very well and I want to see them work it out. I want to see them stop and hopefully they can stop now. They have gone tit for tat so hopefully they can stop now. I know them both, we get along with both the countries very well.

""Good relationships with both and I want to see it stop. And If I can do anything to help I will be there,"" Trump said in response to a question on the 'war' between India and Pakistan.

Trump has also said that he hopes that the hostilities will end ""very quickly"".

""It's a shame, he said, adding, ""We heard about it just as we were walking in the doors of the Oval (Office). I guess people knew something was going to happen based on a little bit of the past."" ""They've been fighting for a long time. They've been fighting for many, many decades and centuries, actually, if you really think about it,"" Trump said.

France is ramping up its production of Hammer bombs, which Ukraine has used to take out Russian military targets.

French company Safran Electronics & Defense told Business Insider that it is increasing production of AASM Hammer bombs by more than 40% this year.

A company spokeswoman told BI that it expects to make 1,200 AASMs in 2025, up from 830 in 2024.

And the company plans on going further. The spokeswoman added that ""we plan to double this rate over the next few years, if the orders are there.""

It's unclear how many of the bombs will go to Ukraine's military. The spokesperson said she couldn't give details on that, but added, ""I can confirm that AASMs are combat-proven and used in Ukraine.""

The Hammer is an air-to-surface weapon with a guidance and propulsion kit that turns munitions into precision-guided bombs capable of deep strikes and close-air-support missions.

They have been fitted to Ukraine's older, Soviet-era jets, and footage has shown them allegedly striking Russian troops and drone hubs. Ukraine also said it used them to hit a control center in Russia.

Safran said the Hammer has a range of more than 43 miles.

Hammer bombs are a type of glide bomb, a piece of weaponry that Ukraine has increasingly adopted throughout the war, after Russia used them to devastating effect.

Glide bombs are typically older munitions that have been converted into precision-guided weapons that are hard to intercept. They're also significantly cheaper than many other types of weaponry, which means they can be easily mass-produced.

Ukraine has increasingly used glide bombs, including domestically made ones.

Safran has adapted the Hammer bombs so they could be used with Ukraine's MiG-29 and Su-25 aircraft.

It's not clear how many Hammer bombs Ukraine has received to date, but France's defense minister, Sébastien Lecornu, said in January 2024 that France would be delivering 50 to Ukraine every month.

Safran's jump in production comes as European defense companies increasingly look to boost their production, as European nations increase their aid to Ukraine and their own defense spending.

Europe's overall defense spending has soared since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022, with many countries fearful that Russia may attack elsewhere on the continent.

European leaders have warned that much more needs to be done, including countries placing larger orders and changing rules that may be preventing defense-related industries from ramping up production.

Some European defense companies have said that they need larger orders to give them the confidence to make sizable investments, like new production facilities, that would allow them to grow their output over many years.","France is ramping up its production of Hammer bombs, which Ukraine has used to take out Russian military targets.

The European Union will propose tariffs on Boeing Co. aircraft and US-made cars if talks with President Donald Trump’s administration fail to de-escalate a brewing trade conflict, according to people familiar with the deliberations.

US industrial goods face the biggest reprisals, while food and agriculture products also will be among the top categories in a new list of duties that the commission will make public on Thursday, the people said on condition of anonymity because the discussions are private. About €100 billion ($114 billion) in American exports would be hit with additional tariffs, Bloomberg reported Tuesday.

A surcharge on Boeing sales would help equalize a playing field that EU officials consider unfair to Toulouse, France-based Airbus SE, whose imports to the US are now subject to tariffs, one person said.

Slapping Boeing with tariffs also would punish America’s biggest manufacturing exporter, should the EU decide to counter the unilateral levies Trump imposed on the bloc along with dozens of other US trading partners. The simultaneous US tariff war with China already is squeezing Boeing, with Beijing telling airlines to refrain from taking delivery of its jets.

The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm that handles trade matters, has been meeting with US officials ever since Trump announced a 20% universal tariff — reduced to 10% until July — on almost all imports from the EU. He also imposed a 25% levy on cars and metals.

A spokesperson for the commission declined to comment on the plans. A Boeing spokesperson couldn’t immediately be reached.

Boeing shares fell as much as 1.3% in New York. The stock has risen 4.4% this year as the company makes progress in improving manufacturing quality.

Negotiations between the EU and US have made scant progress and the expectation is that the bulk of the American tariffs will remain in place. The EU said on Tuesday that Trump’s ongoing trade investigations will boost the amount of the bloc’s goods facing tariffs to €549 billion, or 97% of the total.

The US imported more than $52.3 billion worth of new vehicles from the EU last year, according to Commerce Department data. Much of the $11.3 billion worth of autos that the US exported to the bloc were sport utility vehicles built by German manufacturers BMW AG and Mercedes-Benz Group AG.","Most Read from BloombergThe European Union will propose tariffs on Boeing Co. aircraft and US-made cars if talks with President Donald Trump’s administration fail to de-escalate a brewing trade conflict, according to people familiar with the deliberations.

Russia will restrict internet access across several regions, including Moscow, during its May 9 Victory Day celebrations this year, as the Kremlin imposes ever-tighter controls over its population.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Wednesday that mobile internet restrictions would be in place in several regions while foreign leaders are in Moscow for the celebrations marking the surrender of Nazi Germany in World War II.

Peskov said the restrictions are because Russia has ""dangerous neighbors.""

""These are not disruptions, but restrictions for obvious reasons,"" he said. ""We want the glorious Victory Day to be celebrated at the appropriate level.""

Russian independent media outlet Meduza reported that restrictions have already been put in place in some areas, with Moscow residents experiencing phone and internet access issues since May 5.

Victory Day celebrations are a major propaganda event for Russia's President Vladimir Putin. World leaders, including China's Xi Jinping and Brazil's Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, will attend this year's event.

Putin has also called for a three-day cease-fire with Ukraine over the Victory Day weekend, which Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has rejected, describing the offer as a ""stunt.""

In the run-up to May 9, Ukraine has intensified its drone strike campaign against Russia, hitting Moscow with consecutive nights of attacks that closed its international airports.

Russia's association of tour operators said in a statement on Wednesday that at least 350 flights were affected by the threat of drone strikes.

Zelenskyy suggested that those travelling to the country may not be safe, remarking that ""our position is very simple for all countries travelling to Russia on May 9: We cannot be held responsible for what happens on the territory of the Russian Federation.""

Cuts to internet access

In the wake of its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Russia imposed sweeping internet restrictions on its population.

As part of its ""sovereign internet"" project, and in a bid to more tightly monitor online spaces and access to information, Russia has restricted access to the global internet, as well as VPN services used to circumvent domestic controls.

Further restrictions have already been imposed in areas of Russia targeted by Ukrainian drone strikes, with Russian outlet Kommersant reporting that restrictions were put in place in the city of Rostov on April 25.

Kommersant suggested that this was related to concerns that mobile internet networks could be used to direct drone attacks.

""Russian authorities will likely continue disconnecting large areas of Russia from mobile internet networks during Ukrainian long-range strikes,"" the Washington, D.C.-based Institute for the Study of War wrote on Wednesday.

It said that it would do this ""to continue testing the Sovereign Internet system and, secondarily, prevent Russians from immediately circulating reports, imagery, and footage of the results of these Ukrainian strikes.""","Military vehicles taking part in Russia's Victory Day parade in Moscow in 2024.

However, The Moscow Times noted that although Beijing has become Moscow's largest trading partner since the Kremlin launched its full-scale war against Ukraine, it has so far refrained from significant investment in the real sector of the Russian economy.

Statistics from the Russian Central Bank show that over the past three years, there has been no significant capital inflow from countries the Kremlin considers friendly.

On the contrary, the total volume of foreign direct investment in Russia has continued to decline, falling by US$138 billion in 2022, US$80 billion in 2023 and a further US$63 billion last year.

Since the start of the full-scale invasion, Russia has lost 57% of its foreign investment, with the total volume dropping to US$216 billion – the lowest level since 2009, according to the Russian Central Bank.

Denmark's foreign minister says he will summon the US ambassador to address a report that Washington's spy agencies have been told to focus on Greenland amid Donald Trump's threats to take over the island. ""It worries me greatly because we do not spy on friends,"" Lars Løkke Rasmussen said, responding to the report in The Wall Street Journal. According to the newspaper, US spy agencies were told to focus efforts on the semi-autonomous country's independence movement, and American goals to extract mineral resources there. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard accused the Journal of attempts to ""undermine"" President Trump ""by politicizing and leaking classified information"".

While not denying the report, she accused the newspaper of ""breaking the law and undermining our nation's security and democracy"". Rasmussen, who was attending an EU ministers meeting in Warsaw, said the report was ""somewhat disturbing"". ""We are going to call in the US acting ambassador for a discussion at the foreign ministry to see if we can confirm this information,"" Rasmussen said. ""It doesn't seem to be strongly rejected by those who speak out. That worries me."" The Danish Security and Intelligence Service (PET) declined to comment on the article, but told Danish media that it had ""naturally"" taken note of US interest in Greenland. Based on international interest in Greenland in general, the agency said, there was an increased espionage threat against it and Denmark. President Trump has repeatedly vowed to take control of Greenland, most recently telling NBC News on Sunday that he had not ruled out using military force to seize the arctic island. ""I don't say I'm going to do it, but I don't rule out anything,"" he said. ""We need Greenland very badly. Greenland is a very small amount of people, which we'll take care of, and we'll cherish them, and all of that. But we need that for international security.""

During a speech to Congress in March, Trump told US lawmakers that ""one way or the other, we're going to get it.""

White smoke emanating from the Sistine Chapel chimney today to inform the world’s 1.4 billion Catholics and everyone else that the conclave of 133 cardinals have determined a new Bishop of Rome. Who the successor to St. Peter and the progressive Pope Francis, who died at the age of 88 on April 21, is has not yet been made public.

Having said that, as cable news and the internet goes wall-to-wall white smoke, the unveiling of the newly appointed Pontiff is expected within a hour or so to appear on the balcony. At that time the world will learn what name the now elevated former cardinal has chosen for his Papacy.

In a ceremony reaching back to 1274 in its present form, a Pope is elected from the cardinals’ ranks with a required two-thirds majority. Achieving that majority is what leads to multiple ballots among the conclave. The first of what was four scheduled ballots Thursday concluded around 1:30 am PT or 10:30 am local time in Rome. With no Pope elected that round, a plume of black smoke soon afterwards blew out of from the temporary chimney erected atop the Sistine Chapel. The lack of a leader for the Holy See also meant there was no ringing of the bells of St. Peter’s Basilica this morning.

Watch on Deadline

At that point, the cardinals took a break and resumed voting about an hour later. Now the bells are ringing aloud over the cheers of tens of thousands.

Dramatic license aside, the Oscar-nominated Conclave, starring Ralph Fiennes, Stanley Tucci, Isabella Rossellini, and John Lithgow, put a spotlight over the last year on the process of selecting a new Pope. Accurately displaying the absent of smartphones and the isolation of the cardinals that is actually part of a conclave, Conclave the movie also leans into fiction with its depiction of the political maneuvering that takes place in the exercise.

Still, even with thousands of journalists awaiting the results of Thursday morning’s balloting, there is much about what went on behind locked doors with the College of Cardinals this week that will likely never be known.

Likely to be asked by Vatican watchers is what instructions the rookie cardinals, most of whom were selected by Francis over his 12-year reign, received and asked for to carry out their duties. Also, an explanation as to why Day One of voting on May 7 to fill the Papal vacancy went hours longer than anticipated will surely be near the top of the list of inquiries.

As ballots were burned, black smoke billowed out of the Vatican chimney around 9 pm local time on Wednesday indicating the cardinals had not reached the majority requirement. Unto itself, besides the late hour, that wasn’t unusual or unexpected. It took two days with four and five ballots respectively for Benedict XVI in 2005 and Francis in 2013 for a Pope to be chosen.

In 1978, the selection of Polish Cardinal Karol Wojtyła to be John Paul II went longer than that of his immediate successors and his predecessors. The future head of the Holy See’s election took eight ballots and three days. Which is a lot better than the papal conclave that followed the death of Clement IV. That conclave ran from 1268 to 1271, and only ended with the election of Gregory X after the bickering cardinals were finally refused food and exposed to the elements to get the job done.

Thankfully for all concerned, that wasn’t required this year.","In a ceremony reaching back to 1274 in its present form, a Pope is elected from the cardinals’ ranks with a required two-thirds majority.

In total, macro-financial assistance stands at €18.1 billion, contributing to the EU's participation in the G7 Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration initiative. This initiative is intended to provide Ukraine with around €45 billion in financial support.

These loans are to be repaid using the income generated from frozen Russian state assets in the EU. With this payment, the total amount of loans to Ukraine from the Commission under this programme in 2025 has reached €6 billion.

Ukraine’s Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal stated that these funds would be directed toward covering critically important budget expenditures and strengthening the state.

India’s Operation Sindoor has not just avenged the deaths of the 26 people in the Pahalgam attack, but also had a far-reaching impact on the global fight against terrorism. The Indian Armed Forces’ precision strikes on Wednesday reportedly killed Abdul Rauf Azhar, the operational head of Jaish-e-Mohammad and mastermind of the IC-814 hijacking.

Azhar was involved in the kidnapping and murder of Wall Street Journal journalist Daniel Pearl in 2002. Hence, yesterday’s strikes on nine terror hubs in PoK and Pakistan delivered justice to the American-Jewish journalist.

How is Azhar connected to Pearl’s death?

Azhar’s role in orchestrating the 1999 Kandahar hijack facilitated the release of Omar Saeed Sheikh, a key Al-Qaeda operative, who kidnapped and murdered Pearl. The journalist was beheaded in 2002, an execution that shocked the world.

An investigative journalist, Pearl disappeared in Pakistan’s Karachi on January 23, 2002. He was reportedly scheduled to interview a religious leader as part of his research into Islamic extremism.

He was abducted near a cafe, where terrorists captured him and accused him of being a spy. Identifying themselves as the National Movement for the Restoration of Pakistani Sovereignty, the group demanded the release of Pakistanis imprisoned by the United States.

Is Rauf Azhar dead?

Reportedly, yes. According to a report by News18, officials have said that precision attacks carried out in Pakistan’s Punjab province killed Azhar.

“Among those reported eliminated is Abdul Rauf Azhar — operational head of Jaishe-Mohammad, mastermind of the IC-814 hijacking, and a central figure in international jihadist networks,"" the officials said.

On Tuesday, thousands of Panamanians marched in the capital in the largest protest yet against an agreement signed during last month’s visit by U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.

The U.S. embassy followed with a statement Wednesday saying that the agreement did not allow for establishing military bases in Panama.

The locations where U.S. troops and contractors will have access will always remain under the control of Panama and it can terminate the agreement with six months notice, the Panamanian government has said.

Protests during recent weeks have closed streets and drawn thousands.

Moscow's friends in the bloc say it's a 'serious mistake',"""We recognize the strategic goal of reducing energy dependence on third countries, and Slovakia is ready to work on this together with the European Union but ... this is simply economic suicide to agree that neither gas, nor nuclear, nor oil [can be imported from Russia], that everything must end just because some new Iron Curtain is being built between the Western world and perhaps Russia and other countries,"" Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico said Wednesday, in comments reported by Slovak news agency TASR and translated by Google.

Slovakia and Hungary, whose governments have maintained warm ties with Moscow despite the war in Ukraine, described the EU's latest plans as a ""serious mistake"" that would harm the region.

The EU's latest proposals have already prompted a furious response from eastern European nations which have traditionally been more reliant on cheaper energy supplies from Russia, and which repeatedly warn of higher energy prices for consumers as a result of banning such supplies.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 prompted the EU to ban most seaborne imports of Russian oil, coal and refined petroleum products , but reducing gas flows has proved more difficult. In 2024, almost 19% of the EU's gas and LNG imports still came from Russia, according to data from the European Commission , although that's down from 2021 when 45% of the region's gas came from the major oil and gas exporter.

The European Commission announced plans on Tuesday to phase out Russian gas, nuclear energy and liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports by the end of 2027, saying the move ""paves the way to ensure the EU's full energy independence from Russia.""

Russia's allies in Eastern Europe say Brussels plans to end all Russian gas and energy imports in the coming years are tantamount to ""economic suicide"" and a threat to the region's energy security and economy.

In this pool photograph distributed by Russian state agency Sputnik, Russia's President Vladimir Putin shakes hands with Slovakia's Prime Minister Robert Fico prior to their talks in Moscow on Dec. 22, 2024.

Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó said Wednesday that the EU's proposals were ""politically motivated"" and a ""serious mistake.""

""It threatens energy security, drives up prices and violates sovereignty. They want us to bear the cost of their reckless support for Ukraine and its rushed EU accession. We firmly reject this,"" the minister commented on X.

Both Hungary and Slovakia have pushed back against previous EU initiatives to cut energy ties with Moscow, instead opting to maintain supplies amid fears of mounting energy costs at home.

Both have also been vocally critical of giving more military and financial assistance to Ukraine and have previously threatened refused to back the EU's regular extensions of sanctions against Russia. Both looked to extract concessions from the bloc before approving their renewal, most recently in March.

In announcing its latest plans to distance itself from Russia, the EU said Tuesday that its ""roadmap"" to phasing out all Russian energy imports would first introduce a ban on all imports of Russian gas (both pipeline and LNG) under new contracts and existing spot contracts, which would take effect by the end of 2025, before all remaining imports are phased out by the end of 2027.

The Commission's legislative proposals, to be presented in June, will require approval from the European Parliament and a qualified majority of member states, meaning the plans cannot be vetoed by just a few countries.

""We can adopt it without unanimity,"" European Commissioner for Energy Dan Jorgensen said in a press conference Tuesday, adding, ""I hope that everybody will vote for it, obviously, but if they don't, that is also ok, that is also part of the European Union that sometimes the majority makes decisions when necessary.""

He added that the bloc was currently in an ""unacceptable situation"" in which it was dependent on a Russian state and leader, President Vladimir Putin, who had ""chosen to weaponize energy."" He added that importing Russian gas had indirectly helped to fill the Kremlin's ""war chests"" to continue its war against Ukraine.

The Commission said in its statement Tuesday that it envisaged a ""gradual and well-coordinated"" approach across bloc, with member states being asked to prepare national plans by the end of this year ""setting out how they will contribute to phasing out imports of Russian gas, nuclear energy and oil."" It's uncertain whether Slovakia and Hungary will accede to the request.

A Commission spokesperson told CNBC Wednesday that it ""will work closely with all Member States on the implementation of this plan, especially with those mostly concerned. This is why we are proposing a gradual and well-managed phaseout, which is backed by continuous efforts at diversification and better use of energy infrastructure.""

CNBC has asked the Kremlin for a response to the EU's proposals and is awaiting a reply.","Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 prompted the EU to ban most seaborne imports of Russian oil, coal and refined petroleum products , but reducing gas flows has proved more difficult.

. Kashmir has remained a contested region between India and Pakistan since the 1947 partition of British India, with the two nations having fought three wars over the territory. The most recent conflict occurred in 1999, following nuclear tests by both countries. The artillery shortage comes amid heightened tensions following an 22 April attack in the Pahalgam area of Indian-administered Kashmir. A group called Kashmir Resistance claimed responsibility for the assault on a tourist village, resulting in 26 fatalities. The group cited dissatisfaction with the resettlement of over 85,000 outsiders in the region as their motivation. India has accused Pakistan of supporting the militants responsible, a claim Pakistan denies

Sources within Indian intelligence indicate that Pakistan’s current ammunition stockpiles would only sustain high-intensity combat operations for approximately four days.

This depletion stems from extensive exports to conflict zones, particularly Ukraine and Israel, according to ANI News and Lokhma Times.

Pakistani ammunition factories became undisclosed suppliers to Ukraine following Russia’s full-scale invasion, Indian media reports. Between February and March 2023, Pakistan shipped 42,000 122mm rockets for Grad BM-21 systems, 60,000 155mm howitzer shells, and an additional 130,000 122mm rockets to Ukraine, generating $364 million in revenue.

This ammunition transfer has reportedly left Pakistan’s key weapons systems, including M109 howitzers and Grad rocket systems, without adequate ammunition supplies.

Where does Ukraine get artillery shells?

Besides Pakistan, Ukraine receives artillery shells from the European Union, promising 2 million artillery shells by 2026, with two-thirds already delivered ahead of schedule.

These shells come from both EU domestic production and external suppliers, including South Korean and South African defense firms.

Czechia leads a significant independent multinational initiative, supplying over 1.5 million shells in 2024 and expecting to deliver 1.8 million more in 2025.

This effort, supported by around 20 countries including Canada, Norway, and Denmark, aims to address Ukraine’s ammunition shortages and has already delivered 400,000 shells this year.

Ukraine also produces a large number of artillery shells domestically, with current annual production around 2.5 million shells and plans to fully meet its artillery needs through domestic production by 2025.","Amid potential conflict with India, Pakistan is grappling with a critical shortage of artillery ammunition due to alleged large-scale exports to Ukraine and Israel, according to Indian media outlets, citing intelligence sources.

The GVN calls on world governments to address the threat of H5N1 avian influenza by enhancing surveillance, implementing biosecurity measures, and preparing for potential human-to-human transmission.

""Understanding the current landscape of H5N1 infections is critical for effective prevention and response,"" said Sten H. Vermund, MD, PhD, chief medical officer of the GVN and dean of the USF Health College of Public Health at the University of South Florida, USA. ""The virus’ ability to infect both animals and humans, combined with recent genetic changes, underscores the importance of proactive surveillance and rapid response measures.""

The outbreak has affected nearly 1000 dairy cow herds and resulted in more than 70 human cases, including the first confirmed death in the U.S. The U.S. poultry industry is at significant risk, particularly in areas with high-density farming and where personal protective practices may be lacking. The highly pathogenic influenza virus is now circulating in all 50 states and Canada, resulting in the loss or culling of more than 168 million poultry in the U.S. since 2022. While human-to-human transmission is not documented, experts warn that virus mutations and reassortments, or combining two flu viruses, could increase transmissibility.

""Genomic surveillance is pivotal in tracking viral evolution and informing response strategies,” said Marion Koopmans, DVM, PhD, center of excellence director at the GVN and head of the department of viroscience at Erasmus Medical Center, Netherlands. “Continued investment in surveillance at the human-animal interface, and immediate sharing of unusual field observations and sequence data is essential for researchers worldwide to monitor virus dynamics effectively."" Dr. Koopmans is a U.S. and Dutch National Academy of Sciences member. She is highly regarded for her research on emerging infectious diseases and as a scientific advisor to policymakers at national and international levels.

The GVN virologists underscore the need for improved pandemic preparedness, drawing on lessons learned from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and previous outbreaks. They advocate for a multi-faceted approach to pandemic preparedness, which includes:

Enhanced Surveillance: Continuous monitoring of animals, including testing of milk and wastewater and individuals working with infected animals, to track virus evolution that may lead to human-to human transmissibility. The GVN calls for more comprehensive state-wide testing in the U.S. and internationally. Faster Genomic Data Sharing: Accelerating the release of genomic data to track virus evolution and spatial transmission, fostering collaboration among global research networks. Improved Farm Biosecurity: Using personal protective equipment (PPE) and strict farm cleaning protocols to minimize human exposure and prevent virus spread. Preparedness Plans for the Roll-Out of Tests: Advocating for self-administered diagnostic tests for farm workers, supported by healthcare access for frontline medical staff, to enhance early detection. Strengthening Public Health Infrastructure: Increased funding and support for response mechanisms, particularly in high-risk regions, to better manage outbreaks. Investment in Phenotype Prediction from Genetic Data: Invest in predicting the phenotypes of avian influenza viruses from genetic data, as key traits are difficult to predict solely from genomic sequences. Investment in Rapid Vaccine Development: Encouraging the development and rapid deployment of vaccines for humans and animals, focusing on farm workers. Preparedness Plan for the Roll-Out of Vaccines and Therapeutics: Prepositioned clinical studies to rapidly assess the properties of emerging virus strains and potential treatments. Preparedness Plan to Allow for Rapid Clinical Studies: Focus on enabling rapid clinical studies to assess key properties of new pandemic strains, evaluate new vaccines and treatments, and support modeling efforts. International Collaboration: Supporting a coordinated global response to track data, share research, and prepare for emerging viral threats to reduce community vulnerabilities and improve response strategies.

""Initiatives should focus on enhancing biosecurity measures in agricultural settings and educating the public about safe handling of poultry products and potential risks associated with contact with infected animals,"" said Peter Palese, PhD, center of excellence director at the GVN and Horace W. Goldsmith Professor of the department of microbiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Dr. Palese is a world leader in influenza research and a U.S. National Academy of Sciences member.

“Given the growing circulation of H5N1 among mammals, the GVN calls for urgent efforts to understand and interrupt transmission in cattle through herd management and potential vaccination,” said Ab Osterhaus, DVM, PhD, center of excellence director at the GVN and founding director of the Center of Infection Medicine and Zoonosis Research at the University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Germany. “Strengthening surveillance at animal-human interfaces is crucial, as current monitoring efforts are insufficient to guide effective prevention strategies.” Dr. Osterhaus is internationally regarded for his work on animal viruses, SARS, MERS, and H5N1. He is a co-founder of the global One Health Community, and a Dutch and German National Academies of Sciences member.

While some surveillance of H5N1 has been carried out, the GVN highlights the lack of comprehensive testing and monitoring to assess the virus's spread and risks to public health.

“A robust nationwide monitoring system is essential to quickly detect, and quarantine affected animals and implement preventive measures to curb further spread and human infections,” said Elyse Stachler, PhD, member of the GVN and a research scientist at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, USA. “Further, we believe it is crucial to maintain trust and stakeholder buy-in for monitoring programs, particularly from farm workers.”

""We are advocating for community-driven strategies to ensure the successful implementation of vaccines, if necessary,” said Christian Bréchot, MD, PhD, vice chair of the board of directors and president emeritus of the GVN and director of the Microbiomes Institute and senior associate dean for research in global affairs in the USF Health Morsani College of Medicine, USA. “The situation with H5N1 demands heightened vigilance and collaboration across public health sectors. Early detection and robust surveillance are critical to prevent further spread.""

2025-04-24 21:48:20,2025-04-25 05:48:20 +08,https://hub.jhu.edu/magazine/2025/spring/ready-for-next-pandemic/,Are we ready for the next one? - Johns Hopkins,"From afar, the images look like clusters of tiny, multicolored dots strewn across paper. ""But the dots tell a story,"" immunologist Gigi Gronvall says about the two prints she framed and hung behind her desk at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.

One image shows the meticulous mapping of a London-based cholera outbreak in 1854 by British physician John Snow, whose work pinpointed the source of the sickness: a contaminated water pump in the Soho district. ""The prevailing theory at the time was that cholera spread through air,"" Gronvall says of Snow's groundbreaking work. ""But by gathering and mapping the data, Snow uncovered what we know to be true today—cholera spreads through contact with sewage and feces.""

Dots delineate a different infectious disease in the other, more complex image. There, arrows point up and down and sideways to pink, black, and blue circles, squares, and triangles, tracking viral and genetic material gathered in January 2020 from animals and stalls at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, China. A data visualization from a paper in the journal Cell (September 2024), the intricate markings reveal the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in the materials tested.

For Gronvall, a national security expert and senior scholar at the Center for Health Security, every study like this contributes to our body of scientific knowledge and reminds us, in this case, of a pandemic that led to the loss of more than 7 million people worldwide and trillions of dollars from the U.S. economy. People associate pandemics with the risks posed to human health, but they affect all aspects of society, she says. ""That's another reason we need to figure out how COVID started and what we can learn from it.""

Although the scientific community lacks consensus on whether COVID-19 originated in the Wuhan market or elsewhere, most scientists agree on another matter: We can expect more pandemics to come, owing to factors like climate change, mass migration, globalization, and human encroachment on wildlife and insect ecosystems. According to the center's director Tom Inglesby, who served in COVID-related advisory roles during the pandemic at the White House and in the Department of Health and Human Services, ""as temperatures change, people are moving around the world more rapidly than ever before … and intruding into ecosystems that used to be made up entirely of animals or insects."" This, in turn, creates opportunities for humans to get infected by new diseases and disease strains.

We can expect more pandemics to come, owing to factors like climate change, mass migration, globalization, and human encroachment on wildlife and insect ecosystems.

Another factor contributing to the likelihood of future pandemics are the concentrations of people living in megacities like Tokyo, Delhi, and Shanghai—to name three on a fast-growing list of cities with more than 10 million inhabitants. ""In some, people live incredibly close together without great sanitation, creating conditions for rapid spread, Inglesby says."" This happened last year, for instance, in the Democratic Republic of Congo's capital city Kinshasa, home to 17 million. There, a new, more contagious strain of a disease typically confined to rural areas, mpox, spread quickly. As a result, mpox now poses a threat not only to Kinshasa and the DRC but also the world, given the international flights going in and out of Kinshasa daily.

Over the past few decades, public health experts have watched infectious diseases spring up and evolve in surprising ways. That's a main reason the Center for Health Security was created in the first place, Inglesby says of the group that started in 1998 and has helped fight anthrax attacks and other bioterrorist threats, plus outbreaks of swine flu (H1N1), yellow fever, the Ebola and Zika viruses, and COVID-19.

Chances are, Inglesby says, experts won't be able to predict the next pandemic. It could be the bird flu ravaging U.S. cattle and poultry farms and infecting humans. It could be Zika or dengue fever, spread by mosquitoes, or another strain of influenza or coronavirus. ""No one really knows,"" he says. ""That's why we need to heed lessons from the past and prepare.""

Today, five years after COVID-19 spread to every continent on Earth, killed millions, and left roughly 400 million people with brain fog, breathing difficulties, and other symptoms of long COVID, Inglesby and others want to share and highlight the lessons learned to better prepare us for the next one that will inevitably occur.

Much of what they learned relates to the months leading up to the pandemic, ""a critical window of opportunity to do everything you can to contain the disease,"" Inglesby says. It involves decisions made at the executive level to combat a fast-spreading new virus, along with the timeline and manner in which officials share information and deploy countermeasures. It also involves the steps taken—or not taken—to contend with misinformation, which Gronvall, who teaches a class on the 1918 influenza virus that killed roughly 50 million, says we can count on transpiring in all pandemics.

""We'll be unpacking COVID for decades to come, with doctoral students and scholars poring over the data,"" Gronvall says. But with other pandemics on the horizon and COVID-19 continuing to mutate and cause lasting complications for people with and without chronic health conditions, experts say our country can't ignore what it learned and put its head in the sand.

Lesson 1: Prepare for the worst

On Jan. 1, 2020, epidemiologist Caitlin Rivers opened her inbox to find an email from the disease outbreak surveillance system ProMED, sent one minute before midnight.

""I have a bad feeling about this,"" the senior scholar at the Center for Health Security thought to herself, unintentionally channeling the famous Star Wars line.

The email reported a cluster of pneumonia-like cases of unknown cause in Wuhan, the sprawling capital city of central China's Hubei province, with a population of 11 million. Government officials in China hadn't yet reported the illnesses, but the low-tech email service ProMED had pieced together the news from active chatter on Weibo, a Chinese microblogging site.

Following ProMED's alert, media outlets worldwide started reporting on the strange sickness that turned out to be the novel coronavirus, COVID-19. But according to a report by the nonprofit research institution Project Information Literature, other stories dominated the U.S. news cycle, such as the Senate's impeachment trial of President Donald Trump and the tragic death of basketball star Kobe Bryant. ""Buried deeper in the news flow were reports of a mysterious flu spreading through China,"" the report reads. ""To the Americans who followed this story, this threat seemed safely distant.""

But faculty at the Center for Health Security saw clear warning signs and took swift action. In a Foreign Affairs article published on Jan. 31, 2020, Inglesby reminded the world of a tenet of public health: preparation is the key to an effective response, or, as Benjamin Franklin put it, ""By failing to prepare, you prepare to fail.""

According to Inglesby, as evidence mounted in January that the novel virus could morph into a pandemic, ""governments [worldwide] needed to act immediately by organizing for the worst-case-scenario and turning on all required systems""—a tall order that involves stockpiling diagnostic tests and protective equipment, readying hospitals and health care workers, preparing schools and teachers, and pooling resources and teams to develop a vaccine, therapeutic drugs like antivirals, and the manufacturing supply chain to produce and distribute these products in record time.

""If, for some miraculous reason, a pandemic didn't occur, then the extra work would leave us better prepared for the next one,"" Inglesby says.

Did the right people listen?

Some pockets of the federal government ""were quietly, extremely concerned and doing what they could to prepare,"" Inglesby says. But the government's main effort involved regulating travel from China, with passengers facing health screenings and potential quarantines.

More travel restrictions and bans followed, measures that experts say did little to prevent the spread of a virus already widely circulating. According to Inglesby, ""there should never have been an assumption that shutting down travel was a foolproof strategy. People were moving around the world all the time, and it was too late.""

George W. Bush ""A pandemic is a lot like a forest fire. If caught early it might be extinguished with limited damage. If allowed to smolder, undetected, it can grow to an inferno that can spread quickly beyond our ability to control it.""

In February 2020, as COVID cases multiplied, Inglesby attended a federal government meeting with health care system leaders. ""People were worried, but the meeting was more like a brainstorming session, instead of [an action plan] to start implementing specific steps to prepare hospitals and health care workers,"" he says.

Why no plan?

Pandemic preparedness had been a federal priority since 2005, when President George W. Bush devoted $7 billion to the cause. ""A pandemic is a lot like a forest fire,"" Bush told scientists at the National Institutes of Health. ""If caught early it might be extinguished with limited damage. If allowed to smolder, undetected, it can grow to an inferno that can spread quickly beyond our ability to control it.""

The Obama administration continued the work, taking an aggressive approach to the Ebola epidemic in 2014 and establishing a global health security directorate (through the White House's National Security Council), with a mission to prepare for and, if possible, prevent the next outbreak from turning into an epidemic or pandemic. The directorate [created a 69-page playbook, delineating how to guide government sectors through the complex work of fighting health threats.

In 2018, however, the Trump administration dismantled the directorate, claiming it was overstaffed and needed streamlining. Some staff members merged with other groups, while others left their positions, resulting in what the directorate's former leader Beth Cameron described as a diminished federal workforce devoted to monitoring and mitigating disease spread when COVID broke out.

""In a health security crisis, speed is essential,"" Cameron wrote in a March 13, 2020, op-ed for The Washington Post. ""When this new coronavirus emerged, there was no clear White House-led structure to oversee our response, and we lost valuable time.""

For a country as large as the U.S., creating a unit to oversee and coordinate global health security, with backing from senior government officials, is essential, experts say.

Inglesby agrees. Fighting a disease, he explains, ""involves tremendous coordination among not only government sectors but also private companies, nonprofits, and countries and organizations worldwide. It requires a structured, strategic approach.""

Lesson 2: Deliver information, not reassurance

Sometimes it makes sense to withhold information or quell fear with words of reassurance. When a friend suffers a loss, one might say, You'll get through it. Everything will be OK.

When it comes to a health threat, however, placating the public isn't the right strategy, experts say, and it's a lesson Inglesby and Rivers hope the country will take from the pandemic.

When it comes to a health threat, placating the public isn't the right strategy.

""The job of public health and political leaders should never be to overly reassure,"" Inglesby says. ""The job is to be factual and to provide maximum information to people and their families so they can make good judgments and lower their own risk of spread.""

But as Rivers explains in her recently released book, Crisis Averted: The Hidden Science of Fighting Outbreaks, senior officials downplayed the threat in the weeks before and after COVID became a pandemic. Alex Azar, the secretary of Health and Human Services at the time, announced at press briefings in late February that the risk to the American public remained low, while President Trump tweeted that the health threat had been ""inflamed ... far beyond what the facts would warrant.""

For Rivers and others monitoring the situation, ""the risk to the United States was anything but low … [yet went] unnoticed by most of the public and [was] actively denied by elected leaders,"" she says. That's why, when the U.S. declared a national emergency on March 13, the country was caught off guard.

Rivers, in Crisis Averted, stresses the importance of sharing information in a straightforward, timely manner. ""Clarity is a core tenet of public health messaging,"" she writes. Delivering bad news is difficult, and even the best health officials sometimes use ""opaque language"" and ""fuzzy jargon"" to soften the blow. The problem with these approaches, however, is that they don't ""give the listener any sense of the magnitude of the problem, or any direction about how concerned to be,"" she says.

Instead, people can more easily grasp information delivered in plain language with concrete examples, Rivers continues. This is a goal of public health messaging, but it mostly went unmet early in the pandemic.

As Inglesby explains it, ""the more we're in the mode of dismissing or downplaying the [situation] or of reassuring people, the more anxious they're going to get,"" and the more susceptible they'll be to misinformation.

Instead, people need specific information and evidence-based advice about their own circumstances. ""Some of us face higher risks than others, whether we're elderly or have an underlying condition, or we have a grandmother living with us,"" he continues. ""Everyone needs practical guidance.""

Lesson 3: Admit the unknown

""Science is slow,"" says Gigi Gronvall, sitting at her desk one morning in front of the images that remind her of the knowledge and benefits a society can reap when scientific breakthroughs occur. ""But science is far more effective than jumping to conclusions.""

During the pandemic, with schools and businesses closed and loved ones getting sick and dying, ""no one wanted to wait for information or be told what they could and couldn't do,"" she says. ""No one liked the disciplinarian,"" and public health became an easy target.

According to a study by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, 57% of leaders of local health departments surveyed nationwide became targets of harassment between March 2020 and January 2021, with droves of practitioners opting to leave their positions. ""Constrained by poor infrastructure, politics, and the backlash of the public they aimed to protect, public health officials described grappling with personal and professional disillusionment, torn between what they felt they should do and their limited ability to pursue it,"" the study reports. ""For some, the conflict was untenable.""

Why did public health become the scapegoat of a nation on lockdown?

From Inglesby's perspective, the backlash stemmed partly from an over-reliance on the CDC to make decisions beyond the scope of its expertise. ""The CDC is full of talented scientists, but as a health research agency, it wasn't set up to respond 24/7 to questions from the government and policymakers about matters of logistics and economic and societal tradeoffs, such as whether to close schools and businesses and cancel events,"" he says. ""These are political and civil-society decisions that require a collaborative effort, with people representing various interests weighing in to determine the best course of action.""

Founded in 1946 to stop the spread of malaria, the CDC serves as the nation's leading public health agency, responsible for providing scientific guidance on the spread of infectious diseases. The Atlanta-based agency is staffed with epidemiologists, virologists, and other experts in disease control and prevention, not in areas like economic growth and K-12 education. When asked, in the summer of 2020, to provide guidance on the return to school for students and teachers, the CDC submitted a report to the Trump administration indicating that the move would pose risks to a country experiencing 40,000 to 100,000 new cases of COVID every day—and to a nation with an already-overwhelmed health system.

The administration pushed back on the report, and many blamed the CDC for keeping kids out of school. According to Inglesby, however, the CDC was simply doing what it was set up to do: offering guidance on the matter, as it relates to curtailing harm done by the virus. ""It became all too easy to blame [the agency] for a decision that needed experts in additional areas to weigh in,"" he says.

The backlash on public health also stemmed from the learning curve involved in combatting a wily new virus behaving in unpredictable ways, experts say. ""We didn't have all of the answers, and new scientific evidence was emerging all the time,"" Inglesby explains. ""A study would be completed or half-completed. A new variant would be identified, and the message to the public would change.""

One example: face masks.

Early in the pandemic, scarce information existed on whether masks could stave off COVID-19, so officials didn't suggest wearing them. That changed, however, as data revealed that masks slow down the disease transmission, leading the CDC to alter its guidance. ""Some political leaders and members of the public accused the CDC of reversing positions and [lacking competence],"" Inglesby says, referring to the allegations of ""flip-flopping"" that resounded nationwide. ""What was missing from the conversation, however, is that changes are inevitable in an agency devoted to scientific research—that's the nature of what researchers do."" They gather evidence and conduct studies, shifting recommendations as they narrow in on the truth.

How public health officials present information makes a difference, experts suggest. ""The public doesn't want to hear heavily scientific explanations, just as they don't want to be told everything will be OK, without any specifics,"" Inglesby says.

Gronvall recommends an approach comparable to a police chief speaking at a press briefing. ""The key is to strike a cadence that reinforces a message along the lines of, 'This is what we know right now, and it's why we recommend X precaution. When we learn more and if the guidance changes, we'll update you right away.'""

This way, the message comes across not as a command from all-knowing experts but as an open sharing of evidence-based information for people to use—or not use—to make decisions. The choice stays with the individual, who becomes an informed partner in protecting their health and that of their loved ones.

Lesson 4: Get ahead of misinformation

Tara Sell, a senior scholar at the Center for Health Security, specializes in misinformation—and its ability to turn people away from life-saving health advice. During the pandemic, she mined social media and networking forums for misleading posts about everything from face masks and social distancing to vaccines and anti-viral treatments.

""Misinformation eroded millions of people's trust in public health,"" Sell says. ""It will take a lot of work to rebuild it.""

From her research, she discovered that misinformation stemmed in part from partisan politics. ""Whether to wear a mask, whether to get a vaccine—those choices became tied to people's political identity, which wasn't good for the public and brought consequences that continue today,"" Sell says. Since the pandemic, for example, at least 30 states have passed laws to limit public health authority, and health officials in many of those states can no longer issue mask mandates or close schools.

Tara Sell Senior scholar, Center for Health Security ""Whether to wear a mask, whether to get a vaccine—those choices became tied to people's political identity, which wasn't good for the public and brought consequences that continue today.""

Gronvall says that partisan media outlets fueled misinformation by giving airtime to anchors who contradicted health guidance and sowed doubt among viewers. On Tucker Carlson Tonight, for instance, Carlson spoke out repeatedly against vaccines, going so far as to compare President Biden's vaccination plan to the lethal and torturous medical procedures imposed by the Nazis during the Holocaust. In 2021, he referred to the vaccine as ""the greatest scandal in my lifetime, by far,"" and openly discouraged his roughly 3 million viewers from getting vaccinated.

The media's influence on health compliance during the pandemic hasn't been thoroughly studied, Gronvall says, and she worries the breeding ground for misinformation still plagues us. ""As a society, we haven't addressed the financial forces that went into dismantling public health messages and dissuading people from protecting their own interests,"" she says.

Sell agrees, adding: ""Misinformation is a predictable part of health emergencies, so much so that we'll know what to look for the next time around.""

From her research, Sell noticed striking similarities among misinformation spread during COVID and other crises. For example, tales of infertility nearly always crop up, with reports of, say, a vaccine preventing women from conceiving or delivering a healthy baby. False claims abound about health treatments that use children as guinea pigs, along with conspiracy theories about a government's ill intentions or a pharmaceutical or tech company's financial greed.

Society's most susceptible members often fall prey to the messages. ""Pregnancy and early motherhood, for instance, are vulnerable times for women,"" Sell says. ""You've got a lot of things you don't know, and so you search the internet for information and find a lively audience talking about things that speak to your situation. You get hooked.""

To share what she learned, Sell and her colleagues worked with the CDC to produce a playbook for directors of local health departments to use to identify and address misinformation. The playbook includes instruction on things like how to address rumors, frame messages, and connect with communities to build trust and partnerships.

""As health scholars, we tend to look at situations through the lens of case numbers and infection rates, but other people's values also matter,"" she says. ""We need to step out of our bubbles. We need to listen with empathy.""

The next one

During the 1918 influenza pandemic, as the deadly disease ravaged one battalion after another on the battlefields of World War I, governments went to great lengths to hide the circumstances, fearing the news would lower morale and lead enemy forces to take advantage of the depleted troops.

In the U.S., President Woodrow Wilson signed into law the Espionage Act of 1917, preventing anyone from documenting or discussing anything that would disadvantage the country's military position. The following year, Wilson passed the Sedition Act, a more stringent measure that made it illegal—and punishable by a 20-year imprisonment—for anyone to write, publish, or utter a word that might hinder the U.S. war effort. This, of course, meant keeping quiet about the strange illness killing millions on U.S. soil and across the Atlantic.

Perhaps not surprisingly, Wilson's suppression of free speech fostered a breeding ground for misinformation about a virus that became known, incorrectly, as the ""Spanish flu."" A neutral country in World War I, Spain was among the only countries reporting deaths and illnesses caused by the virus. Word spread that the virus originated there.

Studies reveal that ""the 'Spanish flu' most likely started at a military camp in Kansas,"" says Gronvall, who teaches a class on the 1918 pandemic at the Bloomberg School of Public Health.

Gronvall says her students chime in regularly with stories about COVID—and similarities between the pandemic they experienced firsthand and the one they're learning about in class. She talks to students about rising threats like H5N1, a matter that weighs heavily on those at the Center for Health Security.

At the time of this writing, H5N1, a strain of influenza spread by wild birds and highly contagious and lethal in poultry, continues to wreak havoc on the U.S. poultry and cattle industries, having infected commercial and backyard poultry flocks in all 50 states and cattle herds in at least 16, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the CDC. Seventy humans have tested positive, including veterinarians and others with no known contact with infected cows or birds, ""which suggests we're missing cases,"" Gronvall says. Mammals are also contracting the disease, with H5N1 showing up in red foxes, racoons, bobcats, and even domestic cats, among other animals.

""I'm chronically worried,"" Inglesby says about H5N1. ""There's no evidence right now that it can spread from human to human but that could change in ways that allow it to transmit efficiently between people.""

If that happens, the outcome could be disastrous. ""The lethality of H5N1 infection in a new epidemic would depend on the exact strain, but in the past, there was very high lethality in humans infected with this virus,"" Inglesby explains.

Experts say that the U.S. needs to prepare not only for H5N1 but also for the slew of other infectious diseases with epidemic or pandemic potential. ""We live in an age of pandemics and have to count on an increase in infectious disease outbreaks,"" Inglesby says. ""We have to create [the infrastructure] to develop medicines and vaccines rapidly and surveillance systems that can make quick diagnoses.""

No such pandemic response system exists right now, and it can't happen by the hands of a single country—it requires a global effort, Inglesby indicates.

Since the bird flu broke out in the U.S. in 2022, world experts have been watching what many considered a lackluster response by the Biden administration to contain the disease. Diagnostic testing for H5N1 is in short supply, and in many states, testing cattle isn't mandatory. Infected but asymptomatic cattle can go unnoticed, and farmers who fear economic or other repercussions (roughly half of U.S. farmworkers are undocumented immigrants) may be reluctant to report sick cattle and unable to seek medical care if they fall ill themselves, owing to a lack of health insurance.

""The country needs to remove barriers that get in the way of farmers reporting illness or seeking help,"" Inglesby says. In 2024, the U.S. Department of Agriculture ""implemented a financial incentive for farmers who report illnesses. That's a step in the right direction.""

Still, the number of cattle and humans with H5N1 probably far surpasses the number of cases reported, Inglesby suspects. And the coordination it will take to combat a virus that affects both humans and animals is ""much more complicated than fighting COVID because of the collaboration it takes between the USDA and CDC,"" he says.

A vaccine for the strain of H5N1 running rampant across the U.S. doesn't yet exist, though pharmaceutical companies such as Moderna and Pfizer are working on it. Roughly five million doses of an older vaccine that targets other bird flu strains exist, but those haven't been made available to farmers, who face the most risk.

""Did we learn nothing from COVID?"" Gronvall wonders.

Right now, efforts are underway to restructure, shrink, and limit the powers of the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, the CDC, and practically all government agencies, with budget freezes halting medical research and public health initiatives. ""This is incredibly worrisome for several reasons,"" Inglesby says, ""including what it's doing to public health budgets at the state level, which rely on money from the CDC.""

Gronvall says the abrupt slashes to research and public health budgets, combined with cuts to services that advance and protect human health, are arriving as our country and world face an unprecedented health threat, with more to come.

""We don't know enough about H5N1 or other viruses with epidemic or pandemic potential, and we need to learn,"" she says, gesturing to the pair of images on the wall behind her, the two emblems of acumen gained through data collected and analyzed. ""The only way is through research.""

Emily Gaines Buchler is a senior writer at Johns Hopkins University.","""In some, people live incredibly close together without great sanitation, creating conditions for rapid spread, Inglesby says.""
Over the past few decades, public health experts have watched infectious diseases spring up and evolve in surprising ways.
""No one liked the disciplinarian,"" and public health became an easy target.
Why did public health become the scapegoat of a nation on lockdown?
""As a society, we haven't addressed the financial forces that went into dismantling public health messages and dissuading people from protecting their own interests,"" she says.","['experts', 'health', 'public', 'cdc', 'ready', 'inglesby', 'disease', 'virus', 'pandemic', 'information', 'spread']",China,Kansas,Tokyo,United States,Pandemic Preparedness and Emerging Infectious Disease Threats,negative,"The article focuses on lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic, current failures in preparedness for future pandemics, rising threats from diseases like H5N1, and the erosion of public health infrastructure and trust.

2025-04-19 18:45:07,2025-04-20 02:45:07 +08,https://sph.cuny.edu/life-at-sph/news/2024/01/11/universal-coronavirus-vaccine-could-save-billions-of-dollars/,Having a universal coronavirus vaccine that targets all coronaviruses in advance of the next coronavirus pandemic can save up to 7 million hospitalizations and 2 million deaths even when it is the only intervention being implemented and its efficacy is as low as 10%.,"A new study suggests once developed, having a universal vaccine in advance of the next coronavirus epidemic/pandemic can save up to 7 million hospitalizations and 2 million deaths even when it is the only intervention being implemented and its efficacy is as low as 10%.

What if scientists had developed a universal coronavirus vaccine in the years prior to 2020 so that it was available at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic? A universal coronavirus vaccine targets parts of the virus that are common to either many or all coronaviruses, thereby offering some degree of protection against a range of strains. A new study suggests if such a vaccine were available at the start of the pandemic, it could have saved millions of lives, prevented suffering, and saved billions of dollars in direct medical and other costs until the strain-specific (i.e., SARS-CoV-2) vaccine went through the entire development, testing, and emergency use authorization process that lasted 10 months.

In the study, researchers from the Public Health Informatics, Computational and Operations Research (PHICOR) group, the CUNY Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy (CUNY SPH), and the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) show that having a universal vaccine at the start of the pandemic would have had substantial health and economic benefits under almost all scenarios tested. The study was published Jan. 11 in the Lancet’s eClinicalMedicine.

In order to determine the value of investing in developing and stockpiling a universal coronavirus vaccine, the team developed a computational model that simulated the entire U.S. population, the introduction and spread of a novel coronavirus like SARS-CoV-2 in 2020 and the resulting health (e.g., infections, hospitalizations) and economic (e.g., direct medical costs, productivity losses) outcomes. The experiments simulated what would happen if a universal coronavirus vaccine was available at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Vaccinating with a universal coronavirus vaccine as a standalone intervention (e.g., no face mask use or social distancing) was cost-saving even when its efficacy was as low as 10% and only 10% of the U.S. population received the vaccine. For example, when a universal coronavirus vaccine has 10% efficacy, vaccinating a quarter of the U.S. population within two months of the start of the pandemic averts an average of 14.6 million infections and saves over $27 billion in direct medical costs. Such low vaccine coverage at the start of the pandemic could occur if a vaccine were only made available to certain high-risk subpopulations (e.g., 65 years and older, those with weakened immune systems, frontline workers), similar to the approach when mRNA vaccines became available in December 2020.

“COVID-19 was the third major and serious coronavirus epidemic or pandemic following SARS in 2002 and MERS in 2012, thus, we should anticipate a fourth coronavirus outbreak within the next decade or so,” says Peter J. Hotez, MD, PhD, dean of Baylor’s National School of Tropical Medicine and co-director of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development. “A universal vaccine is cost-effective and cost-saving and a priority for advancement.”

A universal coronavirus vaccine was also shown to be highly cost-effective even if a more specific and more efficacious vaccine came to market. For example, the study shows if it takes four months or longer for a strain-specific vaccine to reach the market, using a universal vaccine was still cost cost-saving. In a scenario where a strain-specific vaccine has 90% efficacy but is unavailable for two months after the start of the pandemic, the results from the model show that vaccinating only 10% of the population with a universal vaccine that has 10% efficacy at the start of the pandemic can save over $2 billion in societal costs (e.g., direct medical costs and productivity losses from absenteeism). Given the time required to develop a strain-specific vaccine during a pandemic to match circulating strains of the virus, this highlights the importance of having a universal vaccine readily available as a stopgap.

“Our study shows the importance of giving as many people as possible in a population at least some degree of immune protection as soon as possible,” explains Bruce Y. Lee, MD, MBA, executive director of PHICOR and professor at CUNY SPH. “Having a universal vaccine developed, stockpiled, and ready to go in the event of a pandemic could be a game-changer even if a more specific vaccine could be developed three to four months later.”

Generally, results from the model found that a universal vaccine would end up saving money if the cost to get a person vaccinated (e.g., cost of the vaccine itself, distribution, administration, storage, research, and development) is as high as $10,390 from a societal perspective.

Instead, all six flu pandemics that have occurred since 1889 emerged in spring and summer months. And that got some University of Texas at Austin scientists wondering, why is that?

Based on their computational model that mimics viral spread during flu season, graduate student Spencer Fox and his colleagues found strong evidence that the late timing of flu pandemics is caused by two opposing factors: Flu spreads best under winter environmental and social conditions. However, people who are infected by one flu virus can develop temporary immune protection against other flu viruses, slowing potential pandemics. Together, this leaves a narrow window toward the end of the flu season for new pandemics to emerge.

They report their findings today in PLOS Computational Biology.

Each of the six flu pandemics since 1889 emerged in the Northern Hemisphere after the flu season (dashed lines), rather than during the peak of flu season. An average of several flu seasons is represented by a curve, with a peak in activity typically between late December and early March. Spencer J. Fox

The researchers’ model assumes that people infected with seasonal flu gain long-term immunity to seasonal flu and short-term immunity to emerging pandemic viruses. The model incorporates data on flu transmission from the 2008-2009 flu season and correctly predicted the timing of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.

Using the supercomputers at the Texas Advanced Computing Center, the scientists used their model to run thousands of simulations in which new pandemic viruses emerged at different points throughout the flu season. They found that the combination of winter conditions and cross-virus immunity indeed led to spring and summer pandemics.

“We don’t know when or where the next deadly flu pandemic will arise,” says Lauren Ancel Meyers, a professor in the Department of Integrative Biology and principal investigator of the study. “However, the typical flu season leaves a wake of immunity that prevents new viruses from spreading. Our study shows that this creates a narrow, predictable window for pandemic emergence in the spring and early summer, which can help public health agencies to detect and respond to new viral threats.”

Future research may focus on more precisely characterizing the cross-strain immunity that impedes pandemic emergence during the normal flu season. Scientists may also explore how these pandemic risk patterns manifest in the Southern Hemisphere and tropical regions.

The charges carry potential sentences of more than a decade in prison.

The fraud scheme targeted two programs meant to feed hungry children, which were funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture but administered by the state of Minnesota. The system relied on nonprofit groups called “sponsors” to be its watchdogs. They were supposed to oversee individual kitchens and feeding sites and make sure they were not inflating the number of children they served.

When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, the federal government flooded money into the program — trying to reach children who were out of school and therefore unable to rely on school lunches. The government also relaxed oversight, putting even more trust in the watchdogs.

In this case, prosecutors said, one of those watchdogs went bad.

Ms. Bock ran a sponsor nonprofit called Feeding Our Future. Prosecutors said she had conspired with dozens of people to set up 250 nonexistent feeding operations around Minnesota and used her oversight power to hide that network from the government. By law, Ms. Bock’s nonprofit got a cut of the money. Prosecutors said it had eventually totaled $18 million.

Many of the fake operations submitted invoices for implausibly large numbers of children: Mr. Said’s operation, for instance, said it had fed 6,000 a day, more than all the children in its ZIP code. In another instance, a man said he was feeding 5,000 children a night — from a location that turned out to be a second-floor apartment.","They were supposed to oversee individual kitchens and feeding sites and make sure they were not inflating the number of children they served.

Despite publication of numerous pandemic planning recommendations, little or no specific guidance about the types of items and quantities of supplies needed has been available. The primary purpose of this report is to detail the approach of 1 healthcare system in building a cache of supplies to be used for patient care during the next influenza pandemic. These concepts may help guide the actions of other healthcare systems.

To help our healthcare system prepare for a pandemic, a multidisciplinary group of experts drawn from within the VA system were empaneled to help bridge the gap between policy and procedure. Among the most challenging tasks was the development of a prioritized list detailing supplies and the essential quantities that should be stockpiled. This report aims to provide detailed example of 1 healthcare system’s approach to building a cache of supplies for the next influenza pandemic and to help identify critical gaps in knowledge that must be addressed for adequate preparedness.

In December 2005, the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), which has governance over the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States, directed its medical centers to make detailed pandemic influenza preparations. This directive was ushered in by a guidance document ( 7 ) that broadly defined the goals and expectations of individual VA medical centers and provided a framework for planning and preparedness. Steps taken by medical centers, including decisions about stockpiling items, were determined by leaders at the local level.

Numerous guidance documents call for stockpiling certain supplies that might be needed to care for influenza patients during a pandemic ( 3 – 6 ). Just-in-time supply chains and standard operating procedures may be insufficient to meet demand as the number of cases increase ( 3 – 6 ). Healthcare systems have been challenged to determine the medical supplies that should be procured. Despite publication of numerous pandemic planning recommendations, little or no guidance has been available about this topic.

Preparations for the next influenza pandemic have captured a remarkable amount of attention, effort, and fiscal funding since 2004, when the scientific and public health communities became increasingly concerned about the emergence of a novel influenza virus (H5N1) infecting humans in Eurasia ( 1 ). Many feared the occurrence of an outbreak on the scale of the 1918–19 pandemic, during which one third of the world’s population became infected and as many as 100 million persons died ( 2 )

Many items purchased for the cache had expiration dates. Although most items had multiple-year shelf lives, some shelf lives were as short as 1 year. The variability of manufacturer-ascribed expiration dates and other reasons for supply rotation led to the recognition that the cache would become a dynamic component of medical system supplies. Items would need to be inspected regularly and rotated through the storage facility on a regular basis. To meet this need, a human resource commitment of 1 full-time employee equivalent would be necessary for logistics management of the inventory. Duties of this person would include inspecting the inventory, assisting with incoming and outgoing deliveries, rotating items into the routinely used supplies of the medical system to ensure use before expiration, and prodding physical security for the inventory. This person would also be charged with developing and maintaining a plan for transportation and deployment of the inventory in the event of a pandemic. In addition, each medical facility would also be required to provide an employee to help manage the inventory and who would report to the cache in the event of a pandemic.

Storage of supplies proved to be among the most resource-intensive components of cache-building. Although initial wishes were to store a cache on the campus of each medical center, the space necessary was too large for most VA institutions to accommodate. After extensive discussion and careful analysis of options, a decision was made to store pandemic supplies in a 10,000–square foot, temperature-controlled, leased warehouse. Quoted costs for space ranged from $10 to $14 per square foot per year ($100,000–$140,000 per year for 10,000 square feet). The recommended location was near an airport to ensure efficient transport of supplies either by tractor trailer or by air cargo. A back-up emergency generator was included to maintain air-conditioning in the event of a power failure.

Purchasing items in large quantity through a prenegotiated agreement enabled a discount off retail prices. However, despite this contract, back-order delays occurred (and would be expected to occur during a pandemic) for several key items. One supplier of personal protective equipment indicated that shipment would be delayed by 6–9 months, affirming predictions of shortages of personal protective equipment. This experience underscored making purchases well in advance of the date when the items were expected to be used for patient care.

The calculated cost of purchasing all essential items for a population of 500,000 amounted to ≈$11 million. Despite efforts to prioritize the items into 3 categories, the calculated cost of category A items far exceeded the amount of funds available. The PIPC debated the best approach and recommended that the available funds be used to purchase a percentage of category A items and that future funds would be used to purchase additional category A items and decreasing percentages of category B and category C items. For example, the funds available at that time were sufficient to purchase 12.5% of category A items. Upon the availability of future funding, perhaps an additional 7.5% of category A items would be purchased along with 5% of category B items and 2.5% of category C items.

Because limited financial resources were available, the PIPC was asked to establish a prioritization scheme. Although every item on the list was considered important, each was subcategorized into purchase priority A, B, and C; A was the most important ( Table 5 ). To arrive at the category level, the following scheme was used. Category A was personal protective equipment, basic life-support items (intravenous fluids, oxygen), and first-line antimicrobial drugs. Category B was second-line antimicrobial drugs, ventilator supplies, sedatives, nebulizers and β-agonists, home care packs, and morgue packs. Category C was disposable ventilators, proton pump inhibitors, and vasopressors. Antiviral medications and vaccines were not included in this list because it was expected that the VA would acquire and maintain a centralized cache of oseltamivir, and vaccine availability and effectiveness were unknown.

We estimated the per patient–encounter needs by staff category ( Table 3 ) and the number of healthcare worker contacts per patient, per day, for each type of healthcare setting ( Table 4 ). In a similar fashion, supply needs were estimated per patient encounter (for outpatients) or per patient-day of care (for inpatients) ( Table 3 ). The ascertained supply and medication needs were combined in a spreadsheet to estimate the needs of each facility and for our network. Spreadsheet formulas enabled the needs of each facility or healthcare system to be easily modified by using the number of individually enrolled patients ( Table 5 ).

Among the gaps in knowledge regarding pandemic influenza is the mechanism of human-to-human transmission of influenza ( 10 ). The Institute of Medicine recommendation ( 10 ) to consider all transmission routes probable and consequential was accepted. Precautions against standard, contact, droplet, and airborne transmission ( 13 ) were incorporated into the plan. We assumed that sole use of disposable N95 respirators would be prohibitively expensive or otherwise not possible because of global shortages ( 14 ). Instead, we decided that staff with prolonged periods of exposure (e.g., physicians, nurses, respiratory technicians, selected housekeepers) would be issued and that just-in-time fit testing, a reusable elastomeric half-face mask with 3 sets of filters, would be used. We estimated that we would need ≈1,000 of these masks and reusable goggles for each 50,000 patients served (on the basis of the size and catchment population of one of our medium-size facilities). Disposable masks would be limited to the beginning of the pandemic and to personnel with infrequent exposure. Using these principles, we calculated the workload, supplies, and medication required to care for typical influenza patients. Accordingly, estimates were produced for the average needs of influenza patients requiring >1 types of services, including outpatient, inpatient medical ward, or ICU settings with or without mechanical ventilation.

Length-of-stay figures were needed to calculate supply needs because resource use is more accurately calculated by patient-days of care instead of number of admissions. We used some of the assumptions made by FluSurge version 2.0 as follows: average length of stay (not in ICU) of 5 days per patient, an additional 10 days for those requiring an ICU stay, and an average time receiving mechanical ventilation of 10 days.

Once the number of patients was established, we used the US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) 1918-scale pandemic model ( 11 ) ( Table 2 ) and FluSurge version 2.0 software ( 12 ) ( Table 2 ) to estimate the number of persons who would be expected to seek care, be hospitalized, admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), or be treated with mechanical ventilation ( Table 2 ). The only modification to the DHHS model was in the proportion of the population likely to contract influenza. The model calls for 40% disease incidence for children, 20% for healthy adults, and a somewhat higher incidence for elderly persons. Therefore, 25% seemed like a reasonable number for the VA, an institution that does not provide healthcare to children. We based calculations on the population likely to request care, not on the physical or personnel capacity of our facilities. It was our assertion that physical capacity would be increased and standards of healthcare would be lowered, as necessary, during a pandemic to permit serving as many people as possible. We acknowledge that alternate sites of care might become available during a pandemic. However, we viewed this possibility as too unpredictable to include in our assumption model.

Most tools estimate effect on healthcare facilities based on population size, but we were dealing with a subpopulation of veterans that may seek care at the VA facilities or at any other community resource. In addition, VA facilities may open their doors to nonveterans during a pandemic. We decided, arbitrarily, to define our universe of patients as the number of individually enrolled persons who sought care at VA facilities during the previous fiscal year. This figure enabled us to calculate system and facility needs in a standardized fashion.

PIPC members recognized that the uncertainty surrounding a pandemic would require a series of assumptions and that any assumption would include some guesswork. To minimize errors, available historical data and guidance from governmental institutions were used to estimate the effect on our healthcare system.

The PIPC agreed on a set of basic philosophical principles that guided our pandemic preparation efforts. During a pandemic, the first priority would be to provide the best possible care to patients while maximizing healthcare worker safety. Essential and relatively affordable patient care supplies and medications meant for basic life support (e.g., intravenous fluids, oxygen, and antimicrobial drugs) would be purchased first, and more expensive, technologically advanced life support (e.g., mechanical ventilation) equipment would be purchased when additional funds become available. This approach to balancing utilitarian and deontologic decision making is discussed elsewhere ( 8 , 9 ). Vaccines and antiviral drugs would not be relied upon as primary means of intervention because their availability and effectiveness during a pandemic remain uncertain ( 4 , 10 ). Although plans to acquire, store, distribute, and administer these countermeasure supplies would be made when possible and necessary, we acknowledge that these plans would not be relied upon as primary countermeasures in most pandemic scenarios.

The VISN 8 leadership appointed a multidisciplinary team to a pandemic influenza planning committee (PIPC) ( Table 1 ) that was tasked to ensure a coordinated and consistent planning and response effort across the VISN. Although the committee had many responsibilities, the focus of this report is limited to the framework developed to estimate supply needs.

The 1,400 medical facilities in the national VA healthcare system are decentralized into 23 Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs), each representing a specific region of the nation. The concepts described in this report are based on actions taken by staff in VISN 8, which includes southern Georgia, most of Florida, and all of Puerto Rico, and provides healthcare for ≈500,000 veterans. Regional network offices help integrate the activities of the medical facilities included in each VISN. Local medical center leaders are primarily responsible for the activities at each hospital and its affiliated outpatient clinics.

Discussion and Recommendations

Despite the numerous uncertainties posed by pandemic influenza, the types and quantities of essential items that should be stockpiled can be estimated by using a reasoned approach. What is offered in this report is a method to calculate the components of a stockpile by using assumptions that are drawn from previous pandemics. This method enables modification of figures, making them scalable and adaptable to any size population. By following the logic of the proposed calculations, it should be possible to modify the assumptions and other figures as needed for almost any community or healthcare system.

Perhaps the most important limitation with this method is a reliance on assumptions. No one knows what the next pandemic will bring. We believe that it is better to plan for a more severe event that will leave the system overprepared than to risk being underprepared. However, this approach may be viewed by some as unnecessary or too expensive. A stratified purchase plan, in which a fraction of essential items is purchased periodically, is recommended on the basis of availability of funds. Some may favor purchase of all items in 1 category before moving to the next category.

The formation and management of a pandemic supply cache would require considerable human and financial resources. The level of commitment may be viewed by some healthcare systems as too costly, especially in an era of economic instability and healthcare system instability likely requiring major reform. Some of the more resource-intensive components of the proposed approach, such as the storage of items in a staffed central facility, were facilitated by the large size of our healthcare system and available resources. Achieving a similar product in the private sector, where healthcare systems are typically much smaller than those in the federally managed VA, might require a partnership among multiple healthcare systems in a region.

One of the most common and widely held misconceptions we encountered was the notion that a healthcare system could be stressed to the breaking point, such that a large surge of patients could eventually render a hospital unable to function. It is our view that in reality, healthcare systems are designed to operate in a graded fashion. Although it is theoretically conceivable that a catastrophe could cause hospitals to cease functioning, it is much more likely that they will continue functioning, even under the most ominous circumstances (15–17). What will change is the standard of care that is delivered; many patients may have access to less resources than would normally be available (18,19). Stockpiling supplies should help prepare for a downgraded level of care that becomes inevitable as resources are increasingly stretched. A key message taken from our experiences was that supplies need to be ordered far in advance of a pandemic to avoid major problems with back orders and supply shortfalls.

The estimated cost of purchasing all supplies and medications needed to provide healthcare to a population of 500,000 during a wave of an influenza pandemic, including negotiated and contracted prices, was ≈$11 million, or approximately half that amount if one only considers purchasing priority A items. This amount is considerably higher than the amount estimated elsewhere (20). This difference may stem from the way we calculated our needs: we did not assume that we could reach a full capacity. Instead, we attempted to estimate the population that is likely to seek care and assumed that under the dire circumstances of a severe pandemic facilities would decrease standards of care, open alternate sites of care, and creatively care for those patients who came for treatment. We also did not assume that we would have a shortage of personnel to care for these patients. Through altered standards of care; emergency privileging and cross-training of healthcare workers, volunteers, and other persons willing and able to care for our patients, a temporary and substantially changed workforce would be expected to emerge.

Numerous gaps in knowledge were encountered. The mechanisms of human-to-human transmission of seasonal and pandemic influenza are poorly understood. Numerous articles have discussed the types of respiratory protection that should be considered and stockpiled (6,10) for healthcare workers. However, there has never been a definitive, prospective clinical trial that shows whether respirators are superior to surgical masks. Translational research funding to answer these questions should become a priority.

This report is an attempt to describe the challenges our healthcare system faced when preparing for an influenza pandemic. By no means are all the answers, or even the questions, reported here. Additional work is needed to further identify important questions and appropriate solutions. We hope these concepts will help guide the decisions of other healthcare systems as they work through this challenging task.","Numerous guidance documents call for stockpiling certain supplies that might be needed to care for influenza patients during a pandemic ( 3 – 6 ).
After extensive discussion and careful analysis of options, a decision was made to store pandemic supplies in a 10,000–square foot, temperature-controlled, leased warehouse.

Bird flu has affected dairy herds in 17 US states from North Carolina to California and has just been reported in cats. So far, it is reluctant to spread among people, although people can both get it and give it to animals.

Between 500 and 1,000 people globally are now dying every week from COVID. This winter, healthcare in much of the developed world has been hit by a combination of flu, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and COVID, leading to rising hospital admissions and deaths. We don’t have real control of any of these diseases.

In the last 60 years there have been four pandemics – a million dead from flu in 1968-69; 774 people dead from Sars-1 in 2002; 7 million dead from COVID since 2021; 280 dead from mpox since 2022.

I’m not sure we are more ready for the next pandemic.

We are not controlling the diseases we can control. There have been cases of polio in children in Gaza and in young adults in New York. This is a disease that was nearly eliminated from the world.

Children are hospitalised with measles every day in wealthy countries. Many are very ill, some are left with brain damage and some die. Measles also came close to extinction but came back as vaccination rates fell.

Cotton Mather (a Puritan cleric) and Lady Mary Wortley Montagu introduced smallpox variolation (an early, crude form of vaccination) to the west in 1721.

The practice attracted controversy because of its danger and the immorality of deliberately infecting people. Anti-vaccination arguments have continued to run ahead of the evidence of benefit ever since. Partly as a result, we have not yet controlled measles or polio.

There are vaccine side-effects, but these are much rarer and much less serious than those from the diseases. Vaccine safety is closely monitored and for good reasons – vaccines are given to people who are not ill.

Other simple measures were described by US Supreme Court justice Samuel Alito in 2020 as “previously unimaginable restrictions on individual liberty”.

There were cases during the peak of the COVID pandemic, where people who wore masks in public were harassed. Lockdowns and other restrictions on mobility were much more intrusive, but there is clear evidence that both worked and people and economies benefited as a result.

Public health measures did control Sars-1, mainly because governments, public health teams and doctors got on top of it very quickly. They used the same approaches that have been used to control other severe outbreaks, including strong restrictions on movement.

Neither mpox nor COVID was controlled. In both cases, global responses were late, underfunded and slow and became the target of political attacks. In the case of mpox, it was initially thought, wrongly, only to affect gay men, and hence of limited significance to others. As a result, not enough was done to halt its spread early in the outbreak.

Many unscrupulous people took advantage of the COVID pandemic, selling useless remedies for the condition, such as bleach, hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin.

There were also campaigns promoting conspiracy theories about the origin of the virus, such as suggesting a deliberate release of an engineered virus, the purposes of the public health measures and the effects of the vaccine.

This made it very hard to deliver serious public health messages and interventions, especially to marginalised groups such as immigrants, poorer people or people with literacy challenges.

Experts are planning for pandemic bird flu, which may happen, but I fear that the next big one will be a virus we have yet to meet. It is critical that we have flexible plans to deal with something besides flu. Unfortunately, a combination of war and toxic politics is reducing our ability to develop and deliver these plans.

To deliver anything effectively, we need to strengthen global public health, including the World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which are both under severe threat to their future funding, as the US shrinks and rearranges its own agencies, and with Argentina’s plans to leave WHO.

Grounds for hope

There are grounds for hope. One remarkable outcome of the COVID pandemic was the vaccines. Most people in public health and vaccine studies thought it would be three years, at best, before a vaccine became available. It will be crucial to maintain the research base and the tools for fairer mass production of new vaccines for whatever happens next.

Two innovative UK studies – Recover and React – also showed a way forward for future pandemics. Recover provided a frame for doing quick drug trials on sick people, including finding that a cheap, safe medicine called dexamethasone worked to treat severe COVID, and provides a model for future clinical care for new infections.

React monitored the spread of the disease and its effects on UK communities. We need to maintain this capacity for smart, focused and timely innovation so we can quickly respond to whatever nature throws at us.

Most of all, we need politicians who will lead by example, giving clear messages about vaccines and other public health measures. We need a global understanding that if I have an infectious disease, that puts you and your family or country at risk. The virus does not care where you were born, what you believe in, or your political views.

In brief, we have the tools, the skills and the people to respond effectively to another pandemic. The outcomes of COVID and mpox were poor. Unless we improve delivery and leadership, we will fail to control the next pandemic too.

If we look at ourselves as a virus sees us, nothing more than tools for making more viruses, perhaps we can learn a bit of humility and get ready, together, for the next one.","There were cases during the peak of the COVID pandemic, where people who wore masks in public were harassed.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Most of the 80,000 federal workers responsible for researching diseases, inspecting food and administering Medicare and Medicaid under the auspices of the Health and Human Services Department were emailed an offer to leave their job for as much as a $25,000 payment as part of President Donald Trump’s government cuts.

Workers cannot start opting in until Monday and have until 5 p.m. on Friday to submit a response for the so-called voluntary separation offer. The email was sent to staff across the department, which includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, and the National Institutes of Health as well as the Food and Drug Administration, both in Maryland.

The mass email went out to a “broad population of HHS employees,” landing in their inboxes days before agency heads are due to offer plans for shrinking their workforces. HHS is one of the government’s costliest federal agencies, with an annual budget of about $1.7 trillion that is mostly spent on health care coverage for millions of people enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid.

The agency oversees health insurance for roughly half the country through Medicare for older adults and Medicaid for disabled and poor Americans.

There was no immediate comment Sunday from HHS.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump’s health secretary, has hinted at plans at deep cuts to the staff. Last year, he promised to immediately clear out 600 employees at the NIH, the nation’s biomedical research arm. He has not gone that far, but in an interview last month shortly after being sworn in last month, Kennedy said he wanted to remove some workers from the public health agencies.

“I have a list in my head,” Kennedy said of potential firings at the agency. He said some workers “made really bad decisions” on nutrition guidelines.

The Trump administration, with the help of billionaire Elon Musk, has been trying to push out federal workers in an effort to cut costs. In January, most federal employees received a deferred resignation offer that came with eight months of pay. Thousands of probationary employees, too, have been fired across federal agencies, including at HHS.

The latest move to reduce the number of federal health workers comes as the the CDC is assisting with a deadly measles outbreak in West Texas and New Mexico and as lawmakers are debating deep cuts to Medicaid in the federal budget.

HHS workers are directed in the email to reach out to their local human resources office to submit for the voluntary separation.","Workers cannot start opting in until Monday and have until 5 p.m. on Friday to submit a response for the so-called voluntary separation offer.

What’s different now is that with global travel, outbreaks can move quickly among and between populations.

A familiar example would be the COVID-19 pandemic and how it disrupted the world as we know it today. During this period, a lot of technological advancements were achieved during a short time such as vaccine roll-out and also tracking of variants globally.

Since this pandemic, we have been constantly reminded of the threat that emerging infectious diseases pose, as well as new strains of existing microbes, and even infections that may eventually become untreatable. This should also serve as a constant reminder of the need to continue developing the tools and technology to fight them.

Infectious disease outbreaks since COVID-19

In 2022, shortly after the worst of the devastating COVID-19 pandemic had passed, the world was rocked by another infectious disease outbreak, which was soon classified as a public health emergency of international concern.

The culprit was mpox, then known as the monkeypox virus.

Unlike SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, this was not a novel virus but had been identified in laboratory monkeys in Denmark as far back as 1958. The first human cases were documented in 1970 among children in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

Since then, there have been multiple reported outbreaks of mpox, the majority of them limited to Africa. This includes a 2022 global outbreak that caused about 250 deaths, representing a fatality rate of 0.2 per cent.

An ongoing outbreak started in 2023 in Central Africa, claiming about 900 lives with a fatality rate of five per cent.

According to the World Health Organization, the two most recent mpox outbreaks were primarily driven by sexual transmission or body contact. There is currently no treatment approved by the FDA for mpox.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darryl Dyck

In early 2024, an avian influenza outbreak resurfaced in the United States when the viral infection that typically affects birds was detected in dairy cows for the first time. It has since spread to about 973 cattle in 17 states, and there have been about 70 human cases among people associated with farm animals.

Recently, a respiratory outbreak known as hMPV has been overwhelming hospitals in Northern China, with children, adolescents and senior citizens being at most risk. The origin of this outbreak is not yet known.

Untreatable sexually transmitted infection

Gonorrhoea is a widely known sexually transmitted infection (STI). Approximately 80 million people were infected by this bacterium in 2020. Though most cases remain treatable, an untreatable form of gonorrhoea is becoming more prevalent, threatening victims with infertility or even cancer.

Treatment failure can happen when a disease adapts to become resistant to antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance has significant implications for global health, including massive financial implications for health care.

An emerging STI threat

Other, uncommon but difficult to treat STIs are emerging. One is called Mycoplasma genitalium, the causative agent for non-gonococcal urethritis — a typically painful infection of the tube that carries urine from the bladder.

With symptoms similar to gonorrhoea, it can lead to infertility, increased susceptibility to HIV, failed pregnancy, cancer of the cervix and more. Yet, it is often misdiagnosed due to it being understudied and its complexity.

This understudied bacterium is naturally resistant to many antibiotics due to its unique structure, making it notoriously difficult to treat.

The WHO works to control the spread of gonorrhoea infections that are resistant to antibiotics through surveillance. My own research is adopting a similar strategy for M. genitalium, by using genomic surveillance to improve our knowledge of the infection and the improved ability to detect antibiotic resistance.

What is genomic surveillance?

Genomic surveillance uses next-generation sequencing technology to identify specific strains of pathogens circulating during an outbreak. This can also determine what genetic characteristics makes some strains more aggressive than others.

This technique was used effectively during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic and helped identify variants quickly.

Genomic surveillance can help us understand what we are facing, allowing us to tackle emerging threats more quickly and efficiently. It can help us develop sensitive, rapid diagnostic tools to detect drug resistance, especially for bacteria that are difficult to study in the lab, such as Mycoplasma genitalium, which is an extremely slow-growing and challenging bacteria.

With the continuing emergence of untreatable infections and new disease outbreaks, genomic sequencing can help meet emerging threats even in regions that lack adequate infrastructure where these tend to occur frequently.

This can be achieved through implementing affordable, user friendly diagnostic tools or developing effective vaccines for endemic regions. An example is the COVID-19 self-test kit that can be used at home. This is one of the key areas my research is also trying to accomplish: improving diagnostics in health care and making them accessible.

Pathogens are constantly evolving to become resistant to treatment in the perpetual battle between humans and infectious diseases.

To get the upper hand, we need to continue developing technology, including rapid and sensitive tools for identifying resistant bacteria and innovative methods for halting the spread of untreatable infections before they become serious pandemics.","Throughout human history, disease outbreaks have emerged and re-emerged.

It is the first death in a measles outbreak that has infected more than 200 people since late January.

Lubbock health officials and the Department of State Health Services said the patient was an unvaccinated school-aged child.

Covenant Children's Hospital in Lubbock, Texas, has seen ""about 20 patients"" admitted with confirmed measles cases, and several have needed intensive care, Dr. Lara Johnson, the hospital's chief medical officer, said Wednesday at a news conference. None of the hospitalized patients had been vaccinated, Johnson said.

As of Tuesday, March 11, the Texas health department has confirmed 223 measles cases and 29 hospitalizations in the outbreak, which is primarily affecting children and teenagers. Johnson said there have been some confirmed cases in adults, but none requiring hospitalization as of Wednesday.

The North Texas area reported its first confirmed case of measles on Feb. 25. Nearly all of those who have been reported ill in Texas were unvaccinated. At least 30 cases have been reported in neighboring New Mexico.

As many as 1 in 20 children who get measles will develop pneumonia, CDC data shows. In some cases, measles can cause severe infections in the lungs and brain that can lead to cognitive issues, deafness or death.

While most people's symptoms improve, about 1 in 5 unvaccinated people will be hospitalized, 1 out of every 1,000 will develop brain swelling that can lead to brain damage, and up to 3 of every 1,000 will die.

""Measles is a deadly virus,"" Johnson said. ""...The predominant issues that we talk about and that have led patients to be admitted to the hospital are those respiratory issues, and so that is a frequent cause of death. There are also neurological issues that can happen acutely, encephalitis, swelling of the brain, blindness, other issues along that line that can also be a part of acute measles.""

There could also be a fatal neurological complication that occurs years after infection, Johnson said.

""There are lots of childhood rashes and fevers, and as parents, we all know that our kids get these here and there. This is not that. This is a much more serious illness that has much greater risk of serious complications,"" Johnson said.

Johnson also contradicted comments from newly sworn-in Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who claimed earlier Wednesday that the majority of the hospitalized cases were for quarantine purposes.

""We don't hospitalize patients for quarantine purposes,"" Johnson said. ""...That quarantine is not something that would happen in a health care facility. We admit patients who need acute, supportive treatment in our hospital.""

Measles is one of the most contagious infectious diseases, but doctors and health officials say the vaccine, which is normally given as part of the combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, is highly safe and effective.

""Measles is an incredibly contagious virus ... and spreads really easily among those who are susceptible or who aren't immune,"" Johnson said. ""So, we know, if you're in a room with someone with active contagious measles, you have about a 90% chance of contracting that illness if you are not immune.""

Johnson noted measles is an airborne virus.

""The best way to contain a measles outbreak is through vaccination,"" Johnson said. ""We're very lucky to have an extremely effective vaccine for measles. Having two doses of a measles vaccine confers 97% lifetime immunity.""

She said the risk to those who have been vaccinated is ""extremely, extremely low...The risk with measles is really for those who are not immune, who have not been vaccinated. And in that population, as I said, it spreads very quickly.""

For children too young to get the measles vaccine, Johnson said parents should continue taking the usual precautions — like avoiding interactions with large crowds — they would this time of year, as it still remains cold, RSV and flu season.

Johnson also said in some cases, infants who are typically considered too young for the vaccine could still receive it, especially if they had a known exposure to the virus, in which case even a 7- or 8-month-old would ideally be immunized within 72 hours of the exposure.

Dr. Céline Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, said recently on ""CBS Mornings"" that even a slight dip in vaccination coverage can lead to outbreaks.

""This is a measles outbreak that began in a very close-knit, rural, Mennonite community that has very low vaccination rates. And unfortunately, we have seen vaccination rates exemptions ... really soar in Texas in recent years,"" she said.

According to recent KFF polling, about 17% of parents say they have skipped or delayed a vaccine dose for their children.

""This is up from about 10% just two years ago. So we're really seeing a lot of exemptions [and] concerns about vaccination that are not warranted,"" Gounder said.

Before a vaccine became available in the 1960s, between 400 and 500 Americans — mostly children — died every year from measles.

""When I graduated from medical school [in 2002], I was confident I would never see a measles outbreak unless I chose to work internationally, because at that time, we were confident we'd eradicated measles from the United States and had really just gotten to a point where we wouldn't see these kinds of outbreaks happening,"" Johnson said. ""Obviously that has changed over the last 20-something years. And so we do see outbreaks pop up more frequently, but that is related to how much we are vaccinating our population. When we think about vaccine-preventable illnesses, they're only preventable if we have adequate vaccination rates.""","It is the first death in a measles outbreak that has infected more than 200 people since late January.

Five years after COVID-19 was declared a global emergency, attempts by the EU to increase medical stockpiles to improve crisis response are stymied by lack of clarity over what individual countries have in reserve.

“Stockpiling of medicines is considered a national security issue in many member states so the information is classified because it can reveal some weaknesses,” Laurent Muschel, Director General at Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (DG HERA) told Euronews.

If a country lacks protection against a specific health threat - whether a pathogen or a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) risk - it could expose vulnerabilities that adversaries might exploit.

""The EU is building a stock of strategic countermeasures for which we need to consider both the European and national stock,” he added.

To be better prepared, the Commission will put forward a strategy on medical countermeasures against public health threats. This will include tools such as joint procurement and a broader EU stockpiling plan.

This strategy will complement the Critical Medicines Act, set to be presented later this month, which focuses on preventing medicine shortages and securing supply chains.

“One way to approach it for me is to look at the different threats and threat by threat look at what is necessary at European level and what is necessary at member state level,” Muschel said.

He said that DG HERA is currently working with each member state to assess threats and set targets, deciding how much should be covered at the EU level and how much should be the responsibility of individual countries.

Better prepared for future pandemics

Despite these challenges in preparedness, Muschel - whose own agency was created after the COVID-19 pandemic - is confident the EU is “much better prepared than five years ago” to confront a health crisis, and that regular testing of emergency protocols ensures that the lessons of COVID-19 are remembered.

According to Muschel, the greatest current risk to the EU is avian flu.

“With regular cases of human infections in the US and the risk of mutation leading to human-to-human transmission, we consider it the biggest threat,” he said, stressing the need for readily available vaccines.

""So far, the cases have been only from animals to humans, but the more people are getting infected, the more there is a risk of mutation,” he said.

As the majority of avian flu cases are in the US, another challenge emerges as the Trump administration’s decision to withdraw from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and limit international communication.

""That's the role of the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention to inform the rest of the world on how the epidemiological situation evolves,” Muschel said.

“I remember that President Trump was criticising China for not being transparent during COVID-19 so I do hope that the United States will not do a similar mistake and that the flow of information will continue”.","If a country lacks protection against a specific health threat - whether a pathogen or a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) risk - it could expose vulnerabilities that adversaries might exploit.

Holy water from an Ethiopian well famed for its 'healing properties' almost started a cholera outbreak in Europe. At least seven people were struck down by the diarrhoea-inducing disease after religious tourists brought the water back to the UK and Germany.

The contaminated water was taken from the Bermel Giorgis well in Ethiopia's Quara district.

The US Defense Department’s intelligence agency believed the virus could have been engineered in a lab in Wuhan, China - and caused the pandemic that has killed seven million people so far.

Scientists at the Defense Intelligence Agency concluded the Wuhan Institute of Virology was highly skilled at genetic manipulation, according to analysis obtained by US Right to Know.

And they said the unique make-up of Covid was ""consistent with the hypothesis"" that it was ""a lab-engineered virus"" that ""escaped"".

The 46-page presentation - dated June 25, 2020 and marked ""secret"" - concluded that the virus could have come from ""a large bank"" of bat coronaviruses at the US-funded Wuhan lab.

For years, Shi Zhengli - the lead scientist at the Wuhan lab dubbed ""Batwoman"" - manipulated viruses to make them more infectious in humans, experts claim.

Her lab has been at the centre of the storm since Covid emerged just miles from the facility.

Just weeks before Covid emerged, their ""bank"" of more than 20,000 viruses was mysteriously taken offline.

Many believe it could hold key clues about the origins.

So far, the CIA, FBI and the US Department of Energy have all backed a lab leak as the most likely explanation - with many pointing the finger at the Wuhan lab.

The Sun also revealed how military chiefs were repeatedly told that Covid was a lab leak at the start of the pandemic.

But the new document from the Defense Intelligence Agency is the most detailed analysis released to the public so far that explains the evidence behind the theory.

James Phillips, former Special Adviser to the Prime Minister between April 2020 and September 2022, said: ""This is precisely the conclusion our team came to at the time, but in direct contradiction to the position the UK science establishment strongly took.""

Biosafety expert Dr Richard Ebright claimed: ""All informed parties and persons - without exception - have known for five years.

""This includes those who lied to the public for five years.""

Scientist Steve Massey told US Right to Know that the documents are ""highly significant"".

He said it shows that ""a strong scientific basis supporting a potential lab leak was identified early on"".

The analysis also pointed out that researchers at the Wuhan lab were carrying out experiments at biosafety levels ""which would make an accidental release"" of an infectious bat coronavirus ""more likely"".

They also noted ""Chinese labs have had a history of virus escapes"".

The docs were disclosed through a FOI request for assessments from scientists Robert Greg Cutlip, Jean-Paul Chretien, and John Hardham.

The trio had conducted work for the National Center for Medical Intelligence - which is part of the Defense Intelligence Agency.

The Great Covid Cover-up By Imogen Braddick, Assistant Foreign Editor FEW of us had heard of the Chinese city of Wuhan when the world was first paralysed by Covid-19 five years ago. Today, the sprawling metropolis is synonymous with the ­pandemic that claimed 227,000 lives in the UK — along with its sinister labs where top secret biological experiments are ­carried out. Within the first few days of Britain’s initial lockdown in March 2020, as millions were confined to their homes, questions were already being asked about whether Wuhan’s ­Institute of Virology could be behind the outbreak. Now, as the country marks the five-year anniversary of Covid-19, an exclusive documentary by The Sun reveals the experts, scientists and investigators who not only believe the virus was caused by a lab leak, but that American scientists helped to cover up the scandal. Our documentary took me to the heart of the origins of Covid and explores whether China was trying to cover up the creation of a ­biological weapon by blaming the pandemic on a wet food market 17 miles away. We also reveal that, while scientists publicly insisted the disease came from “natural” sources, behind the scenes they were exchanging messages about a laboratory leak. One expert told us: “Watergate was nothing compared to this. “This is the Chernobyl of biology.” Dr Robert Redfield, the former head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said that a few months before the pandemic, the Wuhan Institute was taken over by the Chinese military while officials deleted its databases and took on a contract for a new ventilation system. We now know that three lab researchers fell ill in November 2019 — a month before the first Covid cases were reported to the World Health Organisation. “I think that’s when the pandemic started,” said Dr Redfield, describing a “frenzied cover-up that was keeping Chinese President Xi Jinping up at night”. The US virologist says he was “aggressively silenced” when he voiced fears Covid had leaked from the lab, where “Batwoman” scientist Shi Zhengli was carrying out experiments on strains of coronavirus.

In August 2023, The Australian reported that scientists from four intel agencies agreed with Chretien and Cutlip’s views.

Yet government officials kept the findings out of the public eye.

It comes after The Sun's documentary The Covid Files: Inside the Wuhan lab-leak scandal lifted the lid on the early days of the pandemic in 2020 that killed millions.

We spoke the experts, scientists and investigators who not only believe the virus was caused by a lab leak - but that American scientists helped to cover up the scandal.

Scientists have repeatedly said that Covid was ""exquisitely matched"", ""completely pre-adapted"" and ""supercharged"" for humans.

And in January, we revealed that Dr Zhengli is still doing ""risky"" virus experiments.

Robert Redfield, the director of America's CDC during the pandemic, said the experiments have ""potentially catastrophic consequences"".

In a paper published in Nature, Shi and a team of scientists boasted they had built the first ""customised"" coronavirus ""receptors"".

In other words, Shi is creating the building blocks to change viruses so that they can infect different species - including humans, Mr Redfield said.

He said: ""Take bird flu - you can modify the receptor so that instead of chickens and turkeys, it can infect humans.

""It's potentially dangerous research. You are taking a non-pathogenic virus and changing it so that it could end up being dangerous to humans.

""You may have a pathogen that is restricted to pigs - but now you could totally change it so that it's highly infectious to other species too.

""She's playing around with bat viruses and modifying their receptor - so now they'll infect cows or chickens, for example. It's ill-advised.

""There's potential catastrophic consequences. It could cause a new pandemic in animals or humans.""

The research will make growing viruses in human cells easier as they have created ""customised"" receptors for viruses.

It means viruses can be more easily adapted to humans, experts said.

Dr Alina Chan, a genetic engineering expert, told The Sun: ""It looks like they have a new suite of engineered host cells to isolate more novel coronaviruses.

""There’s some potential here for risky work to happen downstream.""

Dr Chan, who co-authored Viral on the origins of the pandemic, added: ""In other words, once you have all these novel viruses growing in the lab, what do you do with them?""

Many pieces of the puzzle on the pandemic are yet to be found - and after five years of searching, no natural origin has been discovered.

Photo courtesy of Alfred Health

March 12 (UPI) -- Health experts say an Australian study linking sexual activity to an infection that 1 in 3 U.S. women contract has provided a new tool to prevent recurrences, as well as find a cure.

In the wake of what's being hailed as a landmark study, experts from around the world told UPI this week that they've gained a key new insight into the nature of bacterial vaginosis, although they also cautioned that finding a cure for all women will require more work.

BV is caused by a disruption in the bacteria present in the vagina. In BV, the ""good"" or ""healthy"" bacteria called lactobacilli are replaced with a group of ""bad"" or ""non-optimal' bacteria, causing symptoms such as discharge and odor.

While most women with BV do not experience complications, it can increase the risk of developing pelvic inflammatory disease, getting a sexually transmitted infection and experiencing pregnancy complications, such as preterm birth.

BV has been treated since the 1980s with oral or vaginal antibiotics. However, half of women experience recurrences within three to six months of completing antibiotics. Women in monogamous relationships with a regular sexual partner are even more likely to get BV again after antibiotics.

Until now, BV was not widely considered to be sexually transmitted, despite evidence that showed a possible connection. But the study published last week found a strong linkage that promises to ""forever change the way BV is treated,"" according to its authors, clinician scientist Catriona Bradshaw and senior research fellow Lenka Vodstrcil, of the Melbourne Sexual Health Center and Monash University.

The study was published Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine. In it, they determined that BV is indeed sexually transmitted and reported that when male partners took oral and topical antimicrobial therapies, those actions -- combined with the usual antibiotic treatment for women -- resulted in significantly lower recurrence rates.

They found a 35% rate of BV recurrence among couples in which both partners were treated, compared with a 63% rate of recurrence among those in a standard-care control group after 12 weeks.

They undertook the effort after earlier studies showed that men may carry bacteria associated with BV in their urethras, and that microbes found in the penis can predict a woman's risk of contracting the condition.

Past trials testing that connection didn't show an increased incidence of cure, which was interpreted as evidence against sexual transmission. However, most of those trials had ""substantive limitations,"" Bradshaw and Vodstrci argued, including limited statistical power among other drawbacks.

Their findings, based on 150 couples in monogamous relationships from April 2019 through November 2023, have been hailed as a breakthrough in efforts to find a cure for BV, which have been hampered by an incomplete understanding of its origins and development.

Bradshaw told UPI in emailed comments the study proved for the first time that ""sexual transmission [of BV] is occurring and that reinfection is the dominant driver of recurrence.""

""The fact that concurrent treatment of male partners -- using an oral antibiotic to target urethral BV bacteria and a topical antibiotic cream to target the penile skin BV bacteria -- very significantly reduces BV recurrence for women confirms reinfection of women is occurring.

""This is exactly what we see with STIs like chlamydia. If you don't treat the male partner, women get chlamydia back again,"" she said.

She noted that the women in the trial were ""highly motivated with highly recurrent BV."" Some had strong risk factors for recurrence, such as uncircumcised male partners and an IUD birth control device.

""Recurrence rates in these women are typically 60% to 80%, and this intervention more than halved recurrence rates,"" Bradshaw said.

She added: ""So, does this change the way BV is forever treated? Yes, it does. It is a simple strategy that is highly relevant to women with an ongoing male partner. Will it cure all women? No, but it offers a very significant proportion of these women the prospect of a cure, which they have never had before.""

The trial, Bradshaw added, also is ""a major paradigm shift in knowledge and clinical practice that very importantly helps us get far closer to curing all women, as it identifies a group of women who may be experiencing BV persistence due to female factors, such as an IUD.""

Reaction from women's health experts and researchers contacted by UPI was uniformly positive, although many cited the need for continuing study.

Rebecca Brotman, an epidemiology and public health professor and researcher at the University of Maryland's Center for Advanced Microbiome Research & Innovation, said the Australian trial showed that ""If you have BV and are in a heterosexual, monogamous relationship ... you are more likely to achieve a cure and prevent recurrence if both you and your partner receive simultaneous treatment.""

While it marks ""a significant advancement in BV treatment, further research is necessary to confirm the findings across diverse populations and for a longer duration of follow-up,"" Brotman added.

""The trial proved a significant reduction in BV recurrences with male partner treatment, but 35% still recurred in the partner-treatment group. I hope this trial paves the way for future studies to further explore the underlying causes, prevention strategies and improved treatment options for BV,"" she said.

Brotman also warned that classifying BV as a sexually transmitted infection needs to be approached carefully, ""as it could unintentionally reinforce stigma associated with sexual activity and BV. Further research is needed to clarify these relationships and their implications for prevention.""

Dr. Kameelah Phillips, an obstetrician-gynecologist and founder of Calla Women's Health in New York City, said the study ""reinforces what many of us -- both doctors and patients -- have long suspected: Sexual intercourse in heterosexual couples is a significant risk factor for recurrent BV, and treating both partners in monogamous relationships may be an important consideration.""

While it represents ""an exciting step forward in women's health,"" Phillips said it's important to acknowledge ""the study's limitations. With a sample size of only 150 couples, these findings will need validation in larger and more diverse populations before they can influence clinical guidelines.

""Still, for the millions of women who struggle with recurrent BV, this research highlights the need for fresh, innovative approaches to treatment,"" she said. ""They deserve more than temporary fixes -- they deserve solutions that truly address the root of the problem.""

Dr. Caroline Mitchell, director of the Vulvovaginal Disorders Program at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, told UPI the latest findings ""offer us another, important tool for helping prevent recurrence of BV in some patients. Since treatment options in the field haven't substantively changed since 1982, this is a huge win for women.""

In her practice, Mitchell said, she see patients for whom BV ""seems very sexually facilitated,"" but for others it is not the case at all, ""so I don't think this is universal. BV isn't like chlamydia. There isn't always that direct connection -- especially for recurrent BV.

""However, BV does seem to be sexually facilitated -- and the results of this study suggest that microbes on the penis likely play a role in at least some cases,"" she added.

""For people with highly recurrent BV, I do think that there may be some passing back and forth of BV-associated bacteria between sexual partners, and that treating both people ... will be necessary to clear those organisms.""","Women in monogamous relationships with a regular sexual partner are even more likely to get BV again after antibiotics.
If you don't treat the male partner, women get chlamydia back again,"" she said.
Some had strong risk factors for recurrence, such as uncircumcised male partners and an IUD birth control device.
While it marks ""a significant advancement in BV treatment, further research is necessary to confirm the findings across diverse populations and for a longer duration of follow-up,"" Brotman added.

Hantavirus, found throughout the world, is spread by contact with rodents or their urine or feces. It does not spread between people. There is no specific treatment or cure, but early medical attention can increase the chance of survival.

An infection can rapidly progress and become life-threatening.

“It really starts like the flu: body aches, feeling poorly overall,” said Dr. Sonja Bartolome of UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. “Early in the illness, you really may not be able to tell the difference between hantavirus and having the flu.”

The virus can cause a severe and sometimes deadly lung infection called hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The agency began tracking the virus after a 1993 outbreak in the Four Corners region — the area where Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah meet.

It was an astute physician with the Indian Health Service who first noticed a pattern of deaths among young patients, said Dr. Michelle Harkins, a pulmonologist with the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center who for years has been studying the disease and helping patients.

“They were healthy, they had no medical problems and they were coming in with a cardiopulmonary arrest,” she said, prompting the CDC’s involvement as experts worked to determine what the patients had in common.

The majority of U.S. cases since then have been in western states, especially the southwest. Between 1993 and 2022, there were 864 reported U.S. cases. New Mexico had the highest number over that time, at 122, followed by Colorado at 119.

There were seven cases confirmed in 2023 and another seven in 2024, according to the New Mexico Department of Health. As for deaths, the state has reported 52 between 1975 and 2023.

The CDC has offered to test samples involved in Arakawa’s case to learn more about the strain of virus that infected her and to perform pathology testing.

Symptoms start one to eight weeks after exposure and initially can include fatigue, fever and muscle aches, according to the CDC. As the disease progresses, symptoms can include coughing, shortness of breath and tightness in the chest as the lungs fill with fluid. About a third of people who develop respiratory symptoms from the disease can die, the CDC says.

Despite years of research, Harkins said many questions have yet to be answered, including why it can be mild for some people and very severe for others and how antibodies are developed. She and other researchers have been following patients over long periods of time in hopes of finding a treatment.

“A lot of mysteries,” she said, noting that what researchers do know is that mouse exposure is a key.

The best way to avoid the germ is to minimize contact with rodents and their droppings. Use protective gloves and a bleach solution for cleaning up rodent droppings. Public health experts caution against sweeping or vacuuming which can cause virus to get into the air.

The hemorrhagic disease, known for its horrific symptoms like bleeding from the eyes, has already been flagged by health chiefs as a ""priority pathogen"" with pandemic potential.

The victim - a boy, according to The New York Times - had been taken to three different hospitals while unwell.

His three siblings were reportedly ill but have recovered, to child’s father said in documents seen by the paper.

The boy’s mother and her newborn infant died of unknown causes in January, it added.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) confirmed the death on Saturday and has since ramped up efforts in surveillance and contact tracing.

Uganda had hoped the outbreak was under control after eight Ebola patients were discharged in February, but this new death raises concerns.

In total, there are now 10 confirmed cases of the disease in the east African country, including two deaths.

The first known fatality, a 32-year-old nurse, was reported in late January.

He experienced fever-like symptoms, sought care at multiple facilities and consulted a traditional healer before dying.

The Ebola strain responsible for the nurse's death and the outbreak is the Sudan strain, while the strain affecting the child has not yet been confirmed.

It is the most contagious but least deadly variant – although it still kills around 50 per cent of those it infects.

With no approved vaccines for the Sudan strain of Ebola, contact tracing is crucial to prevent more infections.

However, since the most recent outbreak, experts have launched a trial of a jab against the variant.

In early February, the first participant received a dose of the vaccine developed by the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, a global non-profit. Since then, thousands more have been vaccinated.

Local health officials were hopeful after successfully treating contacts of the nurse, but the source of the outbreak is still under investigation.

WHO is helping by screening over 20,000 travellers daily at Uganda’s border points.

4 Ebola has already been flagged by health chiefs as a ""priority pathogen"" with pandemic potential.

Ebola spreads through contact with bodily fluids or contaminated materials.

It is a severe, often fatal illness that can cause symptoms like fever, vomiting blood and diarrhoea, and uncontrolled bleeding from various body parts in the later stages.

Uganda has faced multiple outbreaks of Ebola, including one in 2022 that killed 55 people and a previous one in 2000, that killed hundreds.

This latest outbreak is part of a broader trend of viral hemorrhagic fevers in East Africa, with Tanzania and Rwanda also reporting Marburg outbreaks recently.

What is Ebola? Ebola is a virus transmitted through direct contact with blood and body fluids and objects that have been contaminated by someone with Ebola. It also spreads through contact with sick or dead wild animals. It can take symptoms two to 21 days to appear following infection - this is known as an incubation period. Ebola first manifests as a high fever, intense muscle and joint pain, headaches and a sore throat. Initial symptoms are often followed by vomiting and diarrhoea, rashes on the skin, kidney and liver failure, and sometimes internal and external bleeding. People who survive the virus can suffer from arthritis as well as vision and hearing problems. Some types of Ebola can be prevented with vaccines and treated with medicines.

Ebola was discovered in 1976 in simultaneous outbreaks in South Sudan and Congo, where it occurred in a village near the Ebola River, after which the disease is named.

The disease is among several other on the WHO's watch list along with dengue and the bubonic plague of pathogens that could trigger the next pandemic.

The list was put together by 200 scientists from more than 50 countries after reviewing a shortlist of 1,600 bacterium and viruses.

Those marked as having 'pandemic potential' were easy to catch and potentially deadly in humans.

Scientists say urban sprawl and deforestation are driving up risky wildlife encounters, while global travel is giving diseases a free pass to spread across the globe.

There is also concern that climate change could be making parts of the world more suitable for disease-spreading critters to thrive.","A FOUR-YEAR-OLD child has died of Ebola in Uganda, marking the second fatality in the ongoing outbreak declared on January 30.

Federal health officials notified members of the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee of the cancellation in an email Wednesday afternoon, said committee member Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.

The email, Offit said, offered no explanation for the scrapped meeting.

A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the FDA, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The cancellation comes as the United States is in the midst of a particularly severe flu season. So far, 86 children and 19,000 adults have died this season, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

“I’m quite shocked,” Norman Baylor, a former director of the FDA’s Office of Vaccine Research and Review, said in an email. “As you know, the VRBPAC is critical for making the decision on strain selection for the next influenza vaccine season.”

The FDA typically convenes the meeting every spring to get recommendations on which strains should be included in the upcoming flu vaccine.

The meetings are important because the flu virus changes year to year, and the vaccine must be updated to provide the best protection. Deciding on the strains in the spring gives vaccine manufacturers enough time to produce the shots to be ready for the fall.

For the 2024-25 flu season, drugmakers supplied the United States with an estimated 148 million doses of flu shots, according to the CDC. It’s unclear what the canceled meeting will mean for people in the United States who want to get a flu vaccine next season.

On Friday, a World Health Organization advisory committee is scheduled to meet on which strains should be included in the next flu vaccines in the Northern Hemisphere. That meeting typically influences the FDA’s strain selection.

In January, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to begin the process of withdrawing the United States from the WHO. Federal health officials were later ordered to stop communicating with the WHO.

Stat News reported Monday that officials from both the FDA and the CDC would participate virtually in the WHO meeting, however.

The canceled FDA advisory meeting comes just days after a CDC vaccine advisory committee meeting was abruptly postponed.

That meeting included a presentation and vote on a number of vaccines, including the use of the British drugmaker GSK’s meningococcal vaccine, as well as for a new chikungunya vaccine and the recently approved at-home nasal spray for influenza.

The canceled meeting in March is likely to add to concerns among scientists that HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr, an anti-vaccine activist, could undermine the vaccine regulatory process in the United States, possibly leading to a resurgence of preventable diseases.

Lawrence Gostin, director of the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University, said it is a “clearly emerging pattern to undermine, even eliminate, scientific advisory committees at HHS.”

“I fear that Secretary Kennedy is implementing his long-held skepticism of science and scientific evidence,” Gostin said.

Earlier Wednesday, Texas health officials reported that an unvaccinated child in the state died from the measles, the first death from the virus in a decade. An outbreak in the state has led to at least 124 cases, mostly in children.

“It’s a bad day for infectious diseases,” said Dr. Ofer Levy, director of the precision vaccines program at Boston Children’s Hospital, who has advised the FDA on vaccines.","A Food and Drug Administration vaccine advisory committee meeting scheduled for March to select the strains to be included in next season’s flu shot has been canceled, a panel member said Wednesday.

Follow her on Mastodon and Bluesky . You can reach Helen on Signal at hbranswell.01.

A group of researchers last week released a small, preliminary paper theorizing that Covid-19 vaccines may be linked in rare cases to a constellation of lingering symptoms not dissimilar to those associated with long Covid.

They intended for their work to be the subject of academic discussion and to spur further study of what they dubbed “post-vaccination syndrome.” Instead, it has exploded online — and become a parable for the ways in which the internet is being used to weaponize basic vaccine research vital to advancing scientific knowledge about the safe use of these key products.

The study was released last Tuesday on medRxiv, a so-called preprint server where unpublished studies can be shared before they go through peer review, the process by which other scientists kick the tires, effectively, to help journals decide whether or not submitted research deserves to be published. The senior authors of the paper, immunologist Akiko Iwasaki and cardiologist Harlan Krumholz, both serious scientists, were clear in the press release they issued and interviews with STAT that these are preliminary findings that need much more study.

They both also insisted that they felt a responsibility to their patients to share what they are seeing, in the hopes it would prompt other researchers to investigate, figure out how to make safer Covid vaccines if there truly is a link, and, hopefully, find ways to help people affected by any such condition.

“I just saw people suffering and thought we should follow the science,” said Krumholz, founder of the Yale School of Medicine’s Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation. He stressed he continues to get Covid booster shots, and doesn’t think people should “overindex” what he, Iwasaki, and their co-authors are reporting.

“I don’t think it’s ready to be used in clinical decision-making. So, if anything, I’m just trying to tell people: This shouldn’t be factoring into your decision right now.”

That is not the message the internet is hearing — or at least the parts of it where people routinely challenge the safety of vaccines. There, news of this paper “is spreading like wildfire,” one critic of the work, Adam Gaffney, an assistant professor of pulmonary and critical care medicine at Harvard Medical School, noted in a critique on the social media platform X.

Elsewhere on X — and beyond — it was held up as proof that millions of people who believe they are suffering lingering illness from Covid infection were actually injured by the vaccine instead. (Many people with long Covid developed the condition before vaccines for the virus were developed.)

Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, and the owner of X, reposted one such claim to his 218.7 million followers. Right-wing influencer Benny Johnson seized on the study as well.

“We tried to warn you. This is completely horrifying,” Johnson said, also on X. “Studies are beginning to prove that the COVID Jab is far worse than COVID — and may in fact be a deadly poison for your immune system. Thousands of people need to go to jail.”

One researcher, whose university — like a number right now — has told its academics to stay out of media coverage of political events, expressed exasperation at the scientists behind the study, asking: “Why on earth would you do this now if this is preliminary?” Post-vaccination syndrome “is a term that RFK will love,” this individual said.

The fact that the broadness of the term could be read to encompass vaccines other than Covid shots, even though the paper only investigated the role Covid shots might be playing in the illness it describes, was also seen by some as a concern.

“The term is a problem, it’s a real problem, especially at this political moment,” said Gaffney, who believes the study has multiple shortcomings. “We’re at a moment right now where the U.S. government is undercutting people’s trust in science and vaccinations probably like never before in history. And to coin this novel syndrome without even proving that it’s caused by the vaccine is very worrisome to me.”

RFK Jr., obviously, is the new secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. The longtime critic of vaccines has earned substantial income for years speaking and publishing about perceived dangers of vaccines, and bringing vaccine injury lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies.

The paper was posted to medRxiv during Kennedy’s first week at the helm of HHS, when there were already signs that policies promoting vaccines would come under attack. A meeting of a key vaccine advisory group long scheduled for this week was postponed, with a new date TBD. There were reports Kennedy is about to fire some or all of the existing members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, giving him a chance to name new members to the committee. As it currently stands, Kennedy would not have openings to fill on ACIP before 2027.

Into the roiling cauldron of unease about the future of U.S. vaccination policy dropped the Yale paper, comparing a range of biomarkers from 42 previously healthy people who are believed to have developed symptoms after getting a Covid shot to 22 still healthy individuals. Though it’s not yet known whether all the people studied are suffering from the same condition, there seemed to be at least a temporal association between getting vaccinated and developing symptoms like exercise intolerance, excessive fatigue, tinnitus, and brain fog, among others.

Most of the people complaining of the symptoms developed them after their first or second Covid shot, though some experienced onset after a third, and in a few cases, a fourth dose of vaccine. There were cases among people who received most of the vaccines used in the U.S. — Pfizer’s, Moderna’s, and a Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which was briefly available but was withdrawn by the company in 2023.

“Oh, no! Really?” groaned an evidently dismayed Iwasaki, when told Musk had amplified a post on X alleging the study proved long Covid is caused by Covid vaccines. “I don’t want anyone to conflate the two different syndromes in one bucket. That is not the message we’re trying to convey.”

The incident is a textbook example of something that plagues vaccine safety researchers: a damned-if-they-do-and-damned-if-they-don’t phenomenon. If researchers see evidence that use of a vaccine might be causing harm, they are ethically required to report it and pursue study of it. But public discussion of so-called signals of possible vaccine side effects are quickly weaponized by anti-vaccine forces.

It is not uncommon for such signals to turn out to be false alarms, disproven by rigorous study. In the first couple of years after the H1N1 flu pandemic of 2009, there appeared to be higher-than-expected rates of miscarriage among pregnant people vaccinated against the new virus, though only among those who had received the shot in back-to-back years. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention funded a study to explore the issue over three flu seasons. The conclusion was that the earlier findings had been a statistical anomaly; there was no increased risk. The resulting study was published in the journal Vaccine.

Some safety signals, however, do prove to be true. The first rotavirus vaccine, to prevent a diarrheal and vomiting disease that afflicts young children, was withdrawn from the market when it was linked to an increased risk of developing intussusception, a serious bowel blockage. And the CDC and its vaccine advisory panel have taken a go-slow approach with RSV vaccines for older adults, because of an apparent increased risk of developing Guillain-Barré syndrome after vaccination. GBS is a neurological condition involving muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis. Most people fully recover, but some sustain permanent nerve damage.

To conceal possible side effects would be morally wrong and could endanger the health of people who take vaccines to prevent illness. Vaccine safety researchers do what Krumholz and Iwasaki did — they follow the science. But in doing so, and in talking about possible links between receipt of a vaccine and negative side effects before an association is found to be real could be perceived as casting aspersions on individual vaccines and vaccines in general.

Edward Belongia, who was the senior author on both the studies exploring whether vaccination with H1N1-containing shots was elevating the risk of miscarriage in pregnant people, said people who research vaccine safety are well aware of the possibility their work could be used to undermine people’s willingness to get vaccinated or to vaccinate their children.

“Absolutely. We know it gets weaponized and it’s very, very hard to fight that,” said Belongia, who is a senior research scientist doing vaccine research and infectious disease epidemiology at the Marshfield Clinic Research Institute in Wisconsin.

“Science is at a disadvantage against them because they can take little bits of information and distort it, twist it, oversimplify it, and for the general public that doesn’t really know much about science or how this works, it sounds concerning,” he said. “[But] there are all sorts of reasons why what we’re seeing … might not be real.”

Alison Buttenheim, a professor of nursing at the University of Pennsylvania who studies vaccine acceptance and hesitancy, said it’s critically important that vaccine researchers follow the leads that emerge, regardless of whether the outcome exonerates or implicates a vaccine.

She finds it reassuring to know this work is being done. But Buttenheim noted that science literacy among Americans is generally not high, and people don’t understand that science is an iterative process. “We live in a world where people are really uncomfortable with the idea that science evolves,” she said.

The increased tendency to release papers as preprints, before they’ve been vetted, is adding to the public relations challenges for vaccine safety research, said Belongia, though he noted that getting information out quickly, so that other researchers could build off new findings, was of critical importance during the Covid pandemic.

Iwasaki said the group grappled with the question of whether to post the paper to medRxiv, or to wait for it to go through peer review.

advertisement

“I think about this every day,” she said. “But we opted to share this data in preprint because first, the publication process usually takes a while, and patients are suffering every day. And we didn’t want to wait until something is published to share this information with the patients … because most of them have been completely ignored.”

Krumholz concurred. “We did debate it a lot,” he said. “In the end, the information about it was getting out by the grapevine and we thought better to preprint it as it was going through peer review. And we have had experience with journals not wanting to publish information about vaccine adverse effects — and we do not know how long it might take to publish it.”

Belongia said there’s no easy answer to the question of what vaccine researchers who find themselves in such situations should do. The work must continue, and the public has a right to be kept abreast of signals and the ultimate findings — transparency is critical to maintaining the public’s faith in vaccines, he said.

Still, that transparency will be used against the field, Belongia admitted. “I don’t know the solution in terms of how to deal with this and maintain public trust in an environment where any sort of measured voice that reflects the uncertainty of what we’re looking at is drowned out by the chorus of misinformation and disinformation.”","Helen Branswell covers issues broadly related to infectious diseases, including outbreaks, preparedness, research, and vaccine development.

SALT LAKE CITY — As the popularity of keeping backyard and urban chicken flocks grows, health and agriculture experts warn that bird flu can pose a risk to your feathered friends — and by extension, a small risk to you, as well.

Estimates vary on how many people have backyard chickens. But the number, regardless of who does the count, is significant. In 2023, an American Pet Products Association's pet ownership survey suggested about 13% of households have backyard chickens. That's especially popular among millennials and Gen Z.

Baltimore Magazine put the number at close to 12 million people in the U.S. with backyard chickens.

Health and agriculture officials say there are steps you can take to improve the odds your flock stays healthy.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza has been confirmed throughout the U.S. in recent years, including in some backyard flocks. As the name suggests, the H5N1 bird flu circulating is very contagious.

How bird flu spreads

Many wild birds are infected with bird flu. And that's the most common way that other animals become infected. They encounter, play with or eat infected wild birds.

The Centers for Disease Control and Preventions reports that the incidence of backyard flocks infecting their human owners is pretty rare, but it does happen, usually through direct contact. People handle their birds, then touch their own eyes, nose or mouth, which are the entry points for infection. They can also inhale droplets without touching the birds. The health agency notes that infected birds that can be contagious may look healthy.

People can also become infected from touching contaminated surfaces. By flapping their wings, scratching or shaking their heads, the birds can send droplets that can be inhaled or land on something that can be touched.

The CDC emphasizes that ""no human bird infections have been reported from proper handling of poultry meat or from eating properly cooked poultry or poultry products.""

Flocks that are infected may die suddenly. Or the poultry can have low energy, lack of appetite, purple discoloration, less egg production, ill-formed eggs, nasal discharge or coughing, lack of coordination and diarrhea, per the American Veterinary Medical Association.

Protecting yourself if you have chickens

CDC's guide for backyard flock owners offers a number of suggestions to minimize risk:

Don't touch sick or dead birds, their droppings, litter or water sources that might be contaminated with their bodily fluids without donning personal protective equipment.

Always wear protective equipment around sick or dead birds, including safety goggles, an N95 mask, disposable gloves, disposable and fluid-resistant coveralls and rubber boots. It should be put on and taken off in different clear areas, where possible.

Don't touch your eyes, nose or mouth.

Don't touch your protective gear until you are removing it, then wash your hands in soap and water,

Never wear used personal protective equipment in your home.

When cleaning and disinfecting, don't stir up the bird waste, dust or feathers, which can disperse the virus into the air. When you're done, toss the protective equipment or clean it properly.

You should remove the personal protective equipment in this order: First, clean and disinfect the boots, then take them off. Take off and throw away the coveralls, then do the same with the gloves. Wash your hands with soap and water. Next, take off the goggles, head cover and mask. If the goggles are reusable, disinfect them. Dispose of the mask. Wash hands with soap and water again.

To disinfect the items that are reusable, use disinfectant approved by the Environmental Protection Agency that has label claims it is effective against influenza A viruses. Follow the label instructions.

Wash your clothing in hot water and detergent and dry on high heat. Immediately take a shower. And pay attention to your health for 10 days after you were exposed to potentially infected birds or contaminated materials.

Cats and dogs at risk?

Cats and dogs that are outdoors can also be at some risk if they encounter sick or dead birds. And that includes if they are near your backyard flock. The best prevention is to keep them away from wild birds, poultry and cattle.

According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, signs for them can include fever, lethargy, low appetite, red and inflamed eyes, nasal or eye discharge, difficulty breathing and neurologic signs like tremors or poor coordination.

The association also says not to feed pets raw meat or poultry or raw milk.","As the name suggests, the H5N1 bird flu circulating is very contagious.

It's a scourge that has afflicted mankind for more than a thousand years. And it's what keeps Adam Ratner up at night: measles.

""It is the most infectious disease that we know by far — much more infectious than flu, much more infectious than COVID or polio or Ebola or anything else that I can think of,"" says Ratner, a pediatric infectious disease physician in New York City.

In his new book, Booster Shots, Ratner makes the case that the control of measles is a test of how good our public health institutions are. And the fact that it is making a comeback is a bad sign.

""When vaccination levels start to fall, we see measles outbreaks first,"" he says. ""And then those are often followed by outbreaks of other vaccine-preventable diseases, things that are a little less contagious than measles,"" he says, adding that ""it's only February and we have already had, you know, small clusters of measles in Texas and Rhode Island and Georgia and a couple of other states.""

Globally, it's estimated that measles killed more than 107,000 children in 2023, mostly unvaccinated or undervaccinated children under the age of 5. Last year, the U.S. had 284 measles cases — the highest number in five years. That comes as kindergarten vaccination rates against measles, mumps and rubella have dropped below the 95% threshold that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says is needed to prevent community outbreaks.

The U.S. hasn't reported a measles death since 2015. ""But I think that with more cases, with larger outbreaks, that may change,"" Ratner says.

Before the measles vaccine was developed in the early 1960s, the disease used to kill hundreds of children each year in the United States. Ratner sees the resurgence of measles as one of the ironic byproducts of the success of vaccination. With vaccine hesitancy on the rise, he says that remembering the lessons of our past with this disease is more urgent than ever.

""Measles thrives on being underestimated,"" he says. ""We tend to forget now, looking back, how bad measles was.""

Ratner says the development of the measles vaccine was just one step in controlling the disease in the U.S. The other was public policy that made vaccination affordable and mandatory. For example, he points to a large measles outbreak in Texarkana in 1970. The metropolitan area straddles Arkansas — which had a school vaccine mandate in place — and Texas, which didn't.

""About 95% of the cases were in the area where there wasn't a vaccine mandate, where kids weren't getting vaccinated in schools. So the political decision that was made about vaccine mandates affected the health of those children,"" he says.

Ratner says he's deeply concerned about the nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as health and human services secretary. Kennedy has campaigned against vaccines for decades and he's expected to be confirmed this week.

""I am very, very worried about the future of not only vaccines, but public health in general in this country and across the world,"" he says.

Ratner makes the case that public policy is critical to public health. He says the most important takeaway from his book is that our public health successes are fragile.

""We live in a society now where child mortality is rare, where diseases like measles are rare, and where when kids are born, you can expect that they will likely grow up happy and healthy,"" he says. ""That is not guaranteed.""

He says it takes political will as well as science to keep the country healthy.

The study published Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention echoes two smaller ones that detected evidence of infection in previously undiagnosed farmworkers. In those studies, several of the infected workers remembered having symptoms of H5N1 bird flu, while none of the veterinarians in the new paper recalled any such symptoms.

The new study is more evidence that the official U.S. tally of confirmed human bird flu infections — 68 in the last year — is likely a significant undercount, said Dr. Gregory Gray, an infectious disease researcher at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston.

“This means that people are being infected, likely due to their occupational exposures, and not developing signs of illness and therefore not seeking medical care,” Gray said. He said it shows that officials cannot fully understand bird flu transmission by only tracking people who go to medical clinics with symptoms.

Study suggests bird flu cases are undercounted

CDC researchers went to an American Association of Bovine Practitioners veterinary conference in September 2024 in Columbus, Ohio. They recruited 150 vets from 46 states to fill out a questionnaire and agree to have their blood drawn. None said they had suffered red eyes or other symptoms associated with bird flu.

Testing found three of the vets, or 2%, had evidence of antibodies to H5N1 infection. All three worked with dairy cattle, as well as other animals. None said they’d worked with a herd that was known to be infected, although one had worked with a flock of infected poultry.

Gray and some colleagues did a study last year of 14 dairy farmworkers and found two, or 14%, had evidence of past infections. Both had experienced symptoms but were never diagnosed.

Another study published last year by the CDC checked 115 dairy workers. The researchers found that eight of them, or 7%, had evidence in their blood of recent infection. Half recalled feeling ill.

The studies were far too small to use as a basis to provide a solid estimate of how many undiagnosed human infections are out there, Gray said. But even just a very small percentage could translate to hundreds or thousands of Americans who were infected while working with animals, he noted.

That’s not necessarily a reason to be alarmed, said Jacqueline Nolting, an Ohio State University researcher who helped CDC with the latest study.

Available studies suggest people who are infected mount antibody responses and may develop natural immunity, which is “good news,” she said.

However, if the virus changes or mutates to start making people very sick, or to start spreading easily from person to person, that would be “a completely different story,” Nolting said.

Experts urge caution around animals

The H5N1 bird flu has been spreading widely among wild birds, poultry, cows and other animals. Its escalating presence in the environment increases the chances people will be exposed, and potentially catch it, officials have said.

Right now the risk to the general public is low, the CDC says. But officials continue to urge people who have contact with sick or dead birds to take precautions, including wearing respiratory and eye protection and gloves when handling poultry.

“No one’s really questioning that the virus has been moving around the country more than has been reported,” said Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory.

He said he expected to see stepped-up information reminding veterinarians across the country to protect themselves with gloves, masks and other equipment to halt infection.

In a new statement reported on Tuesday by CBS, the FDA said it was “aware of reports of death or illness associated with uncooked food in 13 domestic cats in eight households, 1 exotic cat in one household, and an unknown number of animals at two sanctuaries for large felids”.

The FDA added that cases were found in California, Colorado, Oregon and Washington, CBS reports.

Last Friday the FDA told cat and dog food manufacturers who use uncooked or pasteurized materials from cattle or poultry to consider H5N1 bird flu in their food safety plans.

According to the FDA, the virus can be transmitted to cats and dogs when they eat products from infected poultry or cattle, such as unpasteurized milk, uncooked meat or unpasteurized eggs. In felines it can cause severe illness or death; dogs generally display milder clinical signs and lower mortality.

The outbreak of H5N1 in the US began last March when the virus was detected in dairy cattle in Texas and Kansas.

Twelve barn cats died after drinking infected raw milk at a Texas dairy last year, while in December, 20 exotic cats, including a Bengal tiger, four cougars, a lynx and four bobcats, died at an animal sanctuary in Washington.

According to a study published last year in the academic journal Emerging Microbes and infections, cat H5N1 genomes had unique mutations that could suggest “potential virus adaptation”. It found cats could “serve as mixing vessels for reassortment of avian and mammalian influenza viruses” as well as a “bridge” to infect other species.

Earlier this year, Chicago’s Lincoln Park zoo announced that H5N1 infections killed a Chilean flamingo and a harbor seal.

Since the outbreak more than 20 million hens have died, while 134 million birds across the poultry industry have been affected, according to the US Department of Agriculture.

Speaking to reporters last week, Eric Deeble, the US Department of Agriculture’s deputy under-secretary for marketing and regulatory programs, said that the agency was creating a new stockpile of H5N1 vaccines for poultry.","Bird flu in raw food has killed or sickened more than a dozen house cats across the US, according to the Food and Drug Administration.

Avian influenza has a grip on dairy herds in California, a few people have fallen seriously ill in North America and researchers have found that a single mutation could give the virus a better foothold in a person's upper airways.

At the same time, those who're tracking avian influenza's footsteps say most of us don't need to be preoccupied with the virus as we go about our day, at least for now.

""We're really on alert,"" says Benjamin Anderson, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Florida. ""It's a tricky thing to communicate.""

Fears that H5N1 bird flu could unleash a pandemic go back decades, and previous strains of the virus have proven quite deadly in humans. That has not been the case during this current outbreak. Most infections linked to the strain of bird flu circulating globally in wild birds and U.S. dairy herds — technically known as clade 2.3.4.4b — have been mild.

Sponsor Message

But two recent cases are a reminder this isn't a foregone conclusion.

First, a teenager in Canada was hospitalized, as was a Louisiana resident who was exposed to backyard flocks. In each, genetic analysis suggests mutations may have emerged as the virus replicated inside of them. However, there's no evidence any of this has led to human-to-human spread.

""The difficult thing is it's hard to know how much of a heads up we're going to get that things are changing,"" says Richard Webby, a virologist who studies avian influenza at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.

Here's what some experts are saying now.

Should I be worried about catching bird flu?

Despite its wide reach, the strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza — so named because of its lethality in poultry — driving the current outbreak has not adapted to easily infect humans, meaning it's still ""essentially a bird virus,"" says Webby.

Of the more than 65 human cases in the U.S., almost all of them can be traced back to some kind of close contact with infected poultry, wild birds, or dairy cattle. So, if you're not dealing directly with any of these animals, the chance of catching the virus in its current form remains quite low.

Sponsor Message

Unlike the seasonal influenza viruses, bird flu doesn't attack the cell receptors that predominate in a person's upper airways. Instead, it prefers ""avian-type receptors"" deep in the lungs and in the mucus membranes around the eyes, which seems to explain why many recent human cases have presented as conjunctivitis.

""It's not actually very good at infecting people,"" says Anderson. ""What we typically have seen is a lot of viral exposure in order to be infected.""

A few cases have popped up with unexplained origins in California, Missouri, and British Columbia. However, there's no indication any of the people contracted the virus from another human, or spread it to anyone else.

For now, the concern is more about what could transpire as more animals and humans get infected, says Kristen Coleman, who researches airborne infectious diseases at the University of Maryland. ""It's not an immediate risk, but that's not to say that it won't be a risk in the near future.""

That's because every spillover into mammals, including humans, puts added pressure on the virus to adapt to its new host, raising the prospect that certain mutations pop up, which could, under the right circumstance, let the virus more efficiently replicate and infect people.

Scientists already have an idea of what some of the most concerning changes would look like (at least to some extent), and it doesn't appear they've caught on yet, based on testing done in poultry and cattle.

But it's evident this particular strain of H5N1 is sickening a much broader range of mammals than previous ones, says Seema Lakdawala, an influenza researcher at Emory University.

""We don't know why yet, but it could be chance or a precise genetic feature,"" she says.



What does ""close contact"" with a bird look like exactly?

During the current outbreak, poultry workers have generally caught the virus while they're culling infected flocks.

Sponsor Message

This is considered a high risk activity because it can involve handling the animals and spending long stretches of time in facilities where viral particles in their saliva, mucus and poop can hang in the air and contaminate surfaces. For example, workers in Colorado were infected while depopulating birds in hot barns with industrial fans blowing. They struggled to wear personal protective equipment over their mouths, nose and eyes because of the heat.

Historically, human cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 have often been traced back to live bird markets. In this context, people tend to be handling, defeathering, butchering and preparing the animals for sale.

High concentrations of viral particles can spew into the air and be inhaled, or coat surfaces and hands, eventually ending up on your eyes and nose, perhaps after you rub your face, says Webby. ""If you're just walking past an infected bird, it's extremely unlikely that you're going to get it that way.""

Coleman agrees. In a study carried out before this latest outbreak, she sampled the air at a massive live market in Vietnam and discovered it was filled with aerosolized bird flu virus. They could even grow infectious viruses from their samples. Yet, none of the people they tested there had active infections.



Okay, I'm not butchering or touching any birds, but do I need to stop using my bird feeder? What about touching bird poop?

For the average person, it's unlikely you'd get infected from a stray piece of bird poop or from touching your bird feeder, although there isn't necessarily data on these specific scenarios, says Anderson.

How long H5N1 bird flu survives on objects depends on a variety of factors. For example, it can survive for days or even weeks under certain colder conditions and in water. Contracting the virus from a contaminated surface is a legitimate concern for people who are ""handling equipment associated with animal care on poultry or dairy farms,"" says Lakdawala, adding that people should be cautious at petting zoos and agricultural fairs, too.

Bird poop can harbor high loads of the virus, possibly for long stretches of time, but Webby doubts it would be a concern for more than a few days after being exposed to the elements on your porch or deck.

""If you had things that had bird poop on them, yes, you would want to avoid that or disinfect it,"" says Anderson.

You could do the same for your bird feeder. He says just use common sense hygiene principles like washing your hands and avoid touching your face before hand washing.

People who have backyard flocks should be particularly cognizant of the risk, especially if they live in the path of migratory birds. Do your best to keep your poultry from mixing with wild birds. If you're concerned, you can wear an N95 mask around them.



What's the deal with dairy cattle? Do I need to worry about milk?

Unless you're spending time with dairy cattle or raw milk, there's no reason to be concerned.

The spread of bird flu in dairy cattle took scientists by surprise. The best guess is a spillover from birds into dairy cattle in late 2023 was enough to set in motion the nationwide outbreak in dairy cattle today.

The U.S. Food & Drug Administration has found pasteurizing milk can effectively inactivate the virus. The same is true for pasteurized eggs products, and if eggs are cooked to 165 degrees

There's now ""strong"" evidence that contact with raw milk, laden with high concentrations of virus, is how roughly 40 dairy workers have become infected, says Anderson. Most likely this is happening in the milking parlor when people are sprayed in the face, or viral particles are aerosolized and inhaled.

Research has shown that raw milk can ""stabilize the virus on a variety of surfaces for long periods of time,"" says Lakdawala. Hence the warnings against drinking raw milk.

Sponsor Message

Even relatively small amounts can be deadly for mice, according to lab experiments done by Peter Halfmann and his colleagues at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. ""But we don't know how this exactly would work in humans,"" he says. ""It's still a big black box.""

While the exact risk is unknown, Lakdawala considers consuming raw milk a ""high risk activity,"" especially in states like California where bird flu has been found in some of these products.

Dr. Jürgen Richt, a veterinary microbiologist at Kansas State University, echoes that sentiment.

""Is the mouse a good model for humans? I don't know,"" says Richt. ""But don't become a guinea pig.""



What should I be doing to protect my pets?

The basic principles for keeping yourself safe from bird flu also apply to your pets.

Coleman's advice: Give your cats a little bit more supervision when they're outside. Keep them away from wild birds (dead or alive) and rodents, especially if you live on a farm or have backyard poultry.

Coleman recently reviewed the data, and found this current strain of bird flu looks to be more deadly in felines than it is for H5N1 overall, although it's hard to say because of limited data.

She says cats are largely infected with bird flu by consuming raw contaminated meat and by preying on wild birds, including during the current outbreak.

In Oregon, a house cat died after consuming raw pet food, riddled with the virus, which prompted a nationwide recall. It's possible that contaminated meat was behind an outbreak that wiped out 20 cats at a wildlife sanctuary in Washington state. In Los Angeles, raw milk is implicated in the death of several house cats.

Dogs are also susceptible. Last year, a dog in Canada died from the infection after it was found chewing on a dead goose.

Sponsor Message

While pets can develop respiratory symptoms, the infection can manifest as a neurological illness, seeming to mimic rabies, she says. ""If your cat or your dog starts acting funny, maybe circling or acting rabid, make sure to contact a veterinarian right away.""

There have only been a few documented cases of feline-to-human transmission of avian influenza, after people tending to the animals had direct contact, but not during this current outbreak.

Anderson says ""there's no need to panic"" that your pet is going to be getting H5N1 tomorrow, especially if you keep them from these known sources of infection.

""It's just about being aware,"" he says.

President Trump has been upending the global economy in the name of bringing manufacturing back. President Joe Biden signed into law massive investments aimed at doing something similar. The American manufacturing sector is reviving after decades of decay.

But there's something a bit weird undercutting this movement to reshore factory jobs: American manufacturers say they are struggling to fill the jobs they already have.

According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are nearly half a million open manufacturing jobs right now.

Last year, the Manufacturing Institute, a nonprofit aimed at developing America's manufacturing workforce, and Deloitte, a consultancy firm, surveyed more than 200 manufacturing companies. More than 65% of the firms said recruiting and retaining workers was their No. 1 business challenge.

Sponsor Message

Part of the story has been a tight labor market. There have been similar worker recruitment and retention issues in other sectors, like construction and transportation. But the shortfall of manufacturing workers is about more than just that — and with both major political parties pushing to reshore manufacturing, analysts expect the industry's workforce issues to get even more challenging.

The Biden administration invested over $2 trillion on initiatives aimed at reinvigorating American industry, in legislation like the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the CHIPS and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act. There's now an explosion of spending to construct new factories in America, and analysts expect the demand for manufacturing workers to pop.

The average manufacturing worker is also relatively old, and the industry expects a tidal wave of retirements in the coming decade.

The Manufacturing Institute and Deloitte projected that the industry will need 3.8 million additional workers by 2033 and that as many as ""1.9 million of these jobs could go unfilled if workforce challenges are not addressed.""

These estimates, mind you, were calculated before Trump's recent tariffs, which, at least theoretically, are supposed to compel even more manufacturers to build factories in America. If things go to plan, we may need even more Americans to start working in manufacturing in the coming years.

Today in the Planet Money newsletter: If manufacturing jobs are so great, why aren't more Americans doing the ones we already have? And what can the industry and the government potentially do to address this issue? (If you have been forwarded this or are reading it online, you can subscribe to our weekly newsletter here.)

Industry whiplash

Gordon Hanson is an economist at Harvard Kennedy School who has published influential research on American manufacturing, including on what happened to it in the face of competition with China. (We interviewed Hanson about his ""China Shock"" research in a past newsletter.)

Sponsor Message

Hanson sees what you might call whiplash in an industry seeing a reversal of fortune. ""A period in which there's been a substantial increase in manufacturing — it's a very recent phenomenon,"" Hanson says. "" I think we can fill those jobs, but we're just not gonna fill 'em overnight.""

One big reason manufacturers can't fill these jobs overnight is because they require workers to have particular skills. And it's not just skills needed to work on assembly lines. Only around 2 in 5 manufacturing jobs are directly involved in making stuff. Manufacturers also employ people to do research and development, engineering, design, finance, sales, marketing and so on.

Part of the political appeal of bringing manufacturing back is that, historically, they've provided good jobs and career ladders for people without a college education. However, many manufacturing jobs these days actually require college degrees.

Carolyn Lee, the president and executive director of the Manufacturing Institute, says that roughly half of the open positions in manufacturing require at least a bachelor's degree.

That said, the other half of open manufacturing jobs don't require a bachelor's degree. And manufacturers say they are also struggling to fill those.

Lee says some of the most in-demand positions in manufacturing right now are maintenance technicians, machine operators, material handlers and forklift operators.

Is manufacturing paying high enough?

A classic solution to apparent worker shortages: offer higher pay. That would probably convince workers to invest in acquiring coveted skills and enter the manufacturing workforce.

This is one reason Oren Cass, the chief economist and founder of American Compass, a conservative think tank, says he's skeptical whenever employers complain about worker shortages.

"" I have less than zero sympathy for employers who go around complaining about labor shortages and skills gaps,"" Cass says. He jokes that he has a side hustle running an ""incredibly innovative"" biotech firm. ""It employs leading scientists at $10 an hour to develop extraordinary cures. I have 500,000 job openings as well, and I have not been able to fill one of them.""

Sponsor Message

Cass has a point. We've covered a similar phenomenon in trucking: Trucking companies have complained of a ""worker shortage"" for decades, yet relatively low wages and challenging work conditions are clearly a huge factor behind that industry's workforce woes. Addressing those issues would probably go a long way to dealing with their ""shortage.""

Manufacturers have, however, hiked their pay in recent years. That has helped slash the number of open manufacturing positions from their peak of over 1 million open positions in April 2022. (Like many other industries during the COVID-19 pandemic, manufacturers saw a wave of retirements, deaths and quits).

Loading...

Offering higher paychecks would likely compel more Americans to flock to the remaining open positions.

But the higher pay that Americans demand to work in manufacturing is one of the big reasons that many manufacturers left America in the first place. And so this wage issue raises the question of whether many manufacturers, particularly labor-intensive ones, can be profitable and globally competitive in the United States.

Cass believes that tariffs can help even the playing field with foreign competitors. And he stresses that one of the keys to reshoring manufacturing — while maintaining well-paying manufacturing jobs — is higher productivity.

"" If somebody in the United States is 20 times as productive as somebody in China and you have to pay them 20 times as much, you are equally competitive,"" Cass says.

So if American manufacturers can prove to be much more productive than foreign competitors — meaning American workers can make more in less time — they can pay the higher wages needed to attract and retain American workers while still remaining globally competitive.

That, however, is a big if. American manufacturing has been seeing an alarming slowdown in productivity growth in recent years.

The manufacturing PR and skills problems

Lee agrees that manufacturers will be able to entice more people into the industry by offering higher pay. However, she says, the industry's issues with recruitment and retention go beyond dollars and cents.

Sponsor Message

For one, she suggests, manufacturing has a PR problem. Many Americans have outdated notions of what manufacturing jobs actually entail. She suggests that many imagine they're the dirty, monotonous and dangerous factory jobs depicted in Charles Dickens novels. But, Lee says, they're actually ""clean and bright and full of technology."" She sees changing American perceptions about manufacturing as one crucial part of convincing more young people to work in the sector. More generally, if the industry is seen as vibrant and growing, as opposed to dying, that will probably help with recruitment.

But even if the word gets out and more young Americans want to do these jobs, they'll still need the skills to be able to do them.

""These jobs are in factories that are completely different from the factories of 25 years ago,"" Hanson says. ""They require people to know how to use pretty sophisticated machinery.""

""The hardest skills to find are the ones that maintain and fix equipment,"" Lee says. ""Every company we speak with is trying to hire technicians. Every single one. The challenge is that there is no one walking around on the street with these skills, and it takes one to two years to teach those skills and another one to two years to contextualize those skills to the specific plant environment.""

Harry Moser, the founder and president of the Reshoring Initiative, argues that America should invest much more heavily in apprenticeships to build the manufacturing workforce of the future. Apprenticeships provide young people with pathways to learn vocational skills without having to obtain an expensive, four-year college degree. Moser says that American leaders have overemphasized college to the detriment of vocational training and that the U.S. system of apprenticeships pales in comparison with the ones in countries like Germany and Switzerland.

According to Third Way, a centrist think tank, in 2022 only 0.3% of the American working-age population was in apprenticeship programs. For comparison, in Switzerland, that figure was 3.6%, or 12 times higher.

Sponsor Message

Apprenticeships and other means to help Americans obtain vocational skills may be especially important for the high-tech manufacturing jobs we have today. Lee says today's manufacturing jobs often require some combination of ""knowledge of electrical systems, mechanical systems, logic controllers, hydraulic power and robotics.""

The Manufacturing Institute has been working to develop better apprenticeship programs to help Americans build the skills the manufacturing sector needs. "" The very best models of workforce development that we see and that we engage in at the Manufacturing Institute are locally and regionally led public-private partnerships, where manufacturers come to the table and — with the support of the community college system and the local business community — they build the talent pipelines that they need,"" Lee says.

Lee told us about one particular apprenticeship program that she's very excited about. It's called the Federation for Advanced Manufacturing Education (FAME).

FAME was founded by Toyota back in 2010. The car company had trouble finding machine technicians at their manufacturing plant in Georgetown, Kentucky. So it did something proactive: It partnered with other local companies and a community college and developed an apprenticeship program to create the workforce they needed.

Lee says FAME is a 21-month program in which students juggle work and school. Each week, they spend three days at the factory and two days at a community college, learning how to operate and repair high-tech equipment, as well as other crucial skills.

""And at the end of the 21 months, students come out with, in most cases, no college debt,"" Lee says. These students also see dramatically higher earning potential.

One study, by the Brookings Institution and Opportunity America, found much higher graduation rates for students who entered the FAME program. ""Earnings and employment gaps were if anything more pronounced,"" the authors wrote. ""Five years after completion, FAME graduates were earning nearly $98,000, compared to roughly $52,783 for non-FAME participants — a difference of more than $45,000 a year."" It pays to have scarce, in-demand skills.

Lee says that FAME has become a model of workforce development for other manufacturing companies. In 2019, she says, Toyota ""recognized 'we're a car company, not an apprenticeship-operating company,'"" so it handed the program over to the Manufacturing Institute to expand it around the country.

All the sources we spoke to agreed that the government and businesses need to do more to invest in programs like these to provide opportunities to Americans and develop the workforce that the manufacturing industry needs.

""As we go from this period of declining jobs to expanding jobs, we shouldn't expect that we're just gonna automatically reincorporate all that labor overnight,"" Hanson says. ""It takes a workforce system to make it happen.""

Late last month, Trump issued an executive order aimed at ""preparing Americans for high-paying skilled trade jobs of the future."" Trump ordered various administration officials to create ""a plan to reach and surpass 1 million new active apprentices.""

We'll be watching to see what the details of this plan are and whether that plan becomes action.

But what is clear is that bringing American manufacturing roaring back will likely require more than just slapping up tariffs or investing lots of money to build new factories. Leaders may need to regear our education system to help more Americans acquire the skills that manufacturers need for a productive and capable workforce.

This brings us to an even bigger question: What warrants all these interventions to boost one particular sector of the economy? Is manufacturing actually special? And, if so, what makes it so special? That's next week in the Planet Money newsletter.","Why aren't Americans filling the manufacturing jobs we already have?

The apparel retailer said it expects revenue in the first quarter, which ended in early May, to be around $1.1 billion, a decline of about 5% compared to the prior-year period. American Eagle anticipates comparable sales will drop 3%, led by an expected 4% decline at intimates brand Aerie. American Eagle previously expected first-quarter sales to be down by a mid-single-digit percentage and anticipated full-year sales would drop by a low single-digit percentage.

Shares plunged more than 17% in extended trading.

When it reported fiscal fourth-quarter results in March, American Eagle warned that the first quarter was off to a ""slower than expected"" start, due to weak demand and cold weather. Conditions evidently worsened as the quarter progressed, and the retailer turned to steep discounts to move inventory.

As a result, American Eagle is expecting to see an operating loss of around $85 million and an adjusted operating loss, which cuts out one-time charges related to its restructuring, of about $68 million for the quarter. That loss reflects ""higher than planned"" discounting and a $75 million inventory charge related to a write-down of spring and summer merchandise, the company said.

""We are clearly disappointed with our execution in the first quarter. Merchandising strategies did not drive the results we anticipated, leading to higher promotions and excess inventory. As a result, we have taken an inventory write down on spring and summer goods,"" said CEO Jay Schottenstein.

""We have entered the second quarter in a better position, with inventory more aligned to sales trends,"" he said. ""Additionally, we are actively evaluating our forward plans. Our teams continue to work with urgency to strengthen product performance, while improving our buying principles.""

The company added it is withdrawing its fiscal 2025 guidance ""due to macro uncertainty and as management reviews forward plans in the context of first quarter results."" It is unclear if recent tariff policy changes had an effect on American Eagle.

Some companies bought inventory earlier than usual to plan for higher duties, but American Eagle repeatedly said in March that it was in a solid inventory position and was able to go after trends as customer preferences shifted.

At the start of the first quarter, the company said it had some inventory outages and needed to supplement stock in a few key categories, particularly at Aerie, one of its primary growth drivers.","American Eagle anticipates comparable sales will drop 3%, led by an expected 4% decline at intimates brand Aerie.

UnitedHealth Group abruptly replaced CEO Andrew Witty on Tuesday, as the sweeping problems facing the company and industry deepened.

Witty resigned ""for personal reasons,"" UnitedHealth said. He was replaced, effective immediately, by the company's former CEO and current chairman, Stephen J. Hemsley. A UnitedHealth spokesperson declined to comment further.

Shares in UnitedHealth plunged more than 16% by late morning Tuesday.

The massive health care conglomerate is one of the largest companies in the world — and, recently, one of the most publicly troubled. It owns Change Healthcare, a payments processor used by hospitals, doctors and pharmacists. A massive cyberattack last year paralyzed swaths of the entire U.S. health care system, affecting an estimated 100 million people.

A killing that shocked the country

It also owns UnitedHealthcare, the largest U.S. health insurer, whose CEO, Brian Thompson, was shot and killed in Manhattan in December.

The killing sparked a widespread consumer backlash over the high costs and denied claims of U.S. health care. The alleged shooter, Luigi Mangione, is facing the death penalty and has pleaded not guilty to four federal charges.

The fury against health insurers is so pervasive that some people view Mangione as a vigilante folk hero. An online fundraiser for his legal costs has raised more than $1 million.

Since December, Witty has tried to address some of the anger against his company and his industry. ""We understand and share the desire to build a health care system that works better for everyone,"" he wrote in a New York Times op-ed in December.

Big Health Care's financial problems are mounting

But ultimately, it was UnitedHealth's worsening financial problems that appeared to end Witty's four-year tenure. The company and its competitors have been facing rising costs in the Medicare Advantage businesses that allow private insurers to collect government payments for managing the care of seniors. These programs were once widely seen as money-makers for big health insurers.

But now Medicare-related problems appear to have cost multiple big health care CEOs their jobs. CVS Health, the owner of Aetna and one of UnitedHealth's top competitors, in October abruptly replaced its CEO, Karen Lynch.

UnitedHealth on Tuesday also said it was suspending its 2025 outlook, ""as care activity continued to accelerate."" UnitedHealth also said it was facing ""higher than expected"" medical costs in its Medicare Advantage business.

In other words: The senior citizens that UnitedHealth insures through its large Medicare business are going to the doctor more than expected, increasing the company's costs of providing care.","UnitedHealth Group abruptly replaces CEO Andrew Witty, deepening a terrible yeartoggle caption Kent Nishimura/Getty Images/Getty Images North AmericaUnitedHealth Group abruptly replaced CEO Andrew Witty on Tuesday, as the sweeping problems facing the company and industry deepened.

The new layoffs will bring Nissan’s total workforce reduction to around 20,000 jobs, after it previously announced plans to cut 9,000 positions.

Nissan saw its profit almost wiped out in the financial year just ended. Operating profit totaled 69.8 billion yen ($472 million) in the 12 months to March, a decline of 88% from the previous year.

Nissan has been badly damaged by weakening sales in the United States and China, then saw merger talks with Honda (HMC) collapse and was recently forced to replace its chief executive. Like rivals, it is also being squeezed by US tariffs and threatened by fast-rising Chinese electric vehicle makers in markets in Southeast Asia and elsewhere.

New CEO Ivan Espinosa now faces the difficult job of turning around an automaker that has seen its once-mighty brand value eroded.

The results were a “wake-up call,” he said at a press conference. Still, a sudden turnaround seems unlikely – the automaker expects a 200 billion yen operating loss in the first quarter, CFO Jeremie Papin said.

Analysts have said Nissan is now paying the price for years under former Chairman Carlos Ghosn when it focused too heavily on sales volume and used heavy discounts to keep cars moving off lots. That has left it with an aging line-up that it is now scrambling to update.

Espinosa said Nissan must prioritize self-improvement with greater urgency and speed, and aim for profitability by relying less on volume.

It is aiming for total cost savings of 500 billion yen versus the 2024 financial year. This will see it cut the number of its production plants to 10 from 17 and reduce the complexity of parts by 70%.","The new layoffs will bring Nissan’s total workforce reduction to around 20,000 jobs, after it previously announced plans to cut 9,000 positions.

This marked the lowest annual increase since February 2021, before a large increase in inflation sparked a Federal Reserve interest rate hiking cycle.

On a month-over-month basis, prices increased 0.2%, lower than the 0.3% estimated by economists. Prices fell 0.1% on a monthly basis in March by comparison. A 0.3% rise in the index for shelter accounted for more than half of the all items increase, per the BLS.

""The areas where tariffs likely boosted prices in April were in furniture/bedding, appliances, and to a lesser extent toys.""

Toy prices increased 0.3% after falling in three of the previous four months. Meanwhile, furniture and bedding prices rose 1.5%. Appliance costs popped 0.8%.

On a ""core"" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, prices in April climbed 0.2% over the prior month, ahead of March's 0.1% rise but below consensus projections for a 0.3% increase. Over the last year, core prices rose 2.8%, unchanged from the prior month and in line with Wall Street's expectations.

The CPI report greets investors less than 24 hours after markets soared on news that the US and China have placed a 90-day pause on a wide swath of tariffs between the two countries.

NBC is adding Michael Jordan to its National Basketball Association coverage.

The network announced on Monday at its Upfront presentation that Jordan will join the network as a special contributor to NBA broadcasts.

""I am so excited to see the NBA back on NBC,"" Jordan said in a video alongside the announcement. ""The NBA on NBC was a meaningful part of my career, and I'm excited about being a special contributor to the project. I'm looking forward to seeing you all when the NBA on NBC launches this October.""

It is unclear what Jordan's exact role will be. A person familiar with the matter told CNBC the basketball legend will not be a ""regular"" in the lineup but will appear throughout the season.

In July, NBC inked an 11-year deal with the NBA to broadcast games across NBC Sports and Peacock starting this fall.

Jordan's agreement with NBC marks his first partnership with a major broadcaster since his retirement from the court in 2003.

The 14-time NBA All-Star has since focused on his business career, first as owner of the Charlotte Hornets and later as a NASCAR owner of 23XI Racing.

NBC Sports President Rick Cordella told CNBC Sport last month that NBC was looking to bring back a blend of that '90s nostalgia to NBA viewers.

The network has also once again tapped into the music of John Tesh, composer of ""Roundball Rock,"" a popular anthem that gained notoriety with NBC basketball in the '90s.

Cordella also said NBC will bring back player introductions to the broadcast in an effort to show off the atmosphere.

Jamal Crawford, Reggie Miller, Carmelo Anthony, Mike Tirico and Noah Eagle will also be part of NBC's NBA broadcast this fall, as well as the use of an artificial intelligence-generated voice of the late Jim Fagan.

The deal offers hope for a permanent trade deal, but there is little clarity on what Americans will actually get out of it.

Under the deal, the U.S. will cut its 145% tariff on Chinese goods down to 30%, while China will lower its own tariff on U.S. imports to 10%, down from 125%. Both sides described the agreement as a pause to keep talks going — not a resolution.

Officials from both countries met over the weekend in Geneva to work out the details. At a press conference, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the message from both sides was clear: “Neither side wanted a decoupling.”

Trump also softened his tone on Monday, telling reporters, “We’re not looking to hurt China.”

That’s in stark contrast to his tough talk during the April 2 “Liberation Day” press conference, when he unveiled the 145% tariff.

Kelly Ann Shaw, a former White House economic adviser under Trump, told Reuters the move shows the president is simply following through.

“He is doing what he said he would,” she said. “This is absolutely about resolving disparities in the trading relationship.”

But many online — including economists, former officials, and political strategists — saw it differently.

“China has agreed to nothing,” said economist Peter Schiff on X. “If 145% tariffs were just a bargaining chip, China already called Trump’s bluff and won.”

Others pointed out that Trump gave up the threat of high tariffs without winning any clear concessions in return.

“I guess all those manufacturing jobs aren’t coming here now,” wrote former federal prosecutor Ron Filipkowski. “So much for Liberation Day.”

What did the tariffs actually accomplish?

Economist Justin Wolfers told MSNBC that the best outcome would be to roll back Trump’s trade policy altogether.

“The single best thing that could happen is if we went back to the trade policy we had on January 20,” referring to Trump’s first day in office.

Wolfers noted that most wealthy countries have spent decades reducing tariffs, with average rates now around 1–2%. From that perspective, Trump’s tariff policy was fighting a battle the rest of the world had already moved past.

Peter Berezin, chief strategist at BCA Research, added that China effectively got the same 10% tariff rate and 90-day extension as other countries that pushed back on Trump’s trade measures without giving anything up.

“I don’t see how that strengthens Trump’s hand in future negotiations,” he wrote.

Democratic strategist Matt McDermott said the White House still hasn’t delivered on its central promise: bringing factory jobs back to the U.S.

In the meantime, Americans are stuck with a 30% import tax, which eventually gets passed on to consumers. “Trump caved and got zero in return,” McDermott wrote.

Fox Business reporter Charles Gasparino said the Trump administration backed down because the markets — especially the bond market — started pushing back too much.

“What we have seen is a little lesson on how markets exert their power,” Gasparino wrote. “You can't go to trade war with the world without bad stuff happening.”","The deal offers hope for a permanent trade deal, but there is little clarity on what Americans will actually get out of it.

This amount fits inside the $4.5 trillion budget threshold previously agreed by Congress in its fiscal framework, allowing the House Ways and Means Committee to make amendments that will increase the national deficit.

According to the JCT’s detailed tables, maintaining Trump-era tax cuts, which were first offered in 2017, as well as various other fiscal ideas, will increase the national deficit by nearly $5 trillion.

However, these expenses would be substantially offset by around $2 trillion in savings resulting from reduced renewable energy incentives and more vigorous international tax enforcement. These values are compared to the Congressional Budget Office’s (CBO) January 2025 baseline predictions.

Republicans have had mixed reactions to the proposal, w hile some remain cautiously supportive, others, particularly fiscal conservatives, express concern about the growing deficit. Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX) highlighted the need for additional improvements before expressing his full support.

“I remain open-minded because progress has been made based on our forceful efforts to force change,” Roy stated. “But we cannot continue down the path we’ve been going down.”

At the heart of the GOP proposal is the extension of individual income tax rate reductions from the 2017 Trump tax cuts. These reduced marginal tax rates, set at 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, and 37%, are projected to slash federal revenues by $2.2 trillion over the next 10 years.

Maintaining the increased standard deduction $29,200 for married couples and $14,600 for individuals in 2024, will cost another $1.3 trillion. However, JCT notes that the elimination of personal exemptions helped offset those costs, adding $1.8 trillion in revenue through 2034.

Another expensive element is the extension of the alternative minimum tax (AMT) exemption, which alone could reduce federal revenues by $1.4 trillion.

The package also includes an expansion of the child tax credit (CTC), expected to cost $800 billion, and enhanced deductions for pass-through businesses, priced at $700 billion.

Other proposed tax reliefs include:

$40 billion for eliminating taxes on tips,

$124 billion for removing taxes on overtime,

$71 billion for a new senior deduction, and

$57 billion for excluding car loan interest from taxable income.

Meanwhile, modest revenue increases are expected from modifications to the Earned Income Tax Credit, projected to bring in $15 billion, and stepped-up international tax enforcement, expected to yield $116 billion.

Significant federal savings will also come from reversing clean energy initiatives under the Inflation Reduction Act. Key cuts include:

$78 billion by terminating the clean vehicle credit,

$104 billion by removing the commercial clean vehicle credit, and

$154 billion by canceling the clean electricity investment credit.

Although the bill offers a range of tax breaks and seeks to solidify Trump’s 2017 tax vision, the JCT report highlights the substantial fiscal implications that could reignite deficit concerns among both parties.","According to the JCT’s detailed tables, maintaining Trump-era tax cuts, which were first offered in 2017, as well as various other fiscal ideas, will increase the national deficit by nearly $5 trillion.

Trump also announced at an investment forum in Riyadh that he will order the removal of all U.S. sanctions against Syria, ""in order to give them a chance at greatness.""

Trump's speech at the investment conference followed him signing several bilateral agreements during a state visit with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

Among the agreements secured is a nearly $142 billion defense sales deal, providing the kingdom with ""state-of-the-art warfighting equipment and services from over a dozen U.S. defense firms,"" the White House said.

That commitment is nearly double Saudi Arabia's 2025 defense budget, which totaled $78 billion.

TORONTO--Honda Canada will postpone a $15-billion Canadian (US$10.7 billion) electric vehicle investment project in Canada's most populous province, including a proposed EV battery plant and retooled vehicle assembly facility.

Honda Canada spokesman Ken Chiu said Tuesday due to the recent slowdown in the EV market, Honda has announced an approximate two-year postponement of the comprehensive value chain investment project in Ontario.

“The company will continue to evaluate the timing and project progression as market conditions change,” Chiu said in a statement.

The decision has no impact on current employment at the Honda manufacturing plant in Alliston, Ontario, he added.

Honda’s EV project in Canada includes a retooled assembly plant, an electric vehicle battery plant in close proximity, as well as two key battery parts facilities located elsewhere in Ontario.

The project was expected to see the two main plants create 1,000 jobs on top of retaining the existing 4,200 jobs at the assembly plant.

Under the original plan, the plant was set to produce up to 240,000 vehicles per year when fully operational in 2028.

Ottawa was set to give the Japanese automaker around $2.5 billion Canadian (US$1.8 billion) through tax credits, while Ontario committed to providing up to $2.5 billion Canadian (US$1.8 billion) in support directly and indirectly.

Before 1995, workers in China only had one day off per week. Weekends, as they are understood today, simply didn't exist for the 1.2 billion Chinese population.

That changed when then-premier Li Peng issued a directive to align China's labour standards with international norms, facilitating its bid to join the World Trade Organization (WTO).

The policy shift marked a significant change in everyday life — an early and powerful example of how the Chinese government can reshape the rhythm of society overnight to serve strategic goals.

It symbolised Beijing's willingness to use its power to change the lifestyle of everyone in the country, as one of the outcomes of its 15-year negotiation with the United States.

The breakthrough of the working-hour system in China not just enhanced Beijing's will to open its door to the global market.

It was a symbol of adaptation — a gesture to a rules-based global economy.

But it also laid the foundations for today's differences with the US — tensions rooted in structural mismatches over trade, regulation and state power.

While the 90-day tariff truce between China and the US is seen as a relief and an optimistic message for the world, at the heart of the stand-off is a clash between fundamentally different systems.

The US increasingly views trade policy through a national security lens, aiming to reduce dependency on foreign supply chains, particularly those involving China.

Conversely, China remains committed to a model of state-led capitalism that prioritises global manufacturing dominance.

What's unfolding now is not a negotiation between equals, but a contest over who sets the rules — and whose system can withstand the pressure.

It's a clash of Xi Jinping's Chinese Dream and Donald Trump's America First.

Strategic goods and strategic thinking

Trade is no longer just about economics for the US — it has become a central part of its national security strategy.

The supply chain crisis during the COVID-19 pandemic exposed the fragility of relying on a single country — particularly China — for critical goods like pharmaceuticals and medical equipment.

In response, Washington has moved aggressively to ""de-risk"" and re-shore industries deemed strategic, including semiconductors, rare earths, and clean energy components.

The Biden administration's CHIPS and Science Act and Inflation Reduction Act are designed with this in mind: to reduce reliance on Chinese supply chains and invest in domestic capacity.

The logic is straightforward — if a geopolitical rival controls your access to essential goods, your security is compromised.

That logic now underpins bipartisan consensus in Washington. The Pentagon, the Commerce Department, and even Treasury are aligned in this approach.

Meanwhile, China continues to rely on the US to maintain its global trade dominance. The US remains one of China's largest export markets.

Access to the US not only brings revenue but also legitimises China's role in global commerce.

Since joining the WTO in 2001, China has used its manufacturing strength to climb the value chain, becoming the world's factory. But with that rise has come growing scrutiny.

At the core of the issue is how China uses its state apparatus to direct entire industries.

The Party can create a sector seemingly overnight — from solar panels to electric vehicles — through massive subsidies, cheap land, tax incentives, and government procurement.

The solar industry is one of the starkest examples.

In the early 2000s, Beijing picked it as a strategic priority. Within years, Chinese firms, backed by billions in subsidies, flooded the global market with low-cost panels, undercutting foreign competitors and forcing several Western manufacturers into bankruptcy.

The same playbook is now being applied to electric vehicles and battery technology.

But the Chinese system doesn't just build industries — it can also destroy them. Once state subsidies are withdrawn or redirected, whole sectors can collapse.

For domestic and international players alike, the uncertainty generated by this top-down industrial policy is a risk.

This dynamic — of building with the state and eroding competition through state support — has angered not only the US, but also the EU, Canada, and others.

State subsidies have enabled Chinese solar panel manufacturers to dominate the global market. ( Reuters: China Daily )

WTO promises and political realities

The US has long accused China of failing to fulfil its WTO commitments.

These include promises to reduce subsidies, increase market access, and protect intellectual property.

However, over the years, Beijing has doubled down on support for state-owned and strategically chosen enterprises.

Despite entering the WTO as a developing country, China now dominates sectors it once pledged to liberalise.

In areas like digital trade and cloud services, the barriers to foreign firms remain high, while Chinese companies enjoy global access and home-market protection.

For Washington, this is no longer just about economics — it's about rules, reciprocity, and the contract of trust.

Trade deficits can be tolerated; systemic manipulation cannot.

That's why, even with a temporary tariff easing, the tone in Washington remains sceptical.

The current round of tariffs is broader than the last.

America's global tariff hikes are supposed to stop Chinese firms rerouting goods through other countries. ( Reuters: Florence Lo )

""This time, unlike the first round, is not purely targeting China, but imposes tariffs on nearly all countries around the world,"" Australian economist Shi Heling said.

""Firstly, to prevent China from rerouting exports through third countries into the US.

""Secondly, this is no longer just economic competition — it's a mix of economic and national security concerns. Ultimately, it's about who controls the supply chains.""

On the Chinese side, there is deep resistance to changing course.

Under Xi Jinping, the role of the Party in economic life has only strengthened.

Private firms are now expected to align with state goals. National champions like Huawei and BYD are not just businesses — they are arms of Beijing's broader global ambition.

The Belt and Road Initiative, too, is part of this strategy: to shape global economic flows in ways that favour Beijing's economic influence and geopolitical leadership.

So while China wants access to the US market to maintain growth, legitimacy, and influence, it's unwilling to concede control.

The ideological difference is stark.

In the West, competition is seen as a process governed by rules and independent oversight.

In China, the outcome — national strength — justifies the means.

""Both countries need reform,"" Shi said.

""China should stop giving companies excessive subsidies. Its economic policy is not built on a fair system — but on doing whatever it takes to crush competitors.

""The US should focus on the fiscal deficit and public debt. Even after the 90-day truce ends, major structural issues will remain.""

Australia and the regional balancing act

Even within the Asia-Pacific, this tension is playing out.

Countries like Japan, Indonesia and Malaysia, which once emulated aspects of China's state-driven model, are increasingly distancing themselves.

As their economies mature, they recognise the need to reduce market distortions and avoid over-reliance on a single dominant player.

This growing scepticism toward China's approach reflects a broader unease in the region.

In this context, the 90-day pause looks less like a breakthrough and more like a holding pattern.

It buys time — politically useful for both Trump and Xi, given the domestic pressures. But it postpones rather than resolves the conflict.

For Australia, this presents both risks and opportunities.

The trade relationship with China is strong, largely due to complementary rather than competitive industries.

But Canberra faces a strategic dilemma.

Economically, it can benefit from global supply chain shifts and Chinese demand.

Politically and militarily, it is tied closely to the US and must respond to the changing security environment.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese will ultimately have to choose a side between national security and economic gains.

Australia stands to benefit economically from the rising geopolitical rivalry between China and the US.

""China and Australia have strong industrial complementarity and relatively low direct competition,"" Shi said.

""Compared with other countries, trade difficulties between China and Australia will be less.""","The US increasingly views trade policy through a national security lens, aiming to reduce dependency on foreign supply chains, particularly those involving China.

But economists don’t expect that to last,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Inflation cooled for the third straight month in April even after some of President Donald Trump’s tariffs took effect, though economists and many business owners expect inflation will climb by this summer.

Consumer prices rose 2.3% in April from a year ago, the Labor Department said Tuesday, down from 2.4% in March and the smallest increase in more than four years. On a monthly basis, prices rose modestly, increasing 0.2% from March to April after falling 0.1% the previous month, the first drop in five years.

Grocery prices dipped 0.4% from March to April in what will come as a relief to many people stretching family budgets for the basics. It was the biggest decline in food costs at home since September 2020, the government said. Egg prices fell sharply, declining 12.7%, the most in 41 years. Yet they are still 49% higher than a year ago.

Overall, the report suggests tariffs haven’t yet impacted prices for many items. Economists say the impact will more likely be seen by June or July. The 10% tariff on all goods that took effect April 5 could take two to three months to feed into the inflation data. And many companies built stockpiles of products earlier this year, enabling them to delay price hikes in hopes that the trade war will cool.

The cost of clothing, which is mostly imported, declined 0.2% from March to April, Tuesday’s report said. New car prices were unchanged. And grocery prices fell despite fears that tariffs on some goods from Mexico would boost food costs.

“It’s early days for tariff effects,” said Laura Rosner-Warburton, co-founder of MacroPolicy Perspectives and formerly an economist at the Federal Reserve’s New York branch. “More will come in May, June, and July. There are plenty of price increases already scheduled and on the way.”

And there were some early signs that the duties are having an impact. Computer prices rose 0.3% from March to April, a category that is heavily imported from China and usually sees mild price declines. Sporting goods and toys, where many products are imported, also saw increases. And a category that includes baby strollers and car seats also got more expensive.

Still, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices were also muted, rising 2.8% in April compared with a year ago, the same as in March. On a monthly basis, they increased a mild 0.2%. Economists watch core prices because they typically provide a better read on where inflation is headed.

Rosner-Warburton noted that some prices fell as business weakened, particularly in travel. Air fares and hotel prices dropped noticeably last month, contributing to lower inflation, but that may have been driven by a decline in foreign visitors to the U.S.

Some companies have raised prices and others have said they plan to do so as a result of the duties. Mattel Inc., the maker of Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels cars, said earlier this month it would have to raise prices on some products. The company makes 40% of its products in China.

Tool maker Stanley Black & Decker said it raised prices in April and plans to do so again in the July-September quarter because of higher tariffs. And executives at Procter & Gamble, the consumer products giant that makes household name brands such as Crest toothpaste, Tide detergent, and Charmin toilet paper, said last month it will likely have to pass on higher prices to consumers as soon as July.

Only some early tariffs imposed by Trump were in effect in April, including 25% duties on steel and aluminum and 25% on some imports from Canada and Mexico. Trump’s initial 20% import taxes on goods from China were also in place. The steel and aluminum duties will take time to feed through into consumer products, such as cars, and may not affect retail prices for months.

Trump’s huge 145% import taxes on Chinese goods were reduced to 30% in a deal announced Monday, with some of the higher tariffs on pause for 90 days. Retailers and importers had largely stopped shipping shoes, clothes, toys, and other items when the duties were so high, but many will now resume importing from China, which should reduce the chances of empty shelves this fall.

Yet the additional 30% duties, on top of other import taxes, will likely affect prices. The Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, a trade group, says children’s shoes from China will now pay a nearly 100% tariff, because the latest duties are on top of previous import taxes.

Matt Priest, president and CEO of the FDRA, said that the cost of shipping goods from China will likely rise as many companies scramble to get orders to the U.S. during the 90-day window.

“We’re not out of the inflationary cost woods yet,” he said.

And economists say average tariffs are now at about 18%, roughly six times higher than before Trump took office and the highest in about 90 years.

Consumer prices cooled noticeably in February and March, prompting Trump to claim repeatedly on social media that there is “NO INFLATION.” Inflation has fallen to nearly the 2% target set by the Federal Reserve, the agency charged with fighting higher prices.

The Fed would have likely been gearing up to restart interest rate cuts in the absence of tariffs because inflation is down. It reduced its benchmark rate three times last year. However, it has since frozen rates while it awaits further evidence of how the tariffs — and other policy changes, such as immigration restrictions and potential tax cuts — affect the economy.

The smaller import taxes on Chinese goods will limit the damage to the U.S. economy, but combined with all the other tariffs, economists forecast they will still slow growth this year and worsen inflation.

The Yale Budget Lab, for example, estimates the tariffs will lift prices 1.7% and cost the average household about $2,800 this year.

“This is still a very, very substantial tariff hike, but it will take awhile” to show up in the inflation data, Alan Detmeister, an economist at UBS, said.

Many small businesses are relieved that the U.S. has cut its tariffs on goods from China but say they still aren’t sure what their costs will be for the remainder of this year, or whether they can avoid raising prices themselves.

Rick Woldenberg, CEO of Learning Resources, an educational toy company, said that the 145% tariffs would have pushed his tariff bill to $100.2 million from $2.3 million last year.

He paused shipments and production but is now strategizing how to work with the lower tariffs. He has 13 containers stored in warehouses in Los Angeles, which allows importers to defer duty payments for up to five years. And he may bring $11 million of goods from China and pay the 30% tariffs, but he’s not sure how to price them.

“We just don’t know what our costs are,” he said. “We do not know what our tariff costs are. We do not know what our freight costs are.”

Six in 10 Americans said the economy has affected at least one of their major life goals, according to the Harris poll, citing either lack of affordability or anxiety around the current economy.

Though Donald Trump’s tariff policies have only been in place for a few weeks, and though the president has temporarily walked back on some of his harshest policies, the findings are a sign that Trump’s economic agenda could have long-term effects.

The Trump administration has said it wants to encourage Americans to have more babies, and is floating a $5,000 “baby bonus” for new mothers. But its economic policies appear to be a major stumbling block to that ambition. Of those who originally planned to have a child in 2025, a majority say the current economy has affected their plans in some way, by either being unable to afford having a child (32%) or being uncomfortable having one in the current economy (33%).

Large percentages of those surveyed said they wanted to make major financial decision: 45% said they wanted to make a big purchase – a car, for example, or appliances – and 42% said they wanted to buy a house.

But 75% of those who said they wanted to buy a home said the current economy had derailed them.

Buying a home has long been seen as the benchmark for the American dream, but has become increasingly unaffordable for many Americans.

Home prices rocketed after a buying frenzy during the pandemic, when interest rates were at zero, and have not come down since. Though mortgage rates have fallen slightly since their recent peak of about 7.5%, the average 30-year mortgage rate in March was 6.7% – more than double what it was four years ago.

The economic anxiety disproportionately affects the long-term goals of younger Americans, who are less likely to own a home already, be married or have kids. A majority of Gen Z and millennials renters (68%), for example, said they had a goal of buying a house, compared to just 29% of renters who are older.

Much of the instability appears to come from the rising cost of living: 65% of Americans said they thought the cost of living had worsened since the start of the year, and half said it had made it more difficult to afford their living expenses.

A vast majority (78%) said they had noticed increased grocery prices over the last few months, while 60% said they had also noticed monthly bills and everyday essentials getting more expensive.

Although nearly half (48%) of Republicans said the cost of living has gone up this year, Republicans appear to be more optimistic about the overall state of the economy, particularly compared to when Joe Biden was in the White House.

When respondents were asked last May whether they thought the US was experiencing a recession, 67% of Republicans said they believed the country was in a recession. Nearly a year later, the number has dropped to 40% of Republicans.

On the other hand, 49% of Democrats believed the country was in a recession last May, compared with 59% who think the US is in a recession now. The US is not in recession and has not been since February to April 2020, during the Covid pandemic.

Perhaps most concerning for Trump is that although only 33% of Republicans believe the US economy is worsening, 64% of independents believe it is getting worse, more in line with Democrats (73%). More independents believed that the economy was in a recession last May (53%) compared to this April (46%), though the switch in opinion is much smaller than for Republicans.

Though Trump has said that his tariffs will “make America wealthy again”, it appears few Americans believe him.

Tariffs came out on top in a list of things that Americans believe will most likely hurt their household financially in 2025. Nearly a third (29%) of respondents, including 39% of Democrats, 28% of independents and 21% of Republicans, said that tariffs will do the most harm. Over 20% said that government policies will be the most harmful, including 24% of independents.","Americans are reconsidering major life events including marriage, having children and buying a home amid economic anxiety in the opening months of the Trump presidency, according to an exclusive poll for the Guardian.
Six in 10 Americans said the economy has affected at least one of their major life goals, according to the Harris poll, citing either lack of affordability or anxiety around the current economy.
The Trump administration has said it wants to encourage Americans to have more babies, and is floating a $5,000 “baby bonus” for new mothers.

Poll Which approach do you think is more effective in resolving international disputes? Mediation by third-party nations Bilateral talks between involved parties

NEW DELHI: India on Tuesday reiterated its rejection of US President Donald Trump's offer to mediate in the dispute with Pakistan over J&K, and said India had a long-standing national position that any issue pertaining to the Union Territory would be addressed by India and Pakistan bilaterally.""That stated policy has not changed. As you are aware, the outstanding matter is the vacation of illegally occupied Indian territory by Pakistan,"" MEA said when asked about Trump's offer.Government also rejected the US president's claim that he had threatened to stop trade with India and Pakistan to get them to agree to a ""ceasefire"".Also read: 'No mention of trade in India-US talks during India-Pakistan crisis' ""From the time Op Sindoor started on May 7 till the understanding on cessation of military action on May 10, there were conversations between Indian and US leaders on the evolving military situation. The issue of trade did not come up in any of these discussions,"" MEA said.Also, with Trump claiming that he had averted a nuclear war, govt said India's military action was entirely in the conventional domain and warned other countries not to get carried away by Pakistan's nuclear bluff.While there were reports that Pakistan's National Command Authority, which is responsible for the country's nuclear arsenal, would meet on May 10, govt recalled that Islamabad had later on record denied any ""nuclear angle"". May 10 was the day India pounded 8-10 airbases in Pakistan, forcing Pakistan to seek a DGMO-level dialogue.India's armed forces have denied they hit a nuclear site at Kirana Hills, debunking reports about a radioactive leak there. PM Narendra Modi had said on Monday that India would not tolerate any nuclear blackmail by Pakistan.""India has a firm stance that it will not give in to nuclear blackmail or allow cross-border terrorism to be conducted invoking it. In conversations with various countries, we cautioned that their subscribing to such scenarios could hurt them in their own region,'' MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.Amid repeated claims by Trump that he had mediated a ""ceasefire"", govt reiterated that the specific date, time and wording of the understanding was worked out between the DGMOs during their phone call at 3.35 pm on Saturday. The request for this call was received by MEA from the Pakistani high commission at 1237 hours, Jaiswal said. ""The Pakistani side had initial difficulties connecting the hotline for technical reasons. The timing was then decided based on the availability of the Indian DGMO at 1535 hours,"" he added.""Early on 10th morning, we had mounted an extremely effective attack on key Pakistan Air Force bases.

2025-05-13 00:00:00,2025-05-13 00:00:00 +08,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/13/volodymyr-zelenskyy-donald-trump-vladimir-putin-peace-talks-turkey,"Trump must realise Putin is obstacle to peace, Zelenskyy says","Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he hopes the current period of frantic diplomacy and high-stakes gambits between Russia and Ukraine will end with Donald Trump understanding that Vladimir Putin is the real obstacle to a peace deal.

“Trump needs to believe that Putin actually lies. And we should do our part. Sensibly approach this issue, to show that it’s not us that is slowing down the process,” said Zelenskyy, speaking to a small group of journalists, including the Guardian, in his office at the presidential administration in Kyiv.

Zelenskyy said he would travel to Turkey on Thursday whether or not Putin flew in for talks.

Zelenskyy said he had arranged to meet with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, in Ankara, but would be ready to fly to Istanbul at a moment’s notice if the Russian leader showed up. “If Putin does not arrive and plays games, it is the final point that he does not want to end the war,” he said on Tuesday.

Previously, after Putin used an unexpected late-night Kremlin address to call for direct Russia-Ukraine negotiations in Istanbul, Zelenskyy responded by saying he would be waiting for Putin personally in Turkey on Thursday.

Trump, who is on a visit to Saudi Arabia, appeared to float the idea of a three-way meeting with Putin and Zelenskyy, saying on Monday: “I believe the two leaders are going to be there. I was thinking about flying over.”

Zelenskyy said he was hoping Trump would indeed meet him in Turkey. “If Trump travels, it will push Putin also to travel,” he said. “Trump can really help. It’s the situation where the US being present can give important guarantees.”

Trump’s Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, also suggested the potential for a three-way summit. “This could be a really great meeting … We hope that President Putin will also come, and then President Trump will be there,” he told Fox News. Kellogg, as well as the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and the envoy Steve Witkoff are also reportedly expected in Turkey.

However, there is little sign that Putin is prepared to travel. Although he has not directly ruled it out, comments from the Kremlin suggest Russia will instead send a lower-level negotiating team to Istanbul.

“Our delegation will be there and will wait for the Ukrainian side,” said Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, on Tuesday evening. The Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said Russia wanted to use any talks to address the “root causes” of the conflict as Moscow sees them, including the “denazification” of Ukraine and the official incorporation into Russia of annexed territories – suggesting that the rhetoric of the two sides is still very far apart.

Zelenskyy said he believed that without a ceasefire agreed by the leaders, there was no point in beginning lower-level talks.

“I want you to understand why I would meet with Putin. We are not going to be able to agree on everything now. It’s impossible. We have different approaches to life, different worldviews. But we have to somehow find a way to end the war,” he said. If he and Putin could agree on a ceasefire, Zelenskyy said, then lower-level groups could meet to start hammering out details of the next steps.

He pointed to previous talks in Saudi Arabia, when the Americans acted as intermediaries between Russian and Ukrainian delegations, and a lasting full ceasefire could not be agreed. “Without signals from the leaders, or a meeting of the leaders, this format doesn’t work,” he said.

However, when pressed, he refused to rule out sending a lower-level delegation to Istanbul for talks. “I don’t know. I am being honest. Maybe the Americans, maybe someone will really want to launch this format again. I don’t know,” he said.

The back-and-forth diplomacy began with a visit to Kyiv by the leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Poland on Saturday, timed symbolically to come just one day after a set-piece military parade in Moscow marking 80 years since the Soviet victory in the second world war. After speaking with Trump on the phone, the four European leaders laid down an ultimatum to Putin that he should sign up to a 30-day ceasefire by Monday or face further sanctions. Putin rejected the ultimatum, instead offering the Istanbul talks without a ceasefire.

In the event that nothing is agreed during whatever meetings take place in Turkey this week, the big question is whether the Europeans can bring Trump along with them in their plans to ratchet up the pressure on Moscow. Zelenskyy said he hoped that new sanctions would soon be on the agenda if Thursday’s meetings came to nothing.

“I believe that President Trump is not against imposing sanctions … and I believe that there is political will in Congress to vote for these sanctions. I believe the Americans are very close to imposing these sanctions,” he said. He added that consultations would take place in the coming days – “if you’ll allow me, I won’t say where or when” – in which Europeans would be briefed on upcoming US sanctions plans.

The Ukrainian president has been walking a diplomatic tightrope in recent weeks, as Kyiv tries to keep the Trump administration on side. After the disastrous White House meeting at the end of February, Zelenskyy appears to have had some success turning the relationship around, culminating in a positive meeting on the sidelines of Pope Francis’s funeral in the Vatican last month.

Asked what he had said to Trump to win him back over, Zelenskyy declined to answer: “I won’t tell you. I know the reasons; in my opinion, I know why we had such a good talk. But I can’t say, I just can’t.”

British and French officials have been speaking regularly with Ukrainian counterparts since the White House debacle and offering guidance on how to mend relations with the US administration.

Zelenskyy said the contact with European allies had been closer and more frequent than ever before, and that the French president, Emmanuel Macron, was one of “two or three” leaders whom he spoke with regularly by phone. “He has a very creative approach … He’s a risk-taker. And risk-takers can be different kinds of people, but they are all focused on results. They don’t put themselves above everything else,” Zelenskyy said.

After his visit to Turkey, Zelenskyy is expected to visit Albania for a meeting of European politicians on Friday, and then may travel to Rome, where he suggested he could attend the inaugural mass of the new pope, Leo XIV, after having a positive phone call with him earlier this week.

“I think it could happen on Sunday,” Zelenskyy said. “If it works out. We don’t know what this week will bring. We have come to the moment when we don’t know what will happen tomorrow.”","Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he hopes the current period of frantic diplomacy and high-stakes gambits between Russia and Ukraine will end with Donald Trump understanding that Vladimir Putin is the real obstacle to a peace deal.

Addressing a weekly news conference, Randhir Jaiswal, the spokesman for India’s foreign ministry, said top leaders in New Delhi and Washington were in touch last week following the Indian military’s intense standoff with Pakistan, but that there was no conversation on trade.

“The issue of trade didn’t come up in any of these discussions,” Jaiswal said, referring to the conversations held between U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as well as between U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his Indian counterpart, S. Jaishankar.

Following Saturday’s understanding between India and Pakistan to stop military action on land, in the air and at sea, Trump told reporters on Monday that he had offered to help both nations with trade if they agreed to de-escalate.

“I said, come on, we’re going to do a lot of trade with you guys. Let’s stop it. Let’s stop it. If you stop it, we’ll do a trade. If you don’t stop it, we’re not going to do any trade,’” Trump said.

“And all of a sudden, they said, I think we’re going to stop,” Trump said, crediting trade leverage for influencing both the nations’ decision. “For a lot of reasons, but trade is a big one,” he said.

The militaries of India and Pakistan had been engaged in one of their most serious confrontations in decades since last Wednesday, when India struck targets inside Pakistan it said were affiliated with militants responsible for the massacre of 26 tourists last month in Indian-controlled Kashmir. Pakistan has denied any links to the attackers.

After India’s strikes in Pakistan, the two sides exchanged heavy fire along their de facto borders, followed by missile and drone strikes into each other’s territories, mainly targeting military installations and airbases .

The escalating hostilities between the nuclear-armed rivals threatened regional peace, leading to calls by world leaders to cool down tempers.

Trump said he not only helped mediate the ceasefire, but also offered mediation over the simmering dispute in Kashmir, a Himalayan region that both India and Pakistan claim in entirety but administer in parts. The two nations have fought two wars over Kashmir, which has long been described as the regional nuclear flashpoint.

New Delhi also declined Trump’s offer for mediation on Tuesday.

“We have a longstanding national position that any issues related to the federally controlled union territory of Jammu and Kashmir must be addressed by India and Pakistan bilaterally. There has been no change to the stated policy,” Jaiswal said.

Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said late Tuesday that Pakistan was expelling a staff member of the Indian High Commission in Islamabad, accusing him of unspecified inappropriate activity and giving him 24 hours to leave the country.

In a tit-for-tat move last month, India and Pakistan reduced each other’s diplomatic presence in Islamabad and New Delhi. So far, none of the expelled diplomats have returned. Pakistan and India routinely expel each other’s diplomats over allegations of espionage.

LONDON -- Over a ton of cocaine worth close to nearly half a billion dollars has been seized from a boat off the coast of Australia, officials have confirmed.

Detectives from the Organised Crime Squad in Australia have charged five people following the seizure of the drugs from a vessel off the New South Wales coast after police there obtained potential intelligence to the drugs following a “suspicious purchase” of a 43-foot-long motor cruiser paid for by just cash in Sydney’s Sutherland Shire on April 28, according to a joint statement from the New South Wales Police Force and the Australian Federal Police (AFP).

“On Friday (9 May 2025), as the vessel travelled back to shore - towards South West Rocks - it was intercepted by the Marine Area Command about 9.30am.,” the statement said. “Two men, aged 24 and 26, were arrested on board and escorted to shore by the police vessel. They were taken to Coffs Harbour Police Station.”

Approximately 1,110 blocks of cocaine, weighing 1.039 tons were located on the vessel, police confirmed.

“The seized cocaine equates to over a million individual hits, with an estimated potential street value of $623.4 million,” (more than $400 million U.S. dollars) police said.

Three other people – aged 28, 29 and 35 - were simultaneously arrested on shore after investigators stopped two vehicles attempting to leave the South West Rocks area and they were taken to Taree Police Station.

Forensic specialists are currently examining the seized drugs and will be conducting further testing to determine the exact weight and purity of the drugs.

“The two men at Coffs Harbour were charged with supply prohibited drug - large commercial quantity and participate in criminal group,” Australian officials said. “The three men at Taree were charged with take part in supply prohibited drug - large commercial quantity and participate in criminal group.”

All five of the suspects appeared at Parramatta Bail Court on Saturday where they were all formally refused bail and mandated to appear at Coffs Harbour Local Court on July 15, authorities said.

“The AFP and NSW Police Force have a long history of disrupting criminal networks attempting to import drugs that destroy our community. Combining our resources and expertise allows us to get successful outcomes like the one we are announcing today,” AFP Assistant Commissioner Stephen Dametto said. “Australia’s vast coastline is attractive to organised crime groups, who attempt to exploit this by trying to import drugs using boats. The bad news for them is the AFP will continue to work together with our partners to target organised crime syndicates who wrongly believe they can operate with impunity.

NSW Police State Crime Commander, Acting Assistant Commissioner Jason Weinstein said these arrests are testament to how rapidly our policing resources can coordinate and stop significant amounts of drug coming into NSW.

“Whether on land or sea, NSW Police have the investigative capability to disrupt and undermine criminal enterprise,” Weinstein said. ""This seizure shows how our continuous monitoring of known organised crime methodologies with industry partners, can be actioned into a successful multi-agency operation with those involved immediately arrested to prevent illicit drugs entering NSW. Our ability to pivot and protect the community is evident in this week’s actions. Make no mistake these drugs, if allowed to enter our communities, would have had devastating impacts on people’s lives and social cohesion, particularly in regional townships.”

The higher education minister, James Lawless, will on Tuesday seek cabinet approval for a “global talent initiative” to entice top international academics, including those seeking to leave the US or deterred from working there.

The plan envisages deploying roving academic talent scouts who will offer potential recruits attractive packages, with the Irish government contributing up to half of the salaries offered by Ireland’s third-level institutions. The talent hunt will reportedly prioritise experts in renewable energy, food security, digital technology, artificial intelligence, semiconductors and healthcare.

Lawless told an Irish universities association seminar on Monday: “Today, as US research freedoms come under threat, Ireland has a unique opportunity to emulate their post-war success by offering a stable, open, EU-aligned environment where world-class researchers can thrive, contribute and shape the future of science. Ireland will be a welcoming host for the best and brightest fleeing the US university system.”

Perceptions of the US as a haven for research had changed in recent months, the minister said. “It has become a cold place for free thinkers and talented researchers. We all know how that will grind advanced research to a halt. And that is nothing in the face of the human suffering of targeted student arrests and deportations”. Reports of library culls “bring to mind book burnings of old”, he said.

As a precedent Lawless cited Ireland’s success in enticing Erwin Schrödinger to Dublin on the eve of the second world war. The Austrian physicist helped to set up the Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies (DIAS).

The Irish scheme follows efforts by Belgium’s Vrije Universiteit Brussel, France’s Pasteur Institute and other European institutions to recruit US researchers by offering themselves as a haven for those keen to escape a White House crackdown on research and academia. In March the Netherlands said it planned to launch a fund to attract researchers.

The Trump administration has frozen billions in federal funds for research under in the name of efficiency and punishing alleged anti-semitism and other transgressions in academia. It has been called an “RMS Titanic moment” for American higher education.

The migration of talent might initially benefit only individual, high-profile researchers but there would be an economic effect, Cas Mudde, the Stanley Wade Shelton UGAF professor of international affairs at the University of Georgia, recently wrote in the Guardian. “That might force even the Trump administration to change course.”","Ireland is to launch a scheme to poach academics and university lecturers from overseas on the basis that the Trump administration has made the US “a cold place for free thinkers and talented researchers”.

A full and immediate ceasefire between India and Pakistan was announced on May 10 after days of heightened military exchanges that brought both nuclear-armed neighbours to the brink of war.

The announcement was first made by US President Donald Trump and later confirmed by Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

Tensions flared following an April 22 attack in Pahalgam, Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK), which left 26 civilians dead.

India blamed Pakistan-based elements without presenting any evidence, Islamabad rejected the allegations. In response, India closed the Wagah border, revoked visas, and suspended the Indus Waters Treaty—moves Pakistan called an “act of war.” The conflict intensified with India's missile attracks and drone incursions as it lauched its Operation Sindoor.

Pakistan's military launched Operation Bunyanum Marsoos in retaliation, and downed five Indian jets—including Rafales—and intercepted 77 Israeli-made Harop drones. Following diplomatic intervention led by Washington, both sides agreed to halt military activity across land, air, and sea.","Listen to articleIn a tit-for-tat move, soon after India declared Pakistani diplomat persona non grata and ordered to leave country.

On 17 July 2014, Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was brought down over eastern Ukraine. The flight was on its way from Amsterdam (Netherlands) to Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia). 283 passengers and 15 crew members were on board, and all of them died in the crash.

Representatives from the Netherlands, Australia, Belgium, and Ukraine created a Joint investigation team to investigate this airplane crash. Russia rejected its connection to the crime.

In November 2022, The Hague Court announced the verdict for the case of MH17. Two Russian citizens, Igor Girkin and Sergei Dubinsky, and Ukrainian citizen Leonid Kharchenko, were found guilty. The court sentenced them to life imprisonment and approved the payment of compensation.

Also, The Hague Court recognized that Russia has controlled the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic since at least May 2014.

The Netherlands and Australia initiated the dispute in March 2022. They asked the ICAO to assign Russia responsibility and start negotiations between three countries under the organization’s control. Moscow announced its unilateral suspension of participation in the dispute in the summer of 2024.

On May 12, 2025, ICAO voted on the decision, with a “significant majority” of the Council members supporting the Netherlands and Australia’s position. The next step is to indicate the amount of compensation that’ll be asked from Russia.

“This decision also sends a clear message to the international community: states cannot violate international law with impunity,” said Foreign Minister of the Netherlands Caspar Veldkamp.

On May 9, Ukrainian officials, the Council of Europe, and foreign ministers from European countries signed a document about political support of creating a Special tribunal for Russian aggression against Ukraine.

The U.S. will remove all sanctions on Syria, President Donald Trump announced Tuesday. ""I will be ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria in order to give them a chance at greatness,"" Trump told a packed auditorium at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, during the first appearance of his four-day visit to the Middle East ""In Syria, which has seen so much misery and death, there is a new government that will hopefully succeed in stabilizing the country and keeping peace. That's what we want to see,"" he said in a wide-ranging speech that focused on his own time in office and U.S. relations with the Middle East.

""In Syria, they've had their share of travesty, war, killing many years. That's why my administration has already taken the first steps toward restoring normal relations between the United States and Syria for the first time in more than a decade,"" Trump said. Syria has been designated a state sponsor of terrorism by the U.S. government since 1979. Additional U.S. sanctions were imposed on the country in 2004 and again in 2011, after the regime of then-President Bashar Assad launched a brutal crackdown on anti-government uprisings. In the roughly 14 years since, the country has been devastated by civil war, sectarian violence and brutal terrorists attacks, including the Islamic State takeover of parts of the country in 2014 and subsequent Western-led bombing campaign to eradicate the extremist group.

The toppling of the Assad regime during a shock offensive by anti-Assad militia groups in December of 2024 stunned the global community, and brought about the prospect of a new beginning for the devastated country. Syria's new president, Ahmed al-Sharaa — a former al-Qaeda member who describes himself as reformed — currently leads the country's transitional government. Syria remained under myriad international sanctions but those imposed by the U.S. were the most severe, as they applied to third parties as well, deterring other countries and groups from transacting with the country. The United Nations and aid organizations like the International Committee for the Red Cross, as well as the Arab League and other NGOs, pushed for sanctions relief following the devastating 2023 earthquake that hit Syria and neighboring Turkey. In addition to throttling the potential for economic progress, the sanctions hindered the ability of aid agencies and governments to provide rapid humanitarian assistance, those organizations said.

The Trump family’s business ties to the Middle East have more than tripled since the president’s first term in office, a CNN tally of the deals has found, including a slew of new projects announced since he reclaimed the White House.

Amid the ongoing plans for luxury skyscrapers, golf courses and cryptocurrency deals in the region, Donald Trump is traveling to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates this week not only as US president, but also as the patriarch of a family whose business empire continues to expand in that part of the world.

His financial ties to the Middle East have prompted concerns among government ethicists who say it’s difficult to determine whether he’s acting in the best interest of the United States or his pocketbook.

“When the American people elect a president, they expect that person to work for them, not for profit,” said Robert Weissman, co-president of Public Citizen, a consumer rights advocacy group. Such financial links, Weissman and other watchdogs say, create an opportunity for foreign powers to seek to sway United States policy through those lucrative business deals.

But Trump has moved full steam ahead, seemingly embracing the overlap of his personal interests and those of the nation. He’s shown he is comfortable boosting business ventures while in office – and doing so in public view. He set the tone by launching his own meme coin days before taking office, which spiked in value right after Trump offered a private dinner to its top investors last month.

“I’ve always had an instinct for making money,” Trump said in February at a conference hosted by a group launched by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund. During the event, Trump promoted the US as ripe for investment but also touted his personal business achievements.

The Trump projects in the Middle East – many of which have been announced but not yet developed – largely involve licensing agreements with foreign developers that have partnered with the Trump Organization and paid to use the Trump name.

Past presidents have divested their businesses or put them in so-called blind trusts to avoid appearances of self-dealing. Trump has taken a different approach. His assets are in a trust managed by his children, and his son Eric Trump, executive vice president of the Trump Organization, has said the business will be walled off from the office of the presidency to avoid any ethical conflicts.

And while the Trump Organization in January pledged to make no new deals with foreign governments during the president’s second term, a recently announced deal for a Trump-branded golf course in Qatar includes a firm backed by Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund, Qatari Diar.

“Through this collaboration, we look forward to further strengthening Qatar’s position as a preferred destination,” the Qatari government minister who heads that firm said when announcing the venture earlier this month.

Eric Trump said in a press release his organization is “incredibly proud” to expand the Trump brand into Qatar through Qatari Diar, and a separate real estate company, Dar Global. Eric Trump told the New York Times last month Dar Global purchased the land for the golf course from Qatari Diar.

A Trump Organization spokesperson said the company has no affiliation, partnership or engagement with Qatari Diar or Qatar’s government and added that the company’s agreement to brand that project is with Dar Global. “The Trump Organization does not conduct business with any government entity,” spokesperson Kimberly Benza said.

President Trump, who famously said “I want America to win,” has repeatedly sought financial boosts for the US from Gulf nations. His administration boasted about securing a UAE commitment to invest $1.4 trillion in the US over a decade, and Saudi Arabia announced in January plans to expand trade and investment with the US by $600 billion over four years. In March, Trump called for Saudi Arabia to spend $1 trillion in the US.

Still, critics say the actions of Trump and his business in the first few months of his second term demonstrate a willingness to personally cash in on the presidency, and some fear foreign officials have helped him do so to advance their own agendas.

During Friday’s press briefing, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt dismissed a question about whether the president would conduct personal business meetings on his trip.

“It’s frankly ridiculous that anyone in this room would even suggest that President Trump is doing anything for his own benefit,” Leavitt said. “This White House holds ourselves to the highest of ethical standards.”

‘Believing in the Trump brand’

Immediately after a mob of his supporters stormed the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, following his election loss, Trump became a pariah in much of the American business community. Hunkered down at Mar-a-Lago, he was banned from some social media apps. A software company stopped processing payments for his campaign website. Prominent financial firms distanced themselves. Even the hotel bearing Trump’s name in the nation’s capital was virtually empty.

“We live in the age of cancel culture,” Eric Trump said, reacting to those moves shortly after the Capitol riot.

But some business leaders stood by Trump, such as his friends in the Middle East.

“I would welcome the opportunity of expanding our relationship,” Hussain Sajwani, the head of DAMAC Properties, the developer of a Trump golf course in Dubai that opened in 2017, said a week after the January 6 insurrection.

Soon, entities in the region offered new opportunities to the Trump family.

After the PGA canceled its tournament at Trump’s New Jersey golf course, Trump partnered with LIV Golf, a new professional golf circuit backed by Saudi Arabia. The league hosts some of its tournaments at Trump properties, including one in April.

In recent years, Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, widely known as MBS, invested $2 billion in a private equity firm launched by Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner. Kushner and MBS developed a close personal relationship when Kushner served as an adviser to Trump during his first term. Though Kushner said he would not return to the White House, multiple Trump officials and people close to Kushner say he has been informally advising US officials on negotiations with Arab leaders, CNN reported Friday.

In the neighboring nation of Oman, the government’s tourism arm in 2022 partnered on plans to build a Trump-branded resort, along with villas and a golf club, near the capital city of Muscat. Last summer, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. commemorated the launch of the joint venture by dining with Oman’s crown prince near a stage emblazoned with the words, “The Ultimate Power Move.”

While those deals materialized during Trump’s time out of office, his business’s expansion in the region appears to have been supercharged after his electoral win in November.

Dar Global, the real estate firm developing the Oman project as well as other Trump-branded towers announced before the election, has since promoted plans for two additional projects in Saudi Arabia’s Riyadh capital and the golf club in Qatar. Dar Global’s parent company, which is based in Riyadh, has committed to advancing Crown Prince MBS’ ambitious plan to modernize Saudi Arabia’s economy.

“Don’t stop believing in the Trump brand,” Dar Global’s CEO, Ziad El Chaar, said in a speech posted online this month in which he touted one of the projects planned for Dubai.

At that same event, Eric Trump referenced how his organization has done “so many projects” with Dar Global and added, “I’m not going to break any news, but I think there’s a few more to come.” He has separately commended Gulf nations for policies that favor development and reject what he has called “woke cancel culture.”

Just Sunday, President Trump wrote in a Truth Social post that his administration would accept a plane to replace its Air Force One as a “GIFT, FREE OF CHARGE.” Two people familiar with the agreement told CNN the 747-8 was from the Qatari royal family. However, a Qatari official said the plane is technically being gifted from the Qatari Ministry of Defense to the Pentagon, which would retrofit the plane for the president’s use with security features. The plane will be donated to Trump’s presidential library after he leaves office, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. Trump added that the plane will “go directly” to his presidential library after he leaves office. “I wouldn’t be using it,” he said.

Companies in the region have also boosted Trump’s crypto firm, World Liberty Financial. UAE-based DWF Labs announced in April the purchase of $25 million worth of the firm’s tokens. MGX, an Emirati-backed investment firm, agreed to use a cryptocurrency launched by the firm for a $2 billion investment in crypto exchange Binance, according to an announcement from World Liberty co-founder Zach Witkoff, whose father is Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East. The chairman of MGX is the deputy ruler of Abu Dhabi and UAE national security adviser.

That announcement from Witkoff prompted Democratic Sens. Jeffrey Merkley and Elizabeth Warren to press the US Office of Government Ethics to investigate the deal, which they stated could “open our government to a startling degree of foreign influence and the potential for a quid pro quo that could endanger national security,” according to a letter they sent last week.

“These Gulf nations are very actively trying to advance their standing in the world and having the president of the United States both do business in their country and come in an official capacity conveys very significant respectability,” said Noah Bookbinder, president of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. “It may be a win-win for these Gulf countries and for the president and his businesses, but it’s less clear that it’s a win for the American people.”

“This is a very delicate region of the world, where there are really important decisions that need to be made about where to deploy the military, how to engage in peace negotiations, and about economic agreements,” Bookbinder said. “You want the President making decisions based on what’s in the interest of the American people… not based on what’s going to be most helpful to his businesses.”

‘A real risk’

American presidents typically visit one of the country’s closest allies during their first major trip abroad. Since World War II, most presidents have traveled to Mexico, Canada or the United Kingdom, according to the State Department. Not Trump.

In 2017, the newly minted president traveled to Saudi Arabia where he was greeted with a lavish reception. Then, he signed an arms deal with King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud. Though Trump traveled to Italy for the pope’s funeral last month, his first official presidential trip during his second term is again to Saudi Arabia.

The United States and Saudi Arabia have a long history of diplomacy, mainly centered on a shared interest: oil. But Trump’s relationship with Saudi Arabia was particularly close during his first term, and the kingdom, which has faced allegations of human rights abuses, benefitted. When the journalist Jamal Khashoggi – a Saudi dissident and an American resident – was killed and dismembered at a Saudi consulate in Turkey after criticizing the Saudi kingdom, the United States’ Central Intelligence Agency reported that the crown prince was behind the assassination. Trump questioned his own government’s conclusion, instead backing MBS.

“It could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event — maybe he did and maybe he didn’t!” Trump wrote in a statement. The crown prince has denied involvement in Khashoggi’s killing.

Ben Freeman, who directs a foreign policy program at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, noted that geopolitics in the region are extraordinarily complicated and Gulf nations have an array of foreign policy positions that don’t align with those of the US. He said additional deals in the region, depending on the specifics, could create reputational risks for the US and even undermine national security.

“There is seemingly this tit-for-tat where the Saudi regime, especially, makes investments in Trump… and Saudi Arabia is the first destination of his first state trip abroad,” said Freeman. “There’s a real risk that personal interests are trumping the national interest.”

Poland’s government says it is now certain that Russia was behind the fire that last year destroyed Warsaw’s largest shopping centre, Marywilska 44. It also says it has detained some of those responsible.

“We already know for sure that the large fire at Marywilska was the result of arson ordered by the Russian security services,” announced Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Sunday evening, just before today’s first anniversary of the fire.

“The activities were coordinated by a person in Russia,” he added. “Some of the perpetrators are already in custody, the rest have been identified and are being sought. We will catch them all!”

Wiemy już na pewno, że wielki pożar na Marywilskiej był efektem podpalenia na zlecenie rosyjskich służb. Działania koordynowane były przez osobę przebywającą w Rosji. Część sprawców przebywa już w areszcie, reszta została zidentyfikowana i jest poszukiwana. Dopadniemy wszystkich! — Donald Tusk (@donaldtusk) May 11, 2025

Tusk’s announcement was immediately followed by a joint statement from interior minister Tomasz Siemoniak and justice minister Adam Bodnar.

They noted that dozens of prosecutors and police have been investigating the fire over the last year, in cooperation with the authorities in Lithuania, “where some of the [same] perpetrators also carried out sabotage activities”.

“Based on the evidence collected, we know that the fire was the result of arson committed at the request of the Russian security services,” wrote Siemoniak and Bodnar. “We have in-depth knowledge about the course of the arson, as well as the way in which the perpetrators documented it.”

In the early hours of 12 May 2024, a fire broke out at Marywilska 44 that spread quickly and, by the time it had been brought under control a few hours later, had destroyed 90% of the premises. As the centre was closed during the night, no casualties resulted from the fire.

Little more than a week after the fire, Tusk had already declared it was “likely” that Russia was behind it. Earlier this year, he revealed that evidence from Lithuania also pointed to Russia’s involvement.

The fire was part of a series of acts of sabotage in Poland and other countries in the region that the authorities have blamed on Russia, whose intelligence services recruited and hired people living in those countries – often Ukrainian and Belarusian immigrants – to carry out the attacks.

In March this year, Poland charged a Belarusian national, named only as Stepan K. under Polish privacy law, with carrying out a terrorist arson attack in Warsaw on behalf of Russia. They noted that the fire was ignited in a very similar manner to the one at Marywilska, which took place just a month later.

They also revealed that the case against Stepan K. was linked to an investigation into other arson attacks on large stores not only in Poland but elsewhere in central and eastern Europe.

Little more than a week after the fire, Tusk had already declared it was “likely” that Russia was behind it.
A fire engulfed a large shopping centre in Warsaw this morning, destroying its 1,400 commercial units, many of them small, family-run businesses.

Zelensky invited Putin to meet in Turkey on May 15 to launch the first direct negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow since 2022, though the Kremlin has not revealed whether the Russian leader would attend.

""Up until now, we have not received an answer or confirmation that President Putin will be in Turkey. But President Zelensky of Ukraine is ready and will go,"" Yermak said in a keynote discussion at the Copenhagen Democracy Summit, in comments reported by Politico.

Yermak said Ukraine is ""ready to discuss anything,"" but ""only if a ceasefire is achieved.""

""We're ready to discuss any options that are on the table. There are many interesting and very strong options. The strongest guarantee is Ukraine's prepared and trained military force, and our partners exactly understand what we need to prevent such a terrible war from happening again,"" he said.

Yermak added that if Putin does not come to Turkey, it will be ""the last signal"" that Russia ""does not want to end the war and is not ready for any negotiations.""

Ukraine and its European allies have urged an unconditional ceasefire starting on May 12 as the first step toward peace. Russia has ignored this proposal, continuing its attacks on Ukraine.

Asked by the Kyiv Independent whether Zelensky plans to make the trip even if Russia does not support the truce or if Putin declines to attend, a source close to the president said, ""We are ready for all options. But of course, we are separately waiting for a response on the ceasefire.""

The last face-to-face meeting between Putin and Zelensky took place in 2019 in Paris during a Normandy Format summit. Since then, there have been no direct in-person meetings between the two leaders.

It was only the other day that scientists warned that residents of Hawaii could soon be dragged towards their doom due to the shore there sinking by around 25mm per year.

That's just the latest in the many, many potentially disastrous consequences of climate change, which has already contributed towards a significant rise in the Earth's temperature, leading to the ice caps melting and the floods that follow.

While Sir David Attenborough reckons that protecting the sea is the key towards saving the planet, it seems clear that there are a huge amount of problems that need to be solved by Earth's best minds.

Unfortunately, those in charge seem to have a far more blasé attitude towards the potential destruction of our planet, with US President Donald Trump instigating 145 actions to undo rules protecting clean air, water and a liveable climate, all in just his first 100 days back in office.

The UK government are taking a slightly more proactive, if questionable approach, reportedly launching a new £50m project to try and 'dim the sum' recently, in the hope that we can cool down the planet which is rapidly rising in temperature.

And Australia are getting involved too now, although the 'black box' that is reportedly being built in Tasmania is perhaps more a way of recording our own mistakes.

The device will also provide an account of how humanity failed to avoid disaster in the event of a climate apocalypse. Hopefully, some of us will still be around to watch it.

Scientists add: ""Earth's Black Box will record every step we take towards this catastrophe.

""Hundreds of data sets, measurements and interactions relating to the health of our planet will be continuously collected and safely stored for future generations.

They don't exactly sound positive about our chances but they are keen to remind us that we all have a responsibility to reduce our carbon footprint, however, annoying it might be when billionaires take their private jets out for a 10 minute-spin.

The scientists conclude: ""Only one thing is certain, your actions, inactions and interactions are now being recorded.""

The U.S. just blinked.,"Last month, U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports skyrocketed to 145%. Some sectors, like cars, were hit particularly hard. Other sectors, like semiconductors, got exemptions. The numbers changed almost as quickly as the justifications, ranging from reshoring jobs to creating a new economic bloc against China.

This weekend, there was a new whiplash as U.S. negotiators announced that they would scale back tariffs to around 30%. In response, China reduced its tariffs on U.S. goods to 10%. Even though the details of the negotiation are still trickling out, the White House is already trumpeting the “Art of the Deal.”

While the U.S. did avoid a major economic calamity, this is not a deal. The U.S. blinked. Welcome to the tariff ""omnishambles.""

The initial round of negotiations thus has undermined much of the leverage that we have for future rounds.

Far from some diplomatic coup, the U.S. climb down reflects the economic risks of maintaining such high tariffs. Activity at West Coast ports had slowed to levels not seen since the pandemic. News from the ports was mirrored in reports of layoffs and bankruptcies among small businesses. Just as bond markets had forced the administration’s hand in April, when it had imposed extreme tariffs against many allies, cutting off trade flows with China had significantly raised the chance of a recession.

While the de-escalation between the U.S. and China will temper some of the worst fears of decoupling, the American economy is far from out of the woods. Reporting suggests that the negotiations provided no new wins in terms of U.S. access to the Chinese markets. And even the 30% tariff level will stoke inflation, as goods from China now face higher taxes than they did a year ago. Equally important, the Trump administration has included a 90-day review window in which the extreme rates could snap back. If you are a business, how can you make any sensible long-term investments? It is just this type of uncertainty that stokes fears of recession.

But for China, the negotiations have revealed the weakness of America's threats. Given that the U.S. was unable to maintain higher tariffs for more than a month, how credible is the proposed snap-back? In many ways, the bargaining dynamics mirror those between the U.S. government and bond markets a month ago. Repeatedly escalating to extremes and then backing down only further reveal U.S. pressure points. The initial round of negotiations thus has undermined much of the leverage that we have for future rounds.

And it is not only that China has learned something about our pain tolerance. As we lick our wounds and restock empty ports with new Chinese goods, Chinese President Xi Jinping is already meeting with Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva to secure new investments and boost Brazilian exports. The administration’s tariff policy has forced the U.S. to scramble to rebuild individual economic ties. Meanwhile, China is playing a global game, diversifying away from U.S. dependencies and going on diplomatic tours trumpeting itself as a free trader.

This leaves many of our closest allies even more confused. At least one of the purported justifications of the tariffs was to create an anti-China economic bloc, and U.S. officials reportedly have tried to pressure countries into reducing their economic ties with China. All the while, however, the U.S. has eliminated traditional incentives like U.S. development assistance that we use to get others on board. Now the U.S.-China negotiations suggest that even the U.S. is not willing to decouple. If that is the case, why would others be willing to risk it?

This leaves many of our closest allies even more confused.

The Trump administration has unleashed one of the most difficult and challenging economic policies of the post-war period; conducting 90 trade negotiations in 90 days is staggering. Now try doing it as you simultaneously fire thousands of State Department workers with key diplomatic and area expertise.

The word omnishambles — popularized in the British political satire “The Thick of It” -- captures a particular type of policymaking characterized by chaos and mismanagement. We are just in the first episodes, but omnishambles is already the clear theme of this show. And while the U.S. has temporarily paused escalation with China, the risks to our economy and global credibility have already started.","The numbers changed almost as quickly as the justifications, ranging from reshoring jobs to creating a new economic bloc against China.

The dad has reportedly been jailed for 10 years in Saudi Arabia after being stopped by security while preparing to fly back to the UK.

A British father-of-four has reportedly been jailed for 10 years in Saudi Arabia over a deleted tweet from an X account with just 37 followers.

Ahmed al-Doush is understood to have been put in prison following his arrest by Saudi authorities on August 31, 2024, while on a family holiday to the country. The senior business analyst with Bank of America was stopped by security while preparing to fly home to the UK from King Khalid International Airport in Riyadh.

‌



He has now been jailed for 10 years after a state-appointed lawyer told his wife Amaher Nour, that he had been convicted of an offence at a hearing on Monday but that he could not tell her what it was, reports the Mirror.

‌

Amnesty International had said Ahmed was told that charges would be issued against him for using social media to spread fake, untrue and damaging news five months after his arrest, and that he was secondly accused of having a relationship with an individual who threatened national security, reported The Times.

Ahmed's family believe these accusations may relate to a 2018 tweet he made concerning the situation in Sudan, with no mention of Saudi Arabia, which he then deleted.

They also believe that the second accusation is related to his alleged association with a Saudi critic in exile with whom he has no relationship beyond knowing his son. His wife was pregnant at the time of his arrest, before catching a flight back to Manchester Airport, and he therefore missed the birth of his fourth child.

Ms Nour said: ""The authorities asked for his documents and we thought it was just a problem with his visa. He called me from security and told me to fly with the children on to Turkey, our transit stop, and said, 'I’ll be with you shortly'.

‌



“The night times are the hardest for me when I’m alone and it’s quiet. I keep asking myself why, why, why has this happened, and I can’t get to the bottom of it because it’s not rational in any way. He has no political associations.”

Amnesty International says Mr Al-Doush has faced 'multiple violations' to his fair trial rights since his arrest and was subjected to extensive interrogation without a lawyer present and before being informed of the charges against him, reported the Manchester Evening News.

For two months, his family also had no contact with him, nor did they receive information about his condition or the reasons for his detention. His contact with his family and UK-based legal team has continued to be severely restricted.

‌

The case was discussed by the UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy with his Saudi counterpart, Prince Faisal bin Farhan bin Abdullah, though details of their call were not disclosed.

Responding to a letter from human rights group, Reprieve, to Mr Lammy concerning the case, a Foreign Office official wrote on April 2 that “the UK government cannot interfere in another country’s legal processes and must respect their systems, nor can we get British nationals out of jail,” reported The Guardian.

‌



Amnesty International said it was not until November last year that that Mr Al-Doush was able to call his wife and family at one weekly intervals. Sacha Deshmukh, Chief Executive of Amnesty International UK said: “We strongly condemn this sentence and reiterate our urgent call on the Saudi authorities to immediately and unconditionally release Ahmed al-Doush, if he is being held solely for peacefully exercising his human rights.

""He must be allowed to return to his family in the UK without delay. In the meantime, Saudi authorities must uphold his fair trial rights, promptly share his court documents with him and guarantee regular access to both his family and legal counsel.

""We also urge the UK government to take all necessary steps to secure his immediate and unconditional release. The arbitrary detention of another British national abroad cannot be tolerated. Immediate and decisive action is essential.”

Meanwhile, China kept improving its global standing, overtaking the U.S. for the first time and recording mostly positive perceptions in all regions except Europe. Russia, the reputation of which tanked in the wake of President Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, is still (slightly) more unpopular than the U.S. — though its image is also improving.

Trump’s reputation is in line with that of his country. The survey showed he’s less popular worldwide than his Russian and Chinese counterparts, Putin and Xi Jinping.

Trump recorded the worst score among a range of political, cultural and spiritual leaders that includes X owner Elon Musk, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, the late Pope Francis, Taylor Swift and Kim Kardashian.

Israel emerged as the country with the worst global reputation of those included in the poll, especially in the Middle East and South Asia. Israel is unpopular even in European countries that have historically been its allies, such as Germany, signaling growing discomfort with its government’s conduct in Gaza and the West Bank.

“It’s a great gesture,” the 78-year-old businessman told reporters at the White House on Monday, when questioned about potential expectations from the oil-rich Gulf state in exchange for the jet.

“I would never be one to turn down that kind of an offer. I mean, I could be a stupid person (and) say ‘no we don’t want a free, very expensive airplane.'” Qatar’s royal family has offered to donate a luxury 747-8 jumbo jet as Trump awaits the delayed delivery of two new presidential planes from Boeing. This move has sparked significant constitutional and ethical debates, along with security concerns regarding the use of a foreign-donated aircraft for the highly sensitive role of Air Force One.

The U.S. Constitution’s Emoluments Clause prohibits government officials from accepting gifts “from any King, Prince or foreign State.”

Trump responded sharply when asked whether he would use the jet for personal purposes after his presidency.

“You should be embarrassed asking that question,” Trump told a reporter. “They’re giving us a free jet. I could say, no, no, no, don’t give us I want to pay you $1 billion or $400 million, or whatever it is. Or I could say, thank you very much.” Trump stated that the jet would instead be donated to his future presidential library as an exhibit, similar to the display of a former Air Force One jet at Ronald Reagan’s library.

Utmost transparency

Trump and the White House maintain that the Qatari jet would be a gift to the U.S. Department of Defense, thereby circumventing constitutional concerns.

Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt assured that the White House would operate with “utmost transparency.”

“The Qatari government has graciously offered to donate a plane to the Department of Defense. The legal details of that are still being worked out,” Leavitt told Fox News.

“But of course, any donation to this government is always done in full compliance with the law, and we commit ourselves to the utmost transparency, and we will continue to do that.”

When questioned about potential quid pro quo from Qatar, Leavitt replied: “Absolutely not, because they know President Trump and they know he only works with the interests of the American public in mind.” Qatar sought to minimize the controversy, clarifying that the jet would not be a gift.

“The possible transfer of an aircraft for temporary use as Air Force One is currently under consideration between Qatar’s Ministry of Defense and the US Department of Defense,” said Ali Al-Ansari, Qatar’s media attaché to Washington.

Democrats, however, swiftly criticized the plan.

“Any president who accepts this kind of gift, valued at $400 million, from a foreign government creates a clear conflict of interest,” stated four members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The statement, issued by Senators Cory Booker, Brian Schatz, Chris Coons, and Chris Murphy, also asserted that the move “raises serious national security questions, invites foreign influence, and undermines public trust in our government.”

Trump has long expressed dissatisfaction with the current Air Force One jets, two highly customized Boeing 747-200B series aircraft that entered service in 1990 under President George H.W. Bush.

Earlier in the year, Trump indicated that his administration was “looking at alternatives” to Boeing due to delays in the delivery of two new 747-8 aircraft.

Trump also displays a model of the future Air Force One, featuring his chosen red, white, and blue colors, on the coffee table in the Oval Office.

(Soon after taking office, Mr. Trump contended that Ukraine itself was responsible, contributing to the late-February blowup with President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office.)

Much of the conversation in Istanbul will focus on the control of territory that Russia now occupies, and whether Ukraine has to radically reduce its armaments, and whether NATO needs to pull back both troops and arms near Russian borders. Mr. Zelensky has vowed to attend, adding to the potential for a standoff. As Stephen Sestanovich, a Russia expert and longtime diplomat who wrote a book a decade ago entitled “Maximalist,” noted after a recent trip to Ukraine, ever since the Oval Office argument “the Ukrainians have found a way to combine gratitude with inflexibility and make it work for them.”

But in recent times, Mr. Putin, getting with the program, has dropped hints about joint Russian-American energy and mining operations, tempting a deal-hungry president to get something out of a Ukraine agreement, beyond his search for a Nobel Peace Prize. Mr. Witkoff sounded thrilled with that idea in an interview with Tucker Carlson.

Now the Iranians are trying a similar tactic.

After several weeks of conflicting statements about whether Iran could be allowed to continue enriching uranium, which can fuel a nuclear weapon, Mr. Witkoff said last week, in an interview with Breitbart, “we believe they cannot have enrichment, they cannot have centrifuges, they cannot have anything that allows them to build a weapon.”

The demands seemed pretty clear.

But the Iranians contend that Mr. Witkoff took a far more gentle approach in the negotiating room last weekend, and did not rule out allowing some nuclear activity in Iran. Meanwhile the Iranians, according to several Iranian and other officials, have begun floating ideas for nuclear energy joint ventures, perhaps with the United States, perhaps with Saudi Arabia, their regional rival. The key is all sanctions would be lifted and Iran would preserve some of the capabilities that Mr. Witkoff, and in recent days Mr. Trump, has suggested must be mothballed or dismantled.

On Tuesday in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, Mr. Trump said he was offering Iran “a new path and a much better path toward a far better and more hopeful future.” Then he said: “The time is right now for them to choose.""","Mr. Putin clearly senses that Mr. Trump cares little about the sanctity of Ukraine’s borders or even who is responsible for the invasion.

The United States is no longer demanding Saudi Arabia normalise ties with Israel as a condition for progress on civil nuclear cooperation talks, two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters ahead of US President Donald Trump's visit next week.

Dropping the demand that Saudi Arabia establish diplomatic relations with Israel would be a major concession by Washington. Under former President Joe Biden, nuclear talks were an element of a wider US-Saudi deal tied to normalisation and to Riyadh's goal of a defence treaty with Washington.

The Gulf kingdom has repeatedly said it would not recognise Israel without a Palestinian state, frustrating Biden administration attempts to expand the Abraham Accords signed during Trump's first term. Under those accords the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco normalised relations with Israel.

Progress towards Saudi recognition of Israel has been halted by fury across the region over the deadly war in Gaza. The nuclear talks had also stumbled over Washington's non-proliferation concerns. In a possible sign of a new approach, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright said that Saudi Arabia and the United States were on a ""pathway"" to a civil nuclear agreement when he visited the kingdom in April.

""When we have something to announce, you will hear it from the President. Any reports on this are speculative,"" US National Security Council spokesman James Hewitt told Reuters in response to a request for comment.

Saudi Arabia's government media office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Even without the normalisation requirement for civil nuclear talks to progress, and despite unpacking the issue from a wider defence treaty, a deal is not yet in close reach, one of the sources said.

One sticking point is Section 123 of the US Atomic Energy Act that allows cooperation with other countries developing civil nuclear capabilities but specifies nonproliferation criteria including limiting uranium enrichment. Saudi Arabia's energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman has said that the kingdom would seek to enrich uranium and sell the product.

One of the sources said the kingdom was still not willing to sign a so-called 123 agreement, which would prevent enrichment or reprocessing of plutonium made in reactors - two routes that have the potential to culminate in nuclear weapons.

Secretary Wright previously told Reuters a 123 agreement would be a prerequisite to any deal.

However, there are several ways to structure a deal to achieve both countries' objectives, Wright has said.

One solution being discussed is a ""black box"" arrangement where only US personnel would have access to a uranium enrichment facility on Saudi soil, the same source said.

Sell more oil

Riyadh wants to build nuclear generation capacity as it seeks to diversify its economy away from oil. Nuclear power could also help free up more crude barrels for export.

Arms control advocates have previously expressed concern about a Saudi nuclear programme because de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has said the kingdom would seek to quickly develop nuclear weapons should its regional rival Iran do so.

The US and Iran are currently holding talks over Tehran's nuclear programme, which Washington and Western allies say is geared towards producing weapons. Iran insists it is purely for civil purposes.

US Vice President JD Vance on Wednesday described the talks with Iran as ""so far, so good"" and said there was a deal to be made that would reintegrate Iran into the global economy while preventing it from getting a nuclear weapon.

Saudi Arabia and the United States are set to discuss a number of blockbuster economic deals during Trump's visit next week, with the US poised to offer Saudi Arabia an arms package worth well over $100 billion, sources have told Reuters. Trump has said Riyadh should ""round up"" a planned investment package in the US to $1 trillion from an initial $600 billion.

The trip is Trump's second visit abroad, after a short trip to Rome for the pope's funeral, since he returned to office in January. In his first term a lavish trip to Saudi Arabia marked his first overseas stop.

Trump fostered close ties with Gulf states including Saudi Arabia during his first term. The country invested $2 billion in a firm formed by Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and former aide, after Trump left office, and there are plans to build two Trump towers in Jeddah and Riyadh.","US 'no longer demanding' Israel normalisation from Saudi Arabia as part of nuclear talksbut during the Biden administration, the US pushed for Saudi normalisation with Israel as part of a condition for progress on nuclear development talks.

The GVN calls on world governments to address the threat of H5N1 avian influenza by enhancing surveillance, implementing biosecurity measures, and preparing for potential human-to-human transmission.

""Understanding the current landscape of H5N1 infections is critical for effective prevention and response,"" said Sten H. Vermund, MD, PhD, chief medical officer of the GVN and dean of the USF Health College of Public Health at the University of South Florida, USA. ""The virus’ ability to infect both animals and humans, combined with recent genetic changes, underscores the importance of proactive surveillance and rapid response measures.""

The outbreak has affected nearly 1000 dairy cow herds and resulted in more than 70 human cases, including the first confirmed death in the U.S. The U.S. poultry industry is at significant risk, particularly in areas with high-density farming and where personal protective practices may be lacking. The highly pathogenic influenza virus is now circulating in all 50 states and Canada, resulting in the loss or culling of more than 168 million poultry in the U.S. since 2022. While human-to-human transmission is not documented, experts warn that virus mutations and reassortments, or combining two flu viruses, could increase transmissibility.

""Genomic surveillance is pivotal in tracking viral evolution and informing response strategies,” said Marion Koopmans, DVM, PhD, center of excellence director at the GVN and head of the department of viroscience at Erasmus Medical Center, Netherlands. “Continued investment in surveillance at the human-animal interface, and immediate sharing of unusual field observations and sequence data is essential for researchers worldwide to monitor virus dynamics effectively."" Dr. Koopmans is a U.S. and Dutch National Academy of Sciences member. She is highly regarded for her research on emerging infectious diseases and as a scientific advisor to policymakers at national and international levels.

The GVN virologists underscore the need for improved pandemic preparedness, drawing on lessons learned from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and previous outbreaks. They advocate for a multi-faceted approach to pandemic preparedness, which includes:

Enhanced Surveillance: Continuous monitoring of animals, including testing of milk and wastewater and individuals working with infected animals, to track virus evolution that may lead to human-to human transmissibility. The GVN calls for more comprehensive state-wide testing in the U.S. and internationally. Faster Genomic Data Sharing: Accelerating the release of genomic data to track virus evolution and spatial transmission, fostering collaboration among global research networks. Improved Farm Biosecurity: Using personal protective equipment (PPE) and strict farm cleaning protocols to minimize human exposure and prevent virus spread. Preparedness Plans for the Roll-Out of Tests: Advocating for self-administered diagnostic tests for farm workers, supported by healthcare access for frontline medical staff, to enhance early detection. Strengthening Public Health Infrastructure: Increased funding and support for response mechanisms, particularly in high-risk regions, to better manage outbreaks. Investment in Phenotype Prediction from Genetic Data: Invest in predicting the phenotypes of avian influenza viruses from genetic data, as key traits are difficult to predict solely from genomic sequences. Investment in Rapid Vaccine Development: Encouraging the development and rapid deployment of vaccines for humans and animals, focusing on farm workers. Preparedness Plan for the Roll-Out of Vaccines and Therapeutics: Prepositioned clinical studies to rapidly assess the properties of emerging virus strains and potential treatments. Preparedness Plan to Allow for Rapid Clinical Studies: Focus on enabling rapid clinical studies to assess key properties of new pandemic strains, evaluate new vaccines and treatments, and support modeling efforts. International Collaboration: Supporting a coordinated global response to track data, share research, and prepare for emerging viral threats to reduce community vulnerabilities and improve response strategies.

""Initiatives should focus on enhancing biosecurity measures in agricultural settings and educating the public about safe handling of poultry products and potential risks associated with contact with infected animals,"" said Peter Palese, PhD, center of excellence director at the GVN and Horace W. Goldsmith Professor of the department of microbiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Dr. Palese is a world leader in influenza research and a U.S. National Academy of Sciences member.

“Given the growing circulation of H5N1 among mammals, the GVN calls for urgent efforts to understand and interrupt transmission in cattle through herd management and potential vaccination,” said Ab Osterhaus, DVM, PhD, center of excellence director at the GVN and founding director of the Center of Infection Medicine and Zoonosis Research at the University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Germany. “Strengthening surveillance at animal-human interfaces is crucial, as current monitoring efforts are insufficient to guide effective prevention strategies.” Dr. Osterhaus is internationally regarded for his work on animal viruses, SARS, MERS, and H5N1. He is a co-founder of the global One Health Community, and a Dutch and German National Academies of Sciences member.

While some surveillance of H5N1 has been carried out, the GVN highlights the lack of comprehensive testing and monitoring to assess the virus's spread and risks to public health.

“A robust nationwide monitoring system is essential to quickly detect, and quarantine affected animals and implement preventive measures to curb further spread and human infections,” said Elyse Stachler, PhD, member of the GVN and a research scientist at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, USA. “Further, we believe it is crucial to maintain trust and stakeholder buy-in for monitoring programs, particularly from farm workers.”

""We are advocating for community-driven strategies to ensure the successful implementation of vaccines, if necessary,” said Christian Bréchot, MD, PhD, vice chair of the board of directors and president emeritus of the GVN and director of the Microbiomes Institute and senior associate dean for research in global affairs in the USF Health Morsani College of Medicine, USA. “The situation with H5N1 demands heightened vigilance and collaboration across public health sectors. Early detection and robust surveillance are critical to prevent further spread.""

""But the dots tell a story,"" immunologist Gigi Gronvall says about the two prints she framed and hung behind her desk at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.

One image shows the meticulous mapping of a London-based cholera outbreak in 1854 by British physician John Snow, whose work pinpointed the source of the sickness: a contaminated water pump in the Soho district. ""The prevailing theory at the time was that cholera spread through air,"" Gronvall says of Snow's groundbreaking work. ""But by gathering and mapping the data, Snow uncovered what we know to be true today—cholera spreads through contact with sewage and feces.""

Dots delineate a different infectious disease in the other, more complex image. There, arrows point up and down and sideways to pink, black, and blue circles, squares, and triangles, tracking viral and genetic material gathered in January 2020 from animals and stalls at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, China. A data visualization from a paper in the journal Cell (September 2024), the intricate markings reveal the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in the materials tested.

For Gronvall, a national security expert and senior scholar at the Center for Health Security, every study like this contributes to our body of scientific knowledge and reminds us, in this case, of a pandemic that led to the loss of more than 7 million people worldwide and trillions of dollars from the U.S. economy. People associate pandemics with the risks posed to human health, but they affect all aspects of society, she says. ""That's another reason we need to figure out how COVID started and what we can learn from it.""

Although the scientific community lacks consensus on whether COVID-19 originated in the Wuhan market or elsewhere, most scientists agree on another matter: We can expect more pandemics to come, owing to factors like climate change, mass migration, globalization, and human encroachment on wildlife and insect ecosystems. According to the center's director Tom Inglesby, who served in COVID-related advisory roles during the pandemic at the White House and in the Department of Health and Human Services, ""as temperatures change, people are moving around the world more rapidly than ever before … and intruding into ecosystems that used to be made up entirely of animals or insects."" This, in turn, creates opportunities for humans to get infected by new diseases and disease strains.

We can expect more pandemics to come, owing to factors like climate change, mass migration, globalization, and human encroachment on wildlife and insect ecosystems.

Another factor contributing to the likelihood of future pandemics are the concentrations of people living in megacities like Tokyo, Delhi, and Shanghai—to name three on a fast-growing list of cities with more than 10 million inhabitants. ""In some, people live incredibly close together without great sanitation, creating conditions for rapid spread, Inglesby says."" This happened last year, for instance, in the Democratic Republic of Congo's capital city Kinshasa, home to 17 million. There, a new, more contagious strain of a disease typically confined to rural areas, mpox, spread quickly. As a result, mpox now poses a threat not only to Kinshasa and the DRC but also the world, given the international flights going in and out of Kinshasa daily.

Over the past few decades, public health experts have watched infectious diseases spring up and evolve in surprising ways. That's a main reason the Center for Health Security was created in the first place, Inglesby says of the group that started in 1998 and has helped fight anthrax attacks and other bioterrorist threats, plus outbreaks of swine flu (H1N1), yellow fever, the Ebola and Zika viruses, and COVID-19.

Chances are, Inglesby says, experts won't be able to predict the next pandemic. It could be the bird flu ravaging U.S. cattle and poultry farms and infecting humans. It could be Zika or dengue fever, spread by mosquitoes, or another strain of influenza or coronavirus. ""No one really knows,"" he says. ""That's why we need to heed lessons from the past and prepare.""

Today, five years after COVID-19 spread to every continent on Earth, killed millions, and left roughly 400 million people with brain fog, breathing difficulties, and other symptoms of long COVID, Inglesby and others want to share and highlight the lessons learned to better prepare us for the next one that will inevitably occur.

Much of what they learned relates to the months leading up to the pandemic, ""a critical window of opportunity to do everything you can to contain the disease,"" Inglesby says. It involves decisions made at the executive level to combat a fast-spreading new virus, along with the timeline and manner in which officials share information and deploy countermeasures. It also involves the steps taken—or not taken—to contend with misinformation, which Gronvall, who teaches a class on the 1918 influenza virus that killed roughly 50 million, says we can count on transpiring in all pandemics.

""We'll be unpacking COVID for decades to come, with doctoral students and scholars poring over the data,"" Gronvall says. But with other pandemics on the horizon and COVID-19 continuing to mutate and cause lasting complications for people with and without chronic health conditions, experts say our country can't ignore what it learned and put its head in the sand.

Lesson 1: Prepare for the worst

On Jan. 1, 2020, epidemiologist Caitlin Rivers opened her inbox to find an email from the disease outbreak surveillance system ProMED, sent one minute before midnight.

""I have a bad feeling about this,"" the senior scholar at the Center for Health Security thought to herself, unintentionally channeling the famous Star Wars line.

The email reported a cluster of pneumonia-like cases of unknown cause in Wuhan, the sprawling capital city of central China's Hubei province, with a population of 11 million. Government officials in China hadn't yet reported the illnesses, but the low-tech email service ProMED had pieced together the news from active chatter on Weibo, a Chinese microblogging site.

Following ProMED's alert, media outlets worldwide started reporting on the strange sickness that turned out to be the novel coronavirus, COVID-19. But according to a report by the nonprofit research institution Project Information Literature, other stories dominated the U.S. news cycle, such as the Senate's impeachment trial of President Donald Trump and the tragic death of basketball star Kobe Bryant. ""Buried deeper in the news flow were reports of a mysterious flu spreading through China,"" the report reads. ""To the Americans who followed this story, this threat seemed safely distant.""

But faculty at the Center for Health Security saw clear warning signs and took swift action. In a Foreign Affairs article published on Jan. 31, 2020, Inglesby reminded the world of a tenet of public health: preparation is the key to an effective response, or, as Benjamin Franklin put it, ""By failing to prepare, you prepare to fail.""

According to Inglesby, as evidence mounted in January that the novel virus could morph into a pandemic, ""governments [worldwide] needed to act immediately by organizing for the worst-case-scenario and turning on all required systems""—a tall order that involves stockpiling diagnostic tests and protective equipment, readying hospitals and health care workers, preparing schools and teachers, and pooling resources and teams to develop a vaccine, therapeutic drugs like antivirals, and the manufacturing supply chain to produce and distribute these products in record time.

""If, for some miraculous reason, a pandemic didn't occur, then the extra work would leave us better prepared for the next one,"" Inglesby says.

Did the right people listen?

Some pockets of the federal government ""were quietly, extremely concerned and doing what they could to prepare,"" Inglesby says. But the government's main effort involved regulating travel from China, with passengers facing health screenings and potential quarantines.

More travel restrictions and bans followed, measures that experts say did little to prevent the spread of a virus already widely circulating. According to Inglesby, ""there should never have been an assumption that shutting down travel was a foolproof strategy. People were moving around the world all the time, and it was too late.""

George W. Bush ""A pandemic is a lot like a forest fire. If caught early it might be extinguished with limited damage. If allowed to smolder, undetected, it can grow to an inferno that can spread quickly beyond our ability to control it.""

In February 2020, as COVID cases multiplied, Inglesby attended a federal government meeting with health care system leaders. ""People were worried, but the meeting was more like a brainstorming session, instead of [an action plan] to start implementing specific steps to prepare hospitals and health care workers,"" he says.

Why no plan?

Pandemic preparedness had been a federal priority since 2005, when President George W. Bush devoted $7 billion to the cause. ""A pandemic is a lot like a forest fire,"" Bush told scientists at the National Institutes of Health. ""If caught early it might be extinguished with limited damage. If allowed to smolder, undetected, it can grow to an inferno that can spread quickly beyond our ability to control it.""

The Obama administration continued the work, taking an aggressive approach to the Ebola epidemic in 2014 and establishing a global health security directorate (through the White House's National Security Council), with a mission to prepare for and, if possible, prevent the next outbreak from turning into an epidemic or pandemic. The directorate [created a 69-page playbook, delineating how to guide government sectors through the complex work of fighting health threats.

In 2018, however, the Trump administration dismantled the directorate, claiming it was overstaffed and needed streamlining. Some staff members merged with other groups, while others left their positions, resulting in what the directorate's former leader Beth Cameron described as a diminished federal workforce devoted to monitoring and mitigating disease spread when COVID broke out.

""In a health security crisis, speed is essential,"" Cameron wrote in a March 13, 2020, op-ed for The Washington Post. ""When this new coronavirus emerged, there was no clear White House-led structure to oversee our response, and we lost valuable time.""

For a country as large as the U.S., creating a unit to oversee and coordinate global health security, with backing from senior government officials, is essential, experts say.

Inglesby agrees. Fighting a disease, he explains, ""involves tremendous coordination among not only government sectors but also private companies, nonprofits, and countries and organizations worldwide. It requires a structured, strategic approach.""

Lesson 2: Deliver information, not reassurance

Sometimes it makes sense to withhold information or quell fear with words of reassurance. When a friend suffers a loss, one might say, You'll get through it. Everything will be OK.

When it comes to a health threat, however, placating the public isn't the right strategy, experts say, and it's a lesson Inglesby and Rivers hope the country will take from the pandemic.

When it comes to a health threat, placating the public isn't the right strategy.

""The job of public health and political leaders should never be to overly reassure,"" Inglesby says. ""The job is to be factual and to provide maximum information to people and their families so they can make good judgments and lower their own risk of spread.""

But as Rivers explains in her recently released book, Crisis Averted: The Hidden Science of Fighting Outbreaks, senior officials downplayed the threat in the weeks before and after COVID became a pandemic. Alex Azar, the secretary of Health and Human Services at the time, announced at press briefings in late February that the risk to the American public remained low, while President Trump tweeted that the health threat had been ""inflamed ... far beyond what the facts would warrant.""

For Rivers and others monitoring the situation, ""the risk to the United States was anything but low … [yet went] unnoticed by most of the public and [was] actively denied by elected leaders,"" she says. That's why, when the U.S. declared a national emergency on March 13, the country was caught off guard.

Rivers, in Crisis Averted, stresses the importance of sharing information in a straightforward, timely manner. ""Clarity is a core tenet of public health messaging,"" she writes. Delivering bad news is difficult, and even the best health officials sometimes use ""opaque language"" and ""fuzzy jargon"" to soften the blow. The problem with these approaches, however, is that they don't ""give the listener any sense of the magnitude of the problem, or any direction about how concerned to be,"" she says.

Instead, people can more easily grasp information delivered in plain language with concrete examples, Rivers continues. This is a goal of public health messaging, but it mostly went unmet early in the pandemic.

As Inglesby explains it, ""the more we're in the mode of dismissing or downplaying the [situation] or of reassuring people, the more anxious they're going to get,"" and the more susceptible they'll be to misinformation.

Instead, people need specific information and evidence-based advice about their own circumstances. ""Some of us face higher risks than others, whether we're elderly or have an underlying condition, or we have a grandmother living with us,"" he continues. ""Everyone needs practical guidance.""

Lesson 3: Admit the unknown

""Science is slow,"" says Gigi Gronvall, sitting at her desk one morning in front of the images that remind her of the knowledge and benefits a society can reap when scientific breakthroughs occur. ""But science is far more effective than jumping to conclusions.""

During the pandemic, with schools and businesses closed and loved ones getting sick and dying, ""no one wanted to wait for information or be told what they could and couldn't do,"" she says. ""No one liked the disciplinarian,"" and public health became an easy target.

According to a study by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, 57% of leaders of local health departments surveyed nationwide became targets of harassment between March 2020 and January 2021, with droves of practitioners opting to leave their positions. ""Constrained by poor infrastructure, politics, and the backlash of the public they aimed to protect, public health officials described grappling with personal and professional disillusionment, torn between what they felt they should do and their limited ability to pursue it,"" the study reports. ""For some, the conflict was untenable.""

Why did public health become the scapegoat of a nation on lockdown?

From Inglesby's perspective, the backlash stemmed partly from an over-reliance on the CDC to make decisions beyond the scope of its expertise. ""The CDC is full of talented scientists, but as a health research agency, it wasn't set up to respond 24/7 to questions from the government and policymakers about matters of logistics and economic and societal tradeoffs, such as whether to close schools and businesses and cancel events,"" he says. ""These are political and civil-society decisions that require a collaborative effort, with people representing various interests weighing in to determine the best course of action.""

Founded in 1946 to stop the spread of malaria, the CDC serves as the nation's leading public health agency, responsible for providing scientific guidance on the spread of infectious diseases. The Atlanta-based agency is staffed with epidemiologists, virologists, and other experts in disease control and prevention, not in areas like economic growth and K-12 education. When asked, in the summer of 2020, to provide guidance on the return to school for students and teachers, the CDC submitted a report to the Trump administration indicating that the move would pose risks to a country experiencing 40,000 to 100,000 new cases of COVID every day—and to a nation with an already-overwhelmed health system.

The administration pushed back on the report, and many blamed the CDC for keeping kids out of school. According to Inglesby, however, the CDC was simply doing what it was set up to do: offering guidance on the matter, as it relates to curtailing harm done by the virus. ""It became all too easy to blame [the agency] for a decision that needed experts in additional areas to weigh in,"" he says.

The backlash on public health also stemmed from the learning curve involved in combatting a wily new virus behaving in unpredictable ways, experts say. ""We didn't have all of the answers, and new scientific evidence was emerging all the time,"" Inglesby explains. ""A study would be completed or half-completed. A new variant would be identified, and the message to the public would change.""

One example: face masks.

Early in the pandemic, scarce information existed on whether masks could stave off COVID-19, so officials didn't suggest wearing them. That changed, however, as data revealed that masks slow down the disease transmission, leading the CDC to alter its guidance. ""Some political leaders and members of the public accused the CDC of reversing positions and [lacking competence],"" Inglesby says, referring to the allegations of ""flip-flopping"" that resounded nationwide. ""What was missing from the conversation, however, is that changes are inevitable in an agency devoted to scientific research—that's the nature of what researchers do."" They gather evidence and conduct studies, shifting recommendations as they narrow in on the truth.

How public health officials present information makes a difference, experts suggest. ""The public doesn't want to hear heavily scientific explanations, just as they don't want to be told everything will be OK, without any specifics,"" Inglesby says.

Gronvall recommends an approach comparable to a police chief speaking at a press briefing. ""The key is to strike a cadence that reinforces a message along the lines of, 'This is what we know right now, and it's why we recommend X precaution. When we learn more and if the guidance changes, we'll update you right away.'""

This way, the message comes across not as a command from all-knowing experts but as an open sharing of evidence-based information for people to use—or not use—to make decisions. The choice stays with the individual, who becomes an informed partner in protecting their health and that of their loved ones.

Lesson 4: Get ahead of misinformation

Tara Sell, a senior scholar at the Center for Health Security, specializes in misinformation—and its ability to turn people away from life-saving health advice. During the pandemic, she mined social media and networking forums for misleading posts about everything from face masks and social distancing to vaccines and anti-viral treatments.

""Misinformation eroded millions of people's trust in public health,"" Sell says. ""It will take a lot of work to rebuild it.""

From her research, she discovered that misinformation stemmed in part from partisan politics. ""Whether to wear a mask, whether to get a vaccine—those choices became tied to people's political identity, which wasn't good for the public and brought consequences that continue today,"" Sell says. Since the pandemic, for example, at least 30 states have passed laws to limit public health authority, and health officials in many of those states can no longer issue mask mandates or close schools.

Tara Sell Senior scholar, Center for Health Security ""Whether to wear a mask, whether to get a vaccine—those choices became tied to people's political identity, which wasn't good for the public and brought consequences that continue today.""

Gronvall says that partisan media outlets fueled misinformation by giving airtime to anchors who contradicted health guidance and sowed doubt among viewers. On Tucker Carlson Tonight, for instance, Carlson spoke out repeatedly against vaccines, going so far as to compare President Biden's vaccination plan to the lethal and torturous medical procedures imposed by the Nazis during the Holocaust. In 2021, he referred to the vaccine as ""the greatest scandal in my lifetime, by far,"" and openly discouraged his roughly 3 million viewers from getting vaccinated.

The media's influence on health compliance during the pandemic hasn't been thoroughly studied, Gronvall says, and she worries the breeding ground for misinformation still plagues us. ""As a society, we haven't addressed the financial forces that went into dismantling public health messages and dissuading people from protecting their own interests,"" she says.

Sell agrees, adding: ""Misinformation is a predictable part of health emergencies, so much so that we'll know what to look for the next time around.""

From her research, Sell noticed striking similarities among misinformation spread during COVID and other crises. For example, tales of infertility nearly always crop up, with reports of, say, a vaccine preventing women from conceiving or delivering a healthy baby. False claims abound about health treatments that use children as guinea pigs, along with conspiracy theories about a government's ill intentions or a pharmaceutical or tech company's financial greed.

Society's most susceptible members often fall prey to the messages. ""Pregnancy and early motherhood, for instance, are vulnerable times for women,"" Sell says. ""You've got a lot of things you don't know, and so you search the internet for information and find a lively audience talking about things that speak to your situation. You get hooked.""

To share what she learned, Sell and her colleagues worked with the CDC to produce a playbook for directors of local health departments to use to identify and address misinformation. The playbook includes instruction on things like how to address rumors, frame messages, and connect with communities to build trust and partnerships.

""As health scholars, we tend to look at situations through the lens of case numbers and infection rates, but other people's values also matter,"" she says. ""We need to step out of our bubbles. We need to listen with empathy.""

The next one

During the 1918 influenza pandemic, as the deadly disease ravaged one battalion after another on the battlefields of World War I, governments went to great lengths to hide the circumstances, fearing the news would lower morale and lead enemy forces to take advantage of the depleted troops.

In the U.S., President Woodrow Wilson signed into law the Espionage Act of 1917, preventing anyone from documenting or discussing anything that would disadvantage the country's military position. The following year, Wilson passed the Sedition Act, a more stringent measure that made it illegal—and punishable by a 20-year imprisonment—for anyone to write, publish, or utter a word that might hinder the U.S. war effort. This, of course, meant keeping quiet about the strange illness killing millions on U.S. soil and across the Atlantic.

Perhaps not surprisingly, Wilson's suppression of free speech fostered a breeding ground for misinformation about a virus that became known, incorrectly, as the ""Spanish flu."" A neutral country in World War I, Spain was among the only countries reporting deaths and illnesses caused by the virus. Word spread that the virus originated there.

Studies reveal that ""the 'Spanish flu' most likely started at a military camp in Kansas,"" says Gronvall, who teaches a class on the 1918 pandemic at the Bloomberg School of Public Health.

Gronvall says her students chime in regularly with stories about COVID—and similarities between the pandemic they experienced firsthand and the one they're learning about in class. She talks to students about rising threats like H5N1, a matter that weighs heavily on those at the Center for Health Security.

At the time of this writing, H5N1, a strain of influenza spread by wild birds and highly contagious and lethal in poultry, continues to wreak havoc on the U.S. poultry and cattle industries, having infected commercial and backyard poultry flocks in all 50 states and cattle herds in at least 16, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the CDC. Seventy humans have tested positive, including veterinarians and others with no known contact with infected cows or birds, ""which suggests we're missing cases,"" Gronvall says. Mammals are also contracting the disease, with H5N1 showing up in red foxes, racoons, bobcats, and even domestic cats, among other animals.

""I'm chronically worried,"" Inglesby says about H5N1. ""There's no evidence right now that it can spread from human to human but that could change in ways that allow it to transmit efficiently between people.""

If that happens, the outcome could be disastrous. ""The lethality of H5N1 infection in a new epidemic would depend on the exact strain, but in the past, there was very high lethality in humans infected with this virus,"" Inglesby explains.

Experts say that the U.S. needs to prepare not only for H5N1 but also for the slew of other infectious diseases with epidemic or pandemic potential. ""We live in an age of pandemics and have to count on an increase in infectious disease outbreaks,"" Inglesby says. ""We have to create [the infrastructure] to develop medicines and vaccines rapidly and surveillance systems that can make quick diagnoses.""

No such pandemic response system exists right now, and it can't happen by the hands of a single country—it requires a global effort, Inglesby indicates.

Since the bird flu broke out in the U.S. in 2022, world experts have been watching what many considered a lackluster response by the Biden administration to contain the disease. Diagnostic testing for H5N1 is in short supply, and in many states, testing cattle isn't mandatory. Infected but asymptomatic cattle can go unnoticed, and farmers who fear economic or other repercussions (roughly half of U.S. farmworkers are undocumented immigrants) may be reluctant to report sick cattle and unable to seek medical care if they fall ill themselves, owing to a lack of health insurance.

""The country needs to remove barriers that get in the way of farmers reporting illness or seeking help,"" Inglesby says. In 2024, the U.S. Department of Agriculture ""implemented a financial incentive for farmers who report illnesses. That's a step in the right direction.""

Still, the number of cattle and humans with H5N1 probably far surpasses the number of cases reported, Inglesby suspects. And the coordination it will take to combat a virus that affects both humans and animals is ""much more complicated than fighting COVID because of the collaboration it takes between the USDA and CDC,"" he says.

A vaccine for the strain of H5N1 running rampant across the U.S. doesn't yet exist, though pharmaceutical companies such as Moderna and Pfizer are working on it. Roughly five million doses of an older vaccine that targets other bird flu strains exist, but those haven't been made available to farmers, who face the most risk.

""Did we learn nothing from COVID?"" Gronvall wonders.

Right now, efforts are underway to restructure, shrink, and limit the powers of the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, the CDC, and practically all government agencies, with budget freezes halting medical research and public health initiatives. ""This is incredibly worrisome for several reasons,"" Inglesby says, ""including what it's doing to public health budgets at the state level, which rely on money from the CDC.""

Gronvall says the abrupt slashes to research and public health budgets, combined with cuts to services that advance and protect human health, are arriving as our country and world face an unprecedented health threat, with more to come.

""We don't know enough about H5N1 or other viruses with epidemic or pandemic potential, and we need to learn,"" she says, gesturing to the pair of images on the wall behind her, the two emblems of acumen gained through data collected and analyzed. ""The only way is through research.""

Emily Gaines Buchler is a senior writer at Johns Hopkins University.","""In some, people live incredibly close together without great sanitation, creating conditions for rapid spread, Inglesby says.""
Over the past few decades, public health experts have watched infectious diseases spring up and evolve in surprising ways.
""No one liked the disciplinarian,"" and public health became an easy target.
Why did public health become the scapegoat of a nation on lockdown?
""As a society, we haven't addressed the financial forces that went into dismantling public health messages and dissuading people from protecting their own interests,"" she says.","['virus', 'information', 'pandemic', 'public', 'inglesby', 'experts', 'spread', 'ready', 'cdc', 'disease', 'health']",China,Kansas,Tokyo,United States,Pandemic Preparedness and Emerging Infectious Disease Threats,negative,"The article discusses the aftermath and lessons of the COVID-19 pandemic, ongoing threats from diseases like H5N1 bird flu, failures in preparedness, misinformation, and funding cuts to public health infrastructure.

2024-01-11 00:00:00,2024-01-11 00:00:00 +08,https://sph.cuny.edu/life-at-sph/news/2024/01/11/universal-coronavirus-vaccine-could-save-billions-of-dollars/,A universal coronavirus vaccine could save billions of dollars if ready before next pandemic,"A new study suggests once developed, having a universal vaccine in advance of the next coronavirus epidemic/pandemic can save up to 7 million hospitalizations and 2 million deaths even when it is the only intervention being implemented and its efficacy is as low as 10%.

What if scientists had developed a universal coronavirus vaccine in the years prior to 2020 so that it was available at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic? A universal coronavirus vaccine targets parts of the virus that are common to either many or all coronaviruses, thereby offering some degree of protection against a range of strains. A new study suggests if such a vaccine were available at the start of the pandemic, it could have saved millions of lives, prevented suffering, and saved billions of dollars in direct medical and other costs until the strain-specific (i.e., SARS-CoV-2) vaccine went through the entire development, testing, and emergency use authorization process that lasted 10 months.

In the study, researchers from the Public Health Informatics, Computational and Operations Research (PHICOR) group, the CUNY Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy (CUNY SPH), and the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) show that having a universal vaccine at the start of the pandemic would have had substantial health and economic benefits under almost all scenarios tested. The study was published Jan. 11 in the Lancet’s eClinicalMedicine.

In order to determine the value of investing in developing and stockpiling a universal coronavirus vaccine, the team developed a computational model that simulated the entire U.S. population, the introduction and spread of a novel coronavirus like SARS-CoV-2 in 2020 and the resulting health (e.g., infections, hospitalizations) and economic (e.g., direct medical costs, productivity losses) outcomes. The experiments simulated what would happen if a universal coronavirus vaccine was available at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Vaccinating with a universal coronavirus vaccine as a standalone intervention (e.g., no face mask use or social distancing) was cost-saving even when its efficacy was as low as 10% and only 10% of the U.S. population received the vaccine. For example, when a universal coronavirus vaccine has 10% efficacy, vaccinating a quarter of the U.S. population within two months of the start of the pandemic averts an average of 14.6 million infections and saves over $27 billion in direct medical costs. Such low vaccine coverage at the start of the pandemic could occur if a vaccine were only made available to certain high-risk subpopulations (e.g., 65 years and older, those with weakened immune systems, frontline workers), similar to the approach when mRNA vaccines became available in December 2020.

“COVID-19 was the third major and serious coronavirus epidemic or pandemic following SARS in 2002 and MERS in 2012, thus, we should anticipate a fourth coronavirus outbreak within the next decade or so,” says Peter J. Hotez, MD, PhD, dean of Baylor’s National School of Tropical Medicine and co-director of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development. “A universal vaccine is cost-effective and cost-saving and a priority for advancement.”

A universal coronavirus vaccine was also shown to be highly cost-effective even if a more specific and more efficacious vaccine came to market. For example, the study shows if it takes four months or longer for a strain-specific vaccine to reach the market, using a universal vaccine was still cost cost-saving. In a scenario where a strain-specific vaccine has 90% efficacy but is unavailable for two months after the start of the pandemic, the results from the model show that vaccinating only 10% of the population with a universal vaccine that has 10% efficacy at the start of the pandemic can save over $2 billion in societal costs (e.g., direct medical costs and productivity losses from absenteeism). Given the time required to develop a strain-specific vaccine during a pandemic to match circulating strains of the virus, this highlights the importance of having a universal vaccine readily available as a stopgap.

“Our study shows the importance of giving as many people as possible in a population at least some degree of immune protection as soon as possible,” explains Bruce Y. Lee, MD, MBA, executive director of PHICOR and professor at CUNY SPH. “Having a universal vaccine developed, stockpiled, and ready to go in the event of a pandemic could be a game-changer even if a more specific vaccine could be developed three to four months later.”

Generally, results from the model found that a universal vaccine would end up saving money if the cost to get a person vaccinated (e.g., cost of the vaccine itself, distribution, administration, storage, research, and development) is as high as $10,390 from a societal perspective.

The US Defense Department’s intelligence agency believed the virus could have been engineered in a lab in Wuhan, China - and caused the pandemic that has killed seven million people so far.

Scientists at the Defense Intelligence Agency concluded the Wuhan Institute of Virology was highly skilled at genetic manipulation, according to analysis obtained by US Right to Know.

And they said the unique make-up of Covid was ""consistent with the hypothesis"" that it was ""a lab-engineered virus"" that ""escaped"".

The 46-page presentation - dated June 25, 2020 and marked ""secret"" - concluded that the virus could have come from ""a large bank"" of bat coronaviruses at the US-funded Wuhan lab.

For years, Shi Zhengli - the lead scientist at the Wuhan lab dubbed ""Batwoman"" - manipulated viruses to make them more infectious in humans, experts claim.

Her lab has been at the centre of the storm since Covid emerged just miles from the facility.

Just weeks before Covid emerged, their ""bank"" of more than 20,000 viruses was mysteriously taken offline.

Many believe it could hold key clues about the origins.

So far, the CIA, FBI and the US Department of Energy have all backed a lab leak as the most likely explanation - with many pointing the finger at the Wuhan lab.

The Sun also revealed how military chiefs were repeatedly told that Covid was a lab leak at the start of the pandemic.

But the new document from the Defense Intelligence Agency is the most detailed analysis released to the public so far that explains the evidence behind the theory.

James Phillips, former Special Adviser to the Prime Minister between April 2020 and September 2022, said: ""This is precisely the conclusion our team came to at the time, but in direct contradiction to the position the UK science establishment strongly took.""

Biosafety expert Dr Richard Ebright claimed: ""All informed parties and persons - without exception - have known for five years.

""This includes those who lied to the public for five years.""

Scientist Steve Massey told US Right to Know that the documents are ""highly significant"".

He said it shows that ""a strong scientific basis supporting a potential lab leak was identified early on"".

The analysis also pointed out that researchers at the Wuhan lab were carrying out experiments at biosafety levels ""which would make an accidental release"" of an infectious bat coronavirus ""more likely"".

They also noted ""Chinese labs have had a history of virus escapes"".

The docs were disclosed through a FOI request for assessments from scientists Robert Greg Cutlip, Jean-Paul Chretien, and John Hardham.

The trio had conducted work for the National Center for Medical Intelligence - which is part of the Defense Intelligence Agency.

The Great Covid Cover-up By Imogen Braddick, Assistant Foreign Editor FEW of us had heard of the Chinese city of Wuhan when the world was first paralysed by Covid-19 five years ago. Today, the sprawling metropolis is synonymous with the ­pandemic that claimed 227,000 lives in the UK — along with its sinister labs where top secret biological experiments are ­carried out. Within the first few days of Britain’s initial lockdown in March 2020, as millions were confined to their homes, questions were already being asked about whether Wuhan’s ­Institute of Virology could be behind the outbreak. Now, as the country marks the five-year anniversary of Covid-19, an exclusive documentary by The Sun reveals the experts, scientists and investigators who not only believe the virus was caused by a lab leak, but that American scientists helped to cover up the scandal. Our documentary took me to the heart of the origins of Covid and explores whether China was trying to cover up the creation of a ­biological weapon by blaming the pandemic on a wet food market 17 miles away. We also reveal that, while scientists publicly insisted the disease came from “natural” sources, behind the scenes they were exchanging messages about a laboratory leak. One expert told us: “Watergate was nothing compared to this. “This is the Chernobyl of biology.” Dr Robert Redfield, the former head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said that a few months before the pandemic, the Wuhan Institute was taken over by the Chinese military while officials deleted its databases and took on a contract for a new ventilation system. We now know that three lab researchers fell ill in November 2019 — a month before the first Covid cases were reported to the World Health Organisation. “I think that’s when the pandemic started,” said Dr Redfield, describing a “frenzied cover-up that was keeping Chinese President Xi Jinping up at night”. The US virologist says he was “aggressively silenced” when he voiced fears Covid had leaked from the lab, where “Batwoman” scientist Shi Zhengli was carrying out experiments on strains of coronavirus.

In August 2023, The Australian reported that scientists from four intel agencies agreed with Chretien and Cutlip’s views.

Yet government officials kept the findings out of the public eye.

It comes after The Sun's documentary The Covid Files: Inside the Wuhan lab-leak scandal lifted the lid on the early days of the pandemic in 2020 that killed millions.

We spoke the experts, scientists and investigators who not only believe the virus was caused by a lab leak - but that American scientists helped to cover up the scandal.

Scientists have repeatedly said that Covid was ""exquisitely matched"", ""completely pre-adapted"" and ""supercharged"" for humans.

And in January, we revealed that Dr Zhengli is still doing ""risky"" virus experiments.

Robert Redfield, the director of America's CDC during the pandemic, said the experiments have ""potentially catastrophic consequences"".

In a paper published in Nature, Shi and a team of scientists boasted they had built the first ""customised"" coronavirus ""receptors"".

In other words, Shi is creating the building blocks to change viruses so that they can infect different species - including humans, Mr Redfield said.

He said: ""Take bird flu - you can modify the receptor so that instead of chickens and turkeys, it can infect humans.

""It's potentially dangerous research. You are taking a non-pathogenic virus and changing it so that it could end up being dangerous to humans.

""You may have a pathogen that is restricted to pigs - but now you could totally change it so that it's highly infectious to other species too.

""She's playing around with bat viruses and modifying their receptor - so now they'll infect cows or chickens, for example. It's ill-advised.

""There's potential catastrophic consequences. It could cause a new pandemic in animals or humans.""

The research will make growing viruses in human cells easier as they have created ""customised"" receptors for viruses.

It means viruses can be more easily adapted to humans, experts said.

Dr Alina Chan, a genetic engineering expert, told The Sun: ""It looks like they have a new suite of engineered host cells to isolate more novel coronaviruses.

""There’s some potential here for risky work to happen downstream.""

Dr Chan, who co-authored Viral on the origins of the pandemic, added: ""In other words, once you have all these novel viruses growing in the lab, what do you do with them?""

Many pieces of the puzzle on the pandemic are yet to be found - and after five years of searching, no natural origin has been discovered.

So far, the CIA, FBI and the US Department of Energy have all backed a lab leak as the most likely explanation - with many pointing the finger at the Wuhan lab.
The Sun also revealed how military chiefs were repeatedly told that Covid was a lab leak at the start of the pandemic.
He said it shows that ""a strong scientific basis supporting a potential lab leak was identified early on"".

The hemorrhagic disease, known for its horrific symptoms like bleeding from the eyes, has already been flagged by health chiefs as a ""priority pathogen"" with pandemic potential.

The victim - a boy, according to The New York Times - had been taken to three different hospitals while unwell.

His three siblings were reportedly ill but have recovered, to child’s father said in documents seen by the paper.

The boy’s mother and her newborn infant died of unknown causes in January, it added.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) confirmed the death on Saturday and has since ramped up efforts in surveillance and contact tracing.

Uganda had hoped the outbreak was under control after eight Ebola patients were discharged in February, but this new death raises concerns.

In total, there are now 10 confirmed cases of the disease in the east African country, including two deaths.

The first known fatality, a 32-year-old nurse, was reported in late January.

He experienced fever-like symptoms, sought care at multiple facilities and consulted a traditional healer before dying.

The Ebola strain responsible for the nurse's death and the outbreak is the Sudan strain, while the strain affecting the child has not yet been confirmed.

It is the most contagious but least deadly variant – although it still kills around 50 per cent of those it infects.

With no approved vaccines for the Sudan strain of Ebola, contact tracing is crucial to prevent more infections.

However, since the most recent outbreak, experts have launched a trial of a jab against the variant.

In early February, the first participant received a dose of the vaccine developed by the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, a global non-profit. Since then, thousands more have been vaccinated.

Local health officials were hopeful after successfully treating contacts of the nurse, but the source of the outbreak is still under investigation.

WHO is helping by screening over 20,000 travellers daily at Uganda’s border points.

4 Ebola has already been flagged by health chiefs as a ""priority pathogen"" with pandemic potential.

Ebola spreads through contact with bodily fluids or contaminated materials.

It is a severe, often fatal illness that can cause symptoms like fever, vomiting blood and diarrhoea, and uncontrolled bleeding from various body parts in the later stages.

Uganda has faced multiple outbreaks of Ebola, including one in 2022 that killed 55 people and a previous one in 2000, that killed hundreds.

This latest outbreak is part of a broader trend of viral hemorrhagic fevers in East Africa, with Tanzania and Rwanda also reporting Marburg outbreaks recently.

What is Ebola? Ebola is a virus transmitted through direct contact with blood and body fluids and objects that have been contaminated by someone with Ebola. It also spreads through contact with sick or dead wild animals. It can take symptoms two to 21 days to appear following infection - this is known as an incubation period. Ebola first manifests as a high fever, intense muscle and joint pain, headaches and a sore throat. Initial symptoms are often followed by vomiting and diarrhoea, rashes on the skin, kidney and liver failure, and sometimes internal and external bleeding. People who survive the virus can suffer from arthritis as well as vision and hearing problems. Some types of Ebola can be prevented with vaccines and treated with medicines. Source: World Health Organisation

Ebola was discovered in 1976 in simultaneous outbreaks in South Sudan and Congo, where it occurred in a village near the Ebola River, after which the disease is named.

The disease is among several other on the WHO's watch list along with dengue and the bubonic plague of pathogens that could trigger the next pandemic.

The list was put together by 200 scientists from more than 50 countries after reviewing a shortlist of 1,600 bacterium and viruses.

Those marked as having 'pandemic potential' were easy to catch and potentially deadly in humans.

Scientists say urban sprawl and deforestation are driving up risky wildlife encounters, while global travel is giving diseases a free pass to spread across the globe.

There is also concern that climate change could be making parts of the world more suitable for disease-spreading critters to thrive.","A FOUR-YEAR-OLD child has died of Ebola in Uganda, marking the second fatality in the ongoing outbreak declared on January 30.

2025-02-13 18:33:16,2025-02-14 02:33:16 +08,https://apnews.com/article/bird-flu-cdc-vets-e468e1dec4c4344c4719f0b23be00540,"Some people didn’t know they had a bird flu infection, study of veterinarians suggests","NEW YORK (AP) — A new study shows that bird flu has silently spread from animals to some veterinarians.

The study published Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention echoes two smaller ones that detected evidence of infection in previously undiagnosed farmworkers. In those studies, several of the infected workers remembered having symptoms of H5N1 bird flu, while none of the veterinarians in the new paper recalled any such symptoms.

The new study is more evidence that the official U.S. tally of confirmed human bird flu infections — 68 in the last year — is likely a significant undercount, said Dr. Gregory Gray, an infectious disease researcher at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston.

“This means that people are being infected, likely due to their occupational exposures, and not developing signs of illness and therefore not seeking medical care,” Gray said. He said it shows that officials cannot fully understand bird flu transmission by only tracking people who go to medical clinics with symptoms.

Study suggests bird flu cases are undercounted

CDC researchers went to an American Association of Bovine Practitioners veterinary conference in September 2024 in Columbus, Ohio. They recruited 150 vets from 46 states to fill out a questionnaire and agree to have their blood drawn. None said they had suffered red eyes or other symptoms associated with bird flu.

Testing found three of the vets, or 2%, had evidence of antibodies to H5N1 infection. All three worked with dairy cattle, as well as other animals. None said they’d worked with a herd that was known to be infected, although one had worked with a flock of infected poultry.

Gray and some colleagues did a study last year of 14 dairy farmworkers and found two, or 14%, had evidence of past infections. Both had experienced symptoms but were never diagnosed.

Another study published last year by the CDC checked 115 dairy workers. The researchers found that eight of them, or 7%, had evidence in their blood of recent infection. Half recalled feeling ill.

The studies were far too small to use as a basis to provide a solid estimate of how many undiagnosed human infections are out there, Gray said. But even just a very small percentage could translate to hundreds or thousands of Americans who were infected while working with animals, he noted.

That’s not necessarily a reason to be alarmed, said Jacqueline Nolting, an Ohio State University researcher who helped CDC with the latest study.

Available studies suggest people who are infected mount antibody responses and may develop natural immunity, which is “good news,” she said.

However, if the virus changes or mutates to start making people very sick, or to start spreading easily from person to person, that would be “a completely different story,” Nolting said.

Experts urge caution around animals

The H5N1 bird flu has been spreading widely among wild birds, poultry, cows and other animals. Its escalating presence in the environment increases the chances people will be exposed, and potentially catch it, officials have said.

Right now the risk to the general public is low, the CDC says. But officials continue to urge people who have contact with sick or dead birds to take precautions, including wearing respiratory and eye protection and gloves when handling poultry.

“No one’s really questioning that the virus has been moving around the country more than has been reported,” said Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory.

He said he expected to see stepped-up information reminding veterinarians across the country to protect themselves with gloves, masks and other equipment to halt infection.

“I know we have deep feelings on these issues, and we may not all agree on everything,” said Mr. Guthrie, a Republican who is in his first term as chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

It was not to be.

Minutes later, a group of protesters in the back of the Capitol Hill hearing room began shouting at lawmakers to “keep your greedy hands off our Medicaid.”

They drowned out the chairman’s calls for order, and Capitol Police officers ultimately removed five people — three in wheelchairs — as the dozens of lawmakers on the panel looked on. (The Capitol Police later said that officers had arrested 26 people for illegally protesting inside a congressional building.)

The disruptions were a raucous kickoff to a meeting that went all evening and was expected to continue well into Wednesday — one committee member estimated it could take as long as 28 hours — as Republicans and Democrats sparred over the plan, a key part of major legislation to enact President Trump’s domestic agenda.

It unfolded as the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee met to consider a $2.5 trillion tax proposal that would extend Mr. Trump’s 2017 tax cuts; temporarily fulfill his campaign pledges not to tax tips or overtime pay; roll back subsidies for clean energy; and create a new type of tax-advantaged investment account for children.

Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee tried unsuccessfully to extend tax credits that have helped people buy insurance on the Obamacare marketplaces. The subsidies are scheduled to expire at the end of the year, and the Congressional Budget Office estimates that more than four million people will lose coverage as a result.

Representative Steven Horsford, Democrat of Nevada, proposed an amendment that would have made the extra funding permanent. He argued that, because Republicans were using an unconventional form of accounting in their effort to make other tax cuts permanent, they should use the same approach to keep insurance premiums affordable.

“You cannot in one breath say it’s OK to provide tax cuts for billionaires and that can be free, and not provide tax relief for working families for health care, for God’s sake,” he said.

A third panel, the House Agriculture Committee, also met Tuesday night and began considering a piece of the bill that would slash nutrition assistance to help raise money for the plan.

But the bulk of the drama on Tuesday was at the Energy and Commerce Committee. During the first hour alone, Republicans giving opening statements were interrupted repeatedly by protesters who accused them of taking health care away from vulnerable people. G.O.P. lawmakers, in turn, accused Democrats of misrepresenting the Medicaid cuts they are proposing to score political points.

Mr. Guthrie labored to keep control over the proceedings, at one point presiding over a shouting match over whether members of his panel were allowed to use the word “lying” in their remarks. (Republicans had been permitted to say that Democrats were lying about the scope of the Medicaid cuts, but Democrats were barred from saying that Mr. Trump was lying about his desire to protect the program. An informal agreement to simply avoid using the word “lie” altogether for the remainder of the session fell apart a few hours later.)

Even some Democratic senators came to take in the spectacle. Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey, Brian Schatz of Hawaii and Tina Smith of Minnesota were on hand.

That was all before lawmakers had debated a single provision of the measure. Eight hours into the hearing, the committee had yet to debate the Medicaid cuts, focusing instead on other changes in environmental and energy policy.

The bill’s proposed reductions in Medicaid coverage and its expansion under the Affordable Care Act have become a flashpoint for Democrats and an area of concern for vulnerable Republicans who are wary of the political consequences of supporting cuts to insurance programs that have become popular with Americans.

Though House Republicans shied away from a huge structural overhaul of Medicaid, their proposal would reduce federal spending by an estimated $912 billion and cause 8.6 million people to become uninsured, according to a partial analysis from the Congressional Budget Office that was circulated by Democrats on the committee. Around $700 billion in cuts would come from changes to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act.

Republicans argued that their proposed cuts would help control rising Medicaid costs by targeting “waste, fraud and abuse” and ensuring the program’s long-term health.

“Medicaid was created to protect health care for Americans who otherwise could not support themselves, but Democrats expanded the program far beyond this core mission,” Mr. Guthrie said.

Their proposal calls for stricter paperwork requirements across the program, makes changes that affect federal funding to states and adds a work requirement to Medicaid that requires poor, childless adults to prove they are working 80 hours every month to stay enrolled.

That provision, which targets an expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, would not kick in until January 2029, after the next presidential election.

During their opening remarks, Democrats on the committee held up matching posters with photographs of constituents they deemed the “faces of Medicaid.” The lawmakers told their stories as a way of humanizing people who rely on the program.

Representative Debbie Dingell of Michigan directly addressed a family who had traveled to Washington in the hearing, who she said needed Medicaid to care for a child with Down syndrome. Representative Marc Veasey of Texas held his phone up to the microphone, inviting a constituent to speak about how Medicaid affected her. Mr. Guthrie ruled that out of order.

Some of the people being highlighted were not at risk of losing coverage under the Republican proposal. And Democrats frequently claimed that the Republican plan would cause 13.7 million Americans to become uninsured, inflating the bill’s effects on coverage by about five million people.

Pointing to these discrepancies, Republican lawmakers accused Democrats of dishonest politicking.

“Not a single person on these posters is going to be affected,” Representative Kat Cammack of Florida said.

“It’s unfortunate that people are so enraged by misinformation,” Representative Gary Palmer, Republican of Alabama, said, referring to a woman who was taken from the room by the police after she shouted that she was H.I.V. positive and that the Medicaid cuts “will kill me.”

As the hearing started, the hallway outside was packed with protesters, many of them wearing shirts or bearing signs that read “Hands Off Medicaid.” Others wore shirts reading “Fight for Planned Parenthood.” The organization is targeted by a provision in the bill that would block Medicaid from funding health providers that also offer abortion services.

“Hopefully, everyone understands that these demonstrations — people feel very strongly,” Representative Frank Pallone Jr., the top Democrat on the committee, said. “Because they know they’re losing their health care.”

The event, billed as the first U.S.-Saudi investment summit, featured top executives in banking, finance and other industries, but the heavy presence of the tech sector reflected how deeply the industry has relied on Gulf States to fulfill its ambitions in artificial intelligence. In recent years tech leaders have made pilgrimages to the Middle East to raise money to develop the AI infrastructure that they have staked their futures on building. The relationship is a two-way street: Saudi Arabia is also looking to diversify its economy away from oil, and the deals and partnerships that have emerged from the trip show how the kingdom is using its deep pockets to become a major player in its own right.

Among the spate of deals announced on the trip was a promise from Nvidia that it will sell hundreds of thousands of its newest “Blackwell” chips to Humain, a startup launched by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund. Chip designer Advanced Micro Devices also announced a $10 billion collaboration with Humain. Amazon announced major AWS data centers in the kingdom earlier this year.

The public presence of so many executives is a far cry from 2018, when members of the business elite went so far as to boycott the kingdom’s investment conference — dubbed Davos in the Desert — over the killing of the Saudi journalist and Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Notably, Amazon founder and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos, who supported a high-profile campaign to draw attention to Khashoggi’s death, did not appear to be in attendance at Tuesday’s event.

Trump’s first major international trip of his second term showcases his emerging model of commercial diplomacy, in which business interests —some of them involving his own family and associates — are intertwined with and even equated to U.S. foreign policy goals. Business leaders and companies are cast in roles as policy ambassadors.

Yet the goals of business leaders and the national interest are sometimes at odds. Foreign policy experts have questioned whether the U.S. is offering up access to core strategic technologies, such as valuable AI semiconductor chips, but getting too little in return —and potentially putting national security at risk by creating profound dependance on autocratic countries. And the question of whether helping big companies get “a lot of checks” benefits the nation appears to have receded to the background amid a cutthroat AI arms race with China.

Trump has often been willing to marshal the authority of his administration to helpAmerican companies get access to big foreign coffers to stay competitive, even as some have warned that such an approach could put the U.S. at risk down the line. The president likes to play the role of convener, the most powerful person in a room of powerful people. This week he certainly did so.

Who wasn’t there?

There were some notable absences among the pantheon of tech billionaires who’ve attended Trump events before.

One in five people in the Gaza Strip are facing starvation as the entire territory edges closer to famine, a new United Nations-backed report warns, after nearly three months of Israel’s blockade of critically needed humanitarian aid.

The warning comes as the UN and several NGOs, as well as civilians in Gaza, say the situation has deteriorated since Israel launched its renewed assault on the enclave in March, as residents struggle to access food, medicine and clean water.

The enclave’s entire population is experiencing “high levels of acute food security” and the territory is at “high risk” of famine, the most severe type of hunger crisis, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) said in its latest report Monday.

“Goods indispensable for people’s survival are either depleted or expected to run out in the coming weeks,” the IPC said. Food is running out, and what little is left is being sold at exorbitant prices that few can afford, it said.

Israel imposed a humanitarian blockade on Gaza on March 2, cutting off food, medical supplies, and other aid to the more than 2 million Palestinians who live in the territory. Israel says the blockade, along with the military’s expansion of its bombardment of Gaza, is intended to pressure Hamas to release hostages held in the enclave – but international organizations say it violates international law, with some accusing Israel of using starvation as a weapon of war.

There is a “high risk” that famine will occur between now and the end of September, the IPC report warned, leaving most people in Gaza without access to food, water, shelter, and medicine.

“Only an immediate and sustained cessation of hostilities and the resumption of humanitarian aid delivery can prevent a descent into famine,” the report said.

Under the IPC system – a five-phase scale used to measure the severity of food insecurity – a famine can only be declared if data shows certain thresholds are met. Those conditions are: at least 20% of all households must face an extreme food shortage, 30% or more of children must be acutely malnourished, and at least 2 in every 10,000 people die every day because of outright starvation or the interaction of malnutrition and disease.

The first threshold has already been met, according to the IPC. Nearly 469,500 people – around 22% of the population - will likely experience “catastrophic” food insecurity, the highest phase on the IPC scale, between May and September, the report said.

David Mencer, a spokesperson for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office, said Monday that “famine has never happened” in Gaza, despite IPC warnings, and that if there is hunger in Gaza, it is caused by Hamas depriving civilians of humanitarian aid.

Whilst largely pinning the blame on Hamas for rising hunger levels, US ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee on Friday acknowledged the rapidly deteriorating situation in Gaza, telling CNN: “If there wasn’t a humanitarian crisis, there wouldn’t be an effort to try to deal with it. So, the answer is, obviously yes, there is a humanitarian crisis.”

Since March, Israel’s renewed assault has displaced more than 430,000 people, the report said, disrupting essential services and the distribution of critical supplies.

All 25 bakeries run by the UN’s World Food Programme (WFP) were forced to shutter at the beginning of April due to lack of supplies, and food is running out at most of the 177 hot meal kitchens, according to the IPC report. And food prices are soaring.

Prices for flour have increased 3,000% since February and 55-pound sack of wheat flour can run anywhere between $235 and $520, the report said.

At a Monday press conference, the UN Secretary General’s spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said only “about 260,000 meals have been prepared and delivered across the Gaza Strip” on Monday, which is a 70% reduction since last Wednesday.

According to the spokesperson, the blockade, which has passed 70 days, has depleted UN agencies’ food reserves. “Stocks have run out, bakeries have shut down, community kitchens are closing daily, and people are starving,” he said.

Pregnant women and children among the most at risk

Children and pregnant women are at particularly high risk. Nearly 71,000 cases of acute malnutrition among children under five are expected between April 2025 and March 2026, the report said. And nearly 17,000 pregnant and breastfeeding women will need treatment for acute malnutrition, it said.

During the nineteen months since Israel launched its assault on Gaza in the wake of the October 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel, people have resorted to scavenging for food, eating grass and animal feed, and drinking polluted water. Starving mothers have been unable to produce enough milk to feed their babies and parents have scrambled to keep their children alive, parents and doctors told CNN.

Imran Rajab, a mother living in Gaza city, told CNN earlier this month she was forced to bake bread using flour from a garbage dumpster to feed her six children.

“My kids are vomiting after they eat it. It smells horrible,” Rajab said. “But what else can I do? What will I feed my children if not this?”

Dr. Amjad Al-Muzaini, a gynecologist working in Gaza City, said women in Gaza are forced to choose between feeding their children or caring for their own health. Most often, they sacrifice their own well-being to ensure survival, he said.

While doing cesarean surgeries, women were found to have severely deteriorated intestinal and uterine tissues, Al-Muzaini said, likely the effects of eating poor-quality and mainly canned foods.

The WFP has said recently it is ready to surge enough aid into Gaza to feed the entire population for up to two months. UNRWA, the main UN agency supporting Palestinians, said it has nearly 3,000 trucks filled with aid waiting to cross into Gaza that is currently blocked by Israel.

“Families in Gaza are starving while the food they need is sitting at the border,” the WFP’s Executive Director, Cindy McCain said on X. “But WFP hasn’t been able to get new aid in since 2 March.”

“If we wait for famine to be officially confirmed, it will be TOO LATE,” she said.

Israel launched its war in Gaza following Hamas’ October 2023 attack in which militants killed 1,200 people and took 251 hostage. Since then, Israel’s military campaign has killed almost 53,000 Palestinians. Since Israel resumed its bombardment in March, more than 2,500 Palestinians have been killed, according to figures provided by the Ministry of Health in Gaza.","CNN —One in five people in the Gaza Strip are facing starvation as the entire territory edges closer to famine, a new United Nations-backed report warns, after nearly three months of Israel’s blockade of critically needed humanitarian aid.

Former Uruguayan President José Mujica, known as ""Pepe"", has died at the age of 89. The ex-guerrilla who governed Uruguay from 2010 to 2015 was known as the world's ""poorest president"" because of his modest lifestyle. Current President Yamandú Orsi announced his predecessor's death on X, writing: ""thank you for everything you gave us and for your deep love for your people."" The politician's cause of death is not known but he had been suffering from oesophageal cancer.

Because of the simple way he lived as president, his criticism of consumerism and the social reforms he promoted - which, among other things, meant Uruguay became the first country to legalise the recreational use of marijuana - Mujica became a well-known political figure in Latin America and beyond. His global popularity is unusual for a president of Uruguay, a country with just 3.4 million inhabitants where his legacy has also generated some controversy. In fact, even though many tended to see Mujica as someone outside the political class, that was not the case. He said his passion for politics, as well as for books and working the land, was passed on to him by his mother, who raised him in a middle-class home in Montevideo, the capital city. As a young man, Mujica was a member of the National Party, one of Uruguay's traditional political forces, which later became the centre-right opposition to his government. In the 1960s, he helped set up the Tupamaros National Liberation Movement (MLN-T), a leftist urban guerrilla group that carried out assaults, kidnappings and executions, although he always maintained that he did not commit any murder. Influenced by the Cuban revolution and international socialism, the MLN-T launched a campaign of clandestine resistance against the Uruguayan government, which at the time was constitutional and democratic, although the left accused it of being increasingly authoritarian. During this period, Mujica was captured four times. On one of those occasions, in 1970, he was shot six times and nearly died.

He escaped from prison twice, on one occasion through a tunnel with 105 other MLN-T prisoners, in one of the largest escapes in Uruguayan prison history. When the Uruguayan military staged a coup in 1973, they included him in a group of ""nine hostages"" who they threatened to kill if the guerrillas continued their attacks. During the more than 14 years he spent in prison during the 1970s and 1980s, he was tortured and spent most of that time in harsh conditions and isolation, until he was freed in 1985 when Uruguay returned to democracy. He used to say that during his time in prison, he experienced madness first hand, suffering from delusions and even talking to ants. The day he was freed was his happiest memory, he says: ""Becoming president was insignificant compared to that.""

From guerrilla to president

A few years after his release, he served as a lawmaker, both in the Chamber of Representatives and in the Senate, the country's lower and upper houses respectively. In 2005, he became minister in the first government of the Frente Amplio, the Uruguayan leftist coalition, before becoming Uruguay's president in 2010. He was 74 years old at the time, and, to the rest of the world, still unknown. His election marked an important moment for the Latin American left, which was already strong on the continent at that time. Mujica became leader alongside other left-wing presidents such as Luis Inácio Lula da Silva in Brazil and Hugo Chávez in Venezuela. However, Mujica governed in his own way, demonstrating pragmatism and audacity on several occasions, political commentators say.

During his administration, amid a fairly favourable international context, the Uruguayan economy grew at an average annual rate of 5.4%, poverty was reduced, and unemployment remained low. Uruguay also drew global attention for the social laws passed by parliament during those years, such as the legalisation of abortion, the recognition of same-sex marriage, and state regulation of the marijuana market. While in office, Mujica rejected moving into the presidential residence (a mansion), as heads of state around the world usually do. Instead, he remained with his wife - politician and former guerrilla Lucía Topolansky - in their modest home on the outskirts of Montevideo, with no domestic help and little security. This combined with the fact that he always dressed casually, that he was often seen driving his light blue 1987 Volkswagen Beetle and gave away a large portion of his salary, led some media outlets to call him ""the world's poorest president"". But Mujica always rejected that title: ""They say I'm the poorest president. No, I'm not,"" he told me in a 2012 interview at his home. ""Poor are those who want more [...] because they're in an endless race."" Despite Mujica preaching austerity, his government did significantly increase public spending, widening the fiscal deficit and leading his opponents to accuse him of waste. Mujica was also criticised for failing to reverse the growing problems in Uruguayan education, despite having promised that education would be a top priority for his administration. However, unlike other leaders in the region, he was never accused of corruption or of undermining his country's democracy. By the end of his administration, Mujica had a high domestic popularity rating (close to 70%) and was elected senator, but also spent part of his time travelling the world after he stepped down as president. ""So what it is that catches the world's attention? That I live with very little, a simple house, that I drive around in an old car? Then this world is crazy because it's surprised by [what is] normal,"" he reflected before leaving office.

“The atmosphere was of great fraternity,” said the Rev. Gabriele Pedicino, head of the Augustinians’ Italian branch. “You really always have to practice and remember that he is now the pope, because he puts you at ease and has this closeness that always impresses me.”

Leo was seen arriving in a black vehicle at around lunchtime at the Augustinianum, the pontifical institute that also serves as the Rome-based residence and headquarters of the Order of St. Augustine. Leo left shortly before 3 p.m.

The ethos of the order, which includes a contemplative spirituality, communal living and service to others, is traced to the fifth-century St. Augustine of Hippo, one of the theological and devotional giants of early Christianity.

The former Rev. Robert Prevost, history’s first American pope, was twice elected superior of the order, serving as general prior from 2001-2013. The order was formed in the 13th century as a community of mendicant friars — dedicated to poverty, service and evangelization and inspired by the saint.

Ever since his May 8 election, Leo has repeatedly emphasized that he’s a “son of St. Augustine” and quoted from the saint.

He visited an Augustinian-run Marian sanctuary south of Rome on Saturday in his first outing as pope, and during his first greeting to the world, Leo wore a pectoral cross given to him by his order that contained relics of St. Augustine.

Leo, the first Augustinian pope, has also kept as his papal coat of arms and motto “In Illo uno unum.” The words were pronounced by St. Augustine in a sermon to explain that “although we Christians are many, in the one Christ we are one.” The emblem on the coast of arms is that of the Augustinian order: a pierced flaming heart and a book, representing the Scriptures.

Pedicino said that he expected Leo to apply Augustine’s teaching about communion and unity in diversity in his new ministry as pope.

“Diversity isn’t a danger or something negative,” he said of Augustine’s teaching. “So I think the pope will work so that inside the church and out, the ‘other’ is increasingly seen not as a danger if different, but as someone to love and who enriches our life and makes it more beautiful.”

MOSCOW and KYIV — Efforts to halt, or perhaps even end, the war in Ukraine hit a new phase this week — when it appears at least someone from Russia and someone else from Ukraine will gather in Turkey for their first direct talks since the early months of the Kremlin's full-scale invasion in 2022.

If that sounds vague it's because it is. At this point, only Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he will be in Turkey on Thursday no matter what, likely with a delegation.

The Russian side could include mid-level diplomats. Or more senior Kremlin envoys. Or President Vladimir Putin.

Adding intrigue: President Trump says he may even make a cameo.

For all the ""great television"" Trump's possible participation could bring, the American leader has also expressed hope that Europe's deadliest war since World War II — what Trump calls a ""bloodbath"" — will finally end.

Unilateral Russian ""ceasefire""

The latest diplomatic maneuvering began in late April when Putin unilaterally announced a three-day ceasefire to mark World War II Victory Day celebrations in Russia last week.

World Russia marks the 80th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany Russia marks the 80th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany Listen · 3:57 3:57

Both Moscow and Kyiv each accused the other of violating a truce Ukraine had never agreed to — even as it prompted Ukraine, with backing from European leaders (France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Poland) and the United States (it seems), to demand an extended 30-day ceasefire from the Kremlin.

Faced with a ceasefire ultimatum or the prospect of massive new Western sanctions on banking and energy, Putin instead made a counter offer.

In a late-night appearance before journalists over the weekend, Putin proposed direct talks between Kyiv and Moscow in Turkey for this Thursday.

Admittedly, Putin still had to clear it with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

""I want to ask [Erdogan] if he would allow for the opportunity to hold talks in Turkey,"" Putin said. ""I hope he'll confirm his desire to sponsor a search for peace in Ukraine.""

Sponsor Message

Was it more of what critics say is Russia's foot-dragging aimed at drawing out negotiations while its forces make gains on the Ukrainian battlefield? There are reasons to think so.

Putin insisted Russia would enter into the talks ""with no preconditions"" even as he insisted he sought a lasting peace that addressed ""the root causes of the conflict.""

In Kremlin speak, that has long meant Ukraine's demilitarization and an end to Kyiv's NATO ambitions, among other demands. Preconditions, by any other name.

But the Russian president said Russia was committed to negotiations — and suggested a new ceasefire as a possible outcome.

""Military operations are ongoing, a war is happening, and we are offering to return to negotiations,"" Putin said, adding that Kyiv, not Moscow, had broken off previous talks.

""What could be bad about this?"" the Kremlin leader added. ""Those who truly want peace cannot not support this.""

Trump pushes leaders to meet in person

Trump responded to Putin's suggestion with enthusiasm.

This is a ""potentially great day for Russia and Ukraine!"" he wrote on social media, demanding that Ukraine attend in a subsequent post.

""At least they will be able to determine whether or not a deal is possible, and if it is not, European leaders, and the US, will know where everything stands, and can proceed accordingly,"" Trump wrote. ""Have the meeting, now!""

Ukrainian President Zelenskyy immediately agreed, though only if Putin signed on to a ceasefire first.

Yet, speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Zelenskyy said he planned to be in Turkey on Thursday regardless and positioned himself as a more reliable partner for peace than Putin. He noted Russia had dismissed a 30-day ceasefire proposal brokered by the U.S. in March and violated even its own ceasefires over Easter and last weekend.

""I believe Putin does not want an end to the war and does not want a ceasefire,"" Zelenskyy said.

He said he had spoken to Erdogan and that he and the Turkish president will be waiting for Putin in Turkey's capital, Ankara. Zelenskyy said the two men will fly to Istanbul if Putin insists on meeting there.

Sponsor Message

""We will do everything to make this meeting happen,"" Zelenskyy said. ""If Putin is truly ready not just in the media but in real life to meet, and then, at the level of leaders, we will do everything to agree on a ceasefire. Because it is with him that I must negotiate a ceasefire. Because he is the only one who decides on it.""

Zelenskyy said Putin started the war and can also end it.

In Moscow, few believed Putin would accept Zelenskyy's challenge. The Kremlin has long pursued a strategy of treating the Ukrainian leader with contempt and less than Putin's equal.

That is until Trump suggested he may show up in Istanbul too.

""I've got so many meetings, but I was thinking about actually flying over there,"" Trump told reporters at the White House Monday. ""Don't underestimate Thursday in Turkey.""

That has raised expectations that Russia's leader could attend.

Amid the apparent new diplomatic opening, the Europeans have placed their sanctions threats on hold.

In turn, theories abound: Had Putin intentionally timed the Istanbul offer with Trump's current trip through the Middle East? Was it by design with Washington or bait to lure the U.S. president? And, most crucially, could Russia and Ukraine agree to a ceasefire or something even more substantial during the talks — in whatever form they take?

In the latest India-Pakistan stand-off, there were no ultimatums, no red buttons. Yet the cycle of military retaliation, veiled signals and swift international mediation quietly evoked the region's most dangerous shadow. The crisis didn't spiral towards nuclear war, but it was a reminder of how quickly tensions here can summon that spectre. Even scientists have modelled how easily things could unravel. A 2019 study by a global team of scientists opened with a nightmare scenario where a terrorist attack on India's parliament in 2025 triggers a nuclear exchange with Pakistan. Six years later, a real-world stand-off - though contained by a US-brokered ceasefire on Saturday - stoked fears of a full-blown conflict. It also revived uneasy memories of how fragile stability in the region can be. As the crisis escalated, Pakistan sent ""dual signals"" - retaliating militarily while announcing a National Command Authority (NCA) meeting, a calculated reminder of its nuclear capability. The NCA oversees control and potential use of the country's nuclear arsenal. Whether this move was symbolic, strategic or a genuine alert, we may never know. It also came just as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio reportedly stepped in to defuse the spiral. President Trump said the US didn't just broker a ceasefire - it averted a ""nuclear conflict"". On Monday, in an address to the nation, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said: ""[There] is no tolerance for nuclear blackmail; India will not be intimidated by nuclear threats. ""Any terrorist safe haven operating under this pretext will face precise and decisive strikes,"" Modi added. India and Pakistan each possess about 170 nuclear weapons, according to the think-tank Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri). As of January 2024, Sipri estimated there were 12,121 nuclear warheads worldwide. Of these, about 9,585 were held in military stockpiles, with 3,904 actively deployed - 60 more than the previous year. The US and Russia together account for more than 8,000 nuclear weapons. The bulk of both India's and Pakistan's deployed arsenals lies in their land-based missile forces, though both are developing nuclear triads capable of delivering warheads by land, air and sea, according to Christopher Clary, a security affairs expert at the University at Albany in the US. ""India likely has a larger air leg (aircraft capable of delivering nuclear weapons) than Pakistan. While we know the least of Pakistan's naval leg, it is reasonable to assess that India's naval leg is more advanced and more capable than Pakistan's sea-based nuclear force,"" he told the BBC. One reason, Mr Clary said, is that Pakistan has invested nowhere near the ""time or money"" that India has in building a nuclear-powered submarine, giving India a ""clear qualitative"" edge in naval nuclear capability. Since testing nuclear weapons in 1998, Pakistan has never formally declared an official nuclear doctrine. India, by contrast, adopted a no-first-use policy following its own 1998 tests. But this stance has shown signs of softening. In 2003, India reserved the right to use nuclear weapons in response to chemical or biological attacks - effectively allowing for first use under certain conditions. Further ambiguity emerged in 2016, when then–defence minister Manohar Parrikar suggested India shouldn't feel ""bound"" by the policy, raising questions about its long-term credibility. (Parrikar clarified that this was his own opinion.)

The absence of a formal doctrine doesn't mean Pakistan lacks one - official statements, interviews and nuclear developments offer clear clues to its operational posture, according to Sadia Tasleem of Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Pakistan's nuclear threshold remains vague, but in 2001, Khalid Kidwai - then head of the Strategic Plans Division of the NCA - outlined four red lines: major territorial loss, destruction of key military assets, economic strangulation or political destabilisation. In 2002, then-president Pervez Musharraf clarified that ""nuclear weapons are aimed solely at India"", and would only be used if ""the very existence of Pakistan as a state"" was at stake. In his memoir, former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wrote that he was jolted awake at night to speak with an unnamed ""Indian counterpart"" who feared Pakistan was preparing to use nuclear weapons during the 2019 stand-off with India. Around the same time, Pakistani media quoted a senior official issuing a stark warning to India: ""I hope you know what the [National Command Authority] means and what it constitutes. I said that we will surprise you. Wait for that surprise… You have chosen a path of war without knowing the consequences for the peace and security of the region."" During the 1999 Kargil War, Pakistan's then-foreign secretary Shamshad Ahmed warned that the country would not ""hesitate to use any weapon"" to defend its territory. Years later, US official Bruce Riedel revealed that intelligence indicated Pakistan was preparing its nuclear arsenal for possible deployment.

But there is scepticism on both sides over such claims. Former Indian high commissioner to Pakistan Ajay Bisaria wrote in his memoir that Pompeo overstated both the risk of nuclear escalation and the US role in calming the conflict in 2019. And during Kargil, Pakistan ""knew the Indian Air Force wouldn't cross into its territory"" - so there was no real trigger for even an implicit nuclear threat, insist Pakistani analysts. ""Strategic signalling reminds the world that any conflict can spiral - and with India and Pakistan, the stakes are higher due to the nuclear overhang. But that doesn't mean either side is actively threatening nuclear use,"" Ejaz Haider, a Lahore-based defence analyst, told the BBC. But nuclear escalation can happen by accident too. ""This could happen by human error, hackers, terrorists, computer failures, bad data from satellites and unstable leaders,"" Prof Alan Robock of Rutgers University, lead author of the landmark 2019 paper by a global team of scientists, told the BBC. In March 2022, India accidentally fired a nuclear-capable cruise missile which travelled 124km (77 miles) into Pakistani territory before crashing, reportedly damaging civilian property. Pakistan said India failed to use the military hotline or issue a public statement for two days. Had this occurred during heightened tensions, the incident could have spiralled into serious conflict, experts say. (Months later, India's government sacked three air force officers for the ""accidental firing of a missile"".) Yet, the danger of nuclear war remains ""relatively small"" between India and Pakistan, according to Mr Clary. ""So long as there is not major ground combat along the border, the dangers of nuclear use remain relatively small and manageable,"" he said. ""In ground combat, the 'use it or lose it' problem is propelled by the possibility that your ground positions will be overrun by the enemy."" ('Use it or lose it' refers to the pressure a nuclear-armed country may feel to launch its weapons before they are destroyed in a first strike by an adversary.)

MELBOURNE, Australia -- The Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization on Tuesday found Russia responsible for shooting down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine with the loss of 298 lives more than a decade ago, in a ruling that raises the prospect of victims’ families being paid compensation.

A Dutch-led international investigation concluded in 2016 that the Amsterdam-to-Kuala Lumpur airliner was shot down on July 17, 2014, from Ukrainian territory held by separatist rebels using a Buk missile system delivered from Russia. Moscow denies any involvement in the MH17 tragedy.

The Netherlands and Australian governments brought the case against Moscow before the Montreal-based global aviation agency in 2022, and on Tuesday welcomed the verdict.

The International Court of Justice wasn't an option, because Russia doesn't recognize The Hague, Netherlands-based court’s jurisdiction.

The council found that Russia had violated the Convention on International Civil Aviation, known as the Chicago Convention, which requires that states “refrain from resorting to the use of weapons against civil aircraft in flight.”

It's the first time that the council, which represents 193 member states, has decided a dispute between governments.

Dutch Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp said that the council would consider the question of reparations within weeks.

“In that context, the Netherlands and Australia are requesting that the ICAO Council order the Russian Federation to enter into negotiations with the Netherlands and Australia, and that the Council facilitate this process,” Veldkamp said in a statement.

“The latter is important in order to ensure that the negotiations are conducted in good faith and according to specific timelines, and that they will yield actual results,” he added.

Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong urged the council to move swiftly to “determine remedies.”

“We call on Russia to finally face up to its responsibility for its horrific act of violence and make reparations for its egregious conduct, as required under international law,” Wong said in a statement.

The Russian Embassy in Australia didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.

Australian National University international law expert Don Rothwell said that the council had yet to publish the reasons for its decisions.

“One of the consequences for this process will be that the council will probably make some recommendations that Russia pay what are called reparations, which is an international term for damages, as a result of its violation of international law,” Rothwell said.

“So we have to wait and see exactly what the council finds on that particular point,” Rothwell added.","(AP Photo/Vadim Ghirda, File)FILE - A pro-Russian rebel touches the MH17 wreckage at the crash site of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, near the village of Hrabove, eastern Ukraine, on July 22, 2014.

As dozens of Russia-aligned world leaders gathered in Moscow to pay homage to its military, state media spotted one guest standing out from the crowd — the '90s Hollywood action star Steven Seagal.

Between shots of armored vehicles rumbling down the cobbled streets near the Kremlin, Seagal appeared briefly in a close-up during the state media outlet Izvestia's coverage of Russia's Victory Day.

A separate clip of the movie martial artist moving through the crowd on Friday also circulated on social media over the weekend.

The French news agency Agence France-Presse reported from Moscow that Seagal was seen sitting near a Russian nationalist biker gang called the Night Wolves.

Seagal, a longtime friend of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has been vocal about his support for Moscow and gained Russian citizenship in 2016. Russia's foreign ministry made Seagal a special representative in 2018 to promote Russian culture to the US, and he continued to publicly align himself with the Kremlin after it invaded Ukraine.

He wasn't the only US movie personality to attend Friday's parade. Oliver Stone, a three-time Oscar-winning director who's made a four-hour documentary about Putin, was also photographed at the event.

Stone has also often praised Putin, calling him a ""great leader"" in a May 2023 interview with The Guardian. The director was photographed shaking Putin's hand during a reception for foreign leaders on Friday.

Their appearance at the parade marks how Russia sought to elevate the grandeur of this year's event for the 80th anniversary of Nazi Germany's surrender in World War II.

The past two years' Victory Day parades had featured scaled-back processions, largely believed to be because of Russia conserving resources such as tanks and aircraft for the war. A few world leaders — mostly from eastern European and central Asian states — had appeared to watch the event.

On Friday, however, Moscow put on a full show for roughly two dozen leaders, including China's Xi Jinping, in attendance.

Iskander and Yars ballistic missiles, Tornado-S multiple rocket launchers, and modern T-90 main battle tanks wheeled past a raft of cameras on the street, and Su-25 fighter jets roared over central Moscow with colored smoke.

Also featured in the procession for the first time were Russian attack drones, which have become the Kremlin's staple weapons in the war.

The days leading up to the parade, meant to be a demonstration of Russia's strength and confidence in its military, saw Ukraine threatening Moscow with several waves of attempted drone strikes that forced nearby airports to close temporarily.

Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy had warned world leaders earlier that week that they could face risk by attending the Victory Day parade.

""Our position is very simple for all countries travelling to Russia on May 9: We cannot be held responsible for what happens on the territory of the Russian Federation,"" Zelenskyy said.

During the actual parade, Russia cut off internet access in central Moscow and said it had stepped up measures to counter drone threats.","As dozens of Russia-aligned world leaders gathered in Moscow to pay homage to its military, state media spotted one guest standing out from the crowd — the '90s Hollywood action star Steven Seagal.

(AP) — A federal grand jury indicted a Wisconsin judge Tuesday on charges she helped a man in the country illegally evade U.S. immigration authorities looking to arrest him as he appeared before her in a local domestic abuse case.

Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan’s arrest and ensuing indictment has escalated a clash between President Donald Trump’s administration and local authorities over the Republican’s sweeping immigration crackdown. Democrats have accused the Trump administration of trying to make a national example of Dugan to chill judicial opposition to the crackdown.

Prosecutors charged Dugan in April via complaint with concealing an individual to prevent arrest and obstruction. In the federal criminal justice system, prosecutors can initiate charges against a defendant directly by filing a complaint or present evidence to a grand jury and let that body decide whether to issue charges.

A grand jury still reviews charges brought by complaint to determine whether enough probable cause exists to continue the case as a check on prosecutors’ power. If the grand jury determines there’s probable cause, it issues a written statement of the charges known as an indictment. That’s what happened in Dugan’s case.

Dugan faces up to six years in prison if she’s convicted on both counts. Her team of defense attorneys responded to the indictment with a one-sentence statement saying that she maintains her innocence and looks forward to being vindicated in court. She was scheduled to enter a plea on Thursday.

Kenneth Gales, a spokesperson for the U.S. attorney’s office in Milwaukee, declined to comment on the indictment Tuesday evening.

Dugan’s case is similar to one brought during the first Trump administration against a Massachusetts judge, who was accused of helping a man sneak out a courthouse back door to evade a waiting immigration enforcement agent. That case was eventually dismissed.

Prosecutors say Dugan escorted Eduardo Flores-Ruiz and his lawyer out of her courtroom through a back jury door on April 18 after learning that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were in the courthouse seeking his arrest.

According to court documents, Flores-Ruiz illegally reentered the U.S. after being deported in 2013. Online state court records show he was charged with three counts of misdemeanor domestic abuse in Milwaukee County in March. He was in Dugan’s courtroom that morning of April 18 for a hearing.

Court documents suggest Dugan was alerted to the agents’ presence by her clerk, who was informed by an attorney that the agents appeared to be in the hallway. An affidavit says Dugan was visibly angry over the agents’ arrival and called the situation “absurd” before leaving the bench and retreating to her chambers. She and another judge later approached members of the arrest team in the courthouse with what witnesses described as a “confrontational, angry demeanor.”

After a back-and-forth with the agents over the warrant for Flores-Ruiz, Dugan demanded they speak with the chief judge and led them away from the courtroom, according to the affidavit.

She then returned to the courtroom and was heard saying words to the effect of “wait, come with me” and ushered Flores-Ruiz and his attorney out through a back jury door typically used only by deputies, jurors, court staff and in-custody defendants, according to the affidavit. Flores-Ruiz was free on a signature bond in the abuse case at the time, according to online state court records.

Federal agents ultimately captured him outside the courthouse after a foot chase.

The state Supreme Court suspended Dugan from the bench in late April, saying the move was necessary to preserve public confidence in the judiciary. A reserve judge is filling in for her.","MADISON, Wis.

Omaha and its suburbs have played a unique role in national politics, as the “blue dot” in a conservative state that wields an unusual amount of power in presidential contests. Though Democrats outnumber Republicans in the city limits of Omaha, Stothert kept her seat over three terms by building a broad-based coalition that included the city’s many independent voters. But Ewing’s campaign and Democrats sought to tie her to economic uncertainty and anger about Trump, whom she backed in 2024.

Ewing said Tuesday night that his victory belonged to “every resident of the city of Omaha” and that his campaign had demonstrated that when voters unite around shared values “we can achieve remarkable things.”

“Throughout this campaign, we’ve engaged in honest conversation about the challenges and the opportunities facing us and our city,” Ewing said, noting his focus on the need for affordable housing, living-wage jobs and “equitable economic development that revitalizes all neighborhoods, not just the select few.”

“As your mayor, I am committed to addressing those challenges head-on,” Ewing said. “There are no excuses. We’re going to get it done.”

In her concession speech, Stothert said she was proud of “twelve years of progress, determination and success.”

“I am hopeful that the momentum that we have created will continue,” she said. “We have remained true to our goals from the very beginning of 2013 with great, great success to improve public safety, to manage the city budget and spend your tax dollars wisely, to increase employment and economic development and to improve the taxpayer experience.”

The election was a fresh test of voter attitudes in a politically competitive slice of the country. The seat held by Stothert is technically nonpartisan, but disquiet over Trump’s agenda produced a surge of Democratic energy — reminiscent of the closer-than-expected special elections for Republican-held seats in Florida and a decisive victory for Democrats in the high-stakes Wisconsin Supreme Court race.

Democratic Mayors Association President Justin M. Bibb congratulated Ewing for simultaneously flipping a Republican seat and making history: “With over four decades of service to the Omaha community … John brings unmatched experience and deep integrity to City Hall,” said Bibb, who is the mayor of Cleveland. “He has spent his life delivering results, building trust, and fighting for safer streets, better infrastructure, and more opportunities for working families.”

Ewing, who is the Douglas County treasurer and a former Omaha deputy police chief, and Stothert, who made history as the city’s first female mayor when she was elected in 2013, focused primarily on local issues such as business development, police hiring, affordable housing and the revitalization of the city’s urban core.

But Ewing ran ads critical of Stothert for backing Trump in 2024. The Republican mayor, in turn, aired ads suggesting Ewing “stands with radicals” on the issue of “boys in girls’ bathrooms and sports” — leading his campaign to demand a retraction.

Omaha and its suburbs are likely to be one of the most closely contested battlegrounds in the race for control of the U.S. House next year, when moderate Republican Rep. Don Bacon, a skilled retail politician who has narrowly held his district, is up for reelection. (He has said he will decide this summer whether to run again.)

Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District has long been a unique battleground. For a moment this past fall, when the presidential race between Vice President Kamala Harris and Trump looked nail-bitingly close, the “blue dot” encompassing Omaha and its suburbs could have determined the winner with its one electoral college vote as a tiebreaker.

The district has a high number of college-educated voters and is one of the most urban in the country held by a Republican. Even though the city of Omaha is just one part of the district, Democrats were closely monitoring Tuesday’s results as another key test of whether Trump’s falling poll numbers and the uncertainty surrounding the economy and tariffs would benefit their unpopular party.

In an interview before the election, Ewing said he worked to “capture the momentum of all of the different blue dot groups and get them to be as focused on this election as they are on national elections, reminding them that the local elections actually have more impact on their lives.”

Democrats faced a formidable opponent in Stothert, a former intensive care nurse who raised nearly twice as much money as Ewing, according to recent campaign finance filings. While Democrats have a registration advantage over Republicans within Omaha — 39 percent to 32 percent — more than a quarter of the city’s voters are not registered with either party. The April 1 primary vote was split among five candidates, with Stothert leading Ewing by a narrower margin than expected.

Stothert, whose campaign did not respond to interview requests, cited Trump’s low approval rating as a concern in a recent interview with Tony Bock, the founder of the daily podcast “Omapod.” She said she supported Trump last year because she wanted a more secure border and a better economy.

But, Stothert said in the Omapod interview before the election, “I can honestly say as a Republican, I don’t like everything he’s doing and decisions he’s making. I wish he’d slow down on a lot of these decisions he’s making. I don’t advise the president.”

The mayor’s race also unfolded as Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin, who was elected in early February, was making major investments to help Democrats compete up and down the ballot in red states. The DNC recently increased its monthly investment in the Nebraska Democratic Party and is now spending 20 percent of its budget on state parties.

“There was such a focus in previous years on concentrating resources in Washington, D.C., and then in the eight battleground states — and that was it,” said Nebraska Democratic Party Chair Jane Kleeb, a close ally of Martin who also heads the Association of State Democratic Committees. With the infusion of money state parties can rely on, she said, they will be able “to do the organizing that we need to do to win races.”

Nebraska is one of only two states that divide electoral votes among statewide and congressional district winners. And the 2nd District had been viewed as critically important for Democrats because of the diminished electoral strength of the “blue wall” of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania after the congressional redistricting process in 2020. During the 2024 race, Trump and allies such as Charlie Kirk, the influential conservative head of Turning Point USA, led an intensive pressure campaign to convince Nebraska legislators to change the way the state awards electoral votes.

Republicans’ push to make Nebraska a winner-take-all state was unsuccessful. But the country went mostly red in November as Trump won all the critical swing states. Still, Harris succeeded in winning the blue dot by more than four points. It was one of only three congressional districts in the country that split its ticket between Harris and a House Republican.

Resources from the DNC allowed the Nebraska state party to build on young voters’ connection to Harris in 2024 and focus attention on the mayoral race, Kleeb said. The party paid for text messaging, three rounds of mail, canvassing and digital ads targeting younger voters that cast Stothert as aligned with Trump on issues such as abortion and climate change.

Congratulating Ewing Tuesday night, Martin, the DNC chair, said in statement that “Democrats are overwhelmingly outperforming Republicans in nearly every election held this year — as voters condemn Republicans’ plot to attack Social Security and health care while hiking prices on working families every chance they get.”

Chuck Schumer and Jack Reed also signed on to the letter.

Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., is requesting that the Department of Defense's Office of Inspector General launch an inquiry on the department's role in ""facilitating and serving as a pass-through"" for the Trump administration to accept a luxury jet donated by the Qatari government to use as Air Force One, ABC News has exclusively learned.

President Donald Trump confirmed on social media this week an ABC News report that his administration was preparing to accept the aircraft, calling it a ""very public and transparent transaction"" with the Defense Department.

In a letter sent on Tuesday, also signed by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Senate Armed Services Committee ranking member Jack Reed, D-R.I., along with six other Senate Democrats, Schiff raised to acting Inspector General Steven Stebbins a number of constitutional, legal and national security concerns related to the possible gift from Qatar.

""Public reports raise the troubling prospect that the Administration involved DOD to (1) launder this impermissible gift, so that the Department could provide cover to give the transfer of the plane the appearance of an official gift; (2) place the onus on DOD to retrofit the plane at considerable cost to U.S. taxpayers; and (3) ultimately transfer it to President Trump's library prior to the end of his term for his continued use in a personal capacity,"" the senators wrote in the letter.

The Democrats asked Stebbins to launch an inquiry into the DOD's involvement with facilitating the potential foreign gift transfer and requested a ""comprehensive audit and investigation"" into any ""fraud, waste, and abuse"" when a potential transfer is completed, given that a mandatory retrofit of the plane would need to occur if it were to be used as Air Force One. They also asserted that the Trump administration is sidestepping constitutionally provided congressional guardrails by accepting the foreign gift.

""DOD risks becoming embroiled in a brazen attempt to evade constitutional limitations on the acceptance of personal gifts from foreign governments without congressional approval,"" they continued in his letter.

The letter also requested, ""in classified form if needed,"" the cost estimate and probable timeline for retrofitting and installing communications and other equipment necessary to meet security and counterintelligence requirements for the Air Force One fleet and any timeline the White House has dictated for this plane to be ready for use by Trump.

They also asked whether necessary modifications can be made within such a time frame to meet Air Force One standards and what possible risks could be associated with that timeline. Additionally, they asked for answers on whether the existing contract for other Air Force One aircraft will continue or be terminated and what the cost of any termination would be.

The final request is whether there would be any counterintelligence and security risks with incorporating this aircraft, provided by a foreign government, into the Air Force One fleet.

""The DoD OIG received the letter this afternoon and we are reviewing it,"" Pentagon Office of Inspector General spokeswoman Mollie Halpern said in a statement.

The primary aircraft used in the current Air Force One fleet include two aging Boeing 747-200 jumbo jets that have been operational since the early 1990s. The Air Force contract with Boeing to replace those aircraft has been riddled with delays and cost overruns, with Boeing's most recent estimated delivery date now slated for 2027.

Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense ranking member Chris Coons, D-Del., and Sens. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., are the other Democrats who signed Schiff's letter.

Earlier on Tuesday, Schumer sent a separate letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi expressing concern about the ""appearance of naked corruption"" posed by Trump's reported plans to accept a jet from the Qatari government. Schumer also said he believes the jet poses a ""grave security risk"" and cited reporting that Bondi personally signed off on the transaction. In light of what Schumer called Bondi's ""central role in approving the proposal,"" he asked Bondi to respond to a number of questions related to the proposed gifted plane.

She was diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer — an aggressive and difficult-to-treat form of the disease — in 2021. She said she had to apply for Medicaid multiple times and wasn’t approved until four months later, which meant she had to pay for multiple screenings while waiting.

Bachman no longer qualifies for Medicaid because she's cancer-free. But she worries that the proposed revisions could make it harder for her or others in similar situations to get covered again, or even cause them to give up on the process altogether.

Bachman is still within five years of her diagnosis, and her doctors tell her that it’s essential for her to continue being monitored in case the cancer returns.

“It’s one of the hardest parts of this journey, besides fighting for your life,” Bachman said of applying for Medicaid. “The application process, the figuring how and when to find coverage, being someone who had no coverage at all.”

As House Republicans on Tuesday haggled over parts of a bill that proposes deep cuts and new restrictions on Medicaid, patients and doctors who rely on the program said they’re bracing for the worst, including overwhelming red tape and administrative hurdles that could prevent many people from getting the care they need.

The legislation, introduced Sunday by the Energy and Commerce Committee, proposes a slew of changes to the health program, such as work requirements, patient co-pays for doctor visits, tougher eligibility checks and citizenship verification. The panel began marking it up Tuesday and hopes to send it to the full House this week, with the goal of passing the entire bill by Memorial Day.

The legislation could lead to 8.6 million people losing Medicaid coverage, according to a preliminary estimate from the Congressional Budget Office. More than 70 million people currently get health coverage through the program.

The changes would make some people ineligible for coverage due to work requirements. Certain groups, such as the disabled, pregnant women and people who are in prison or rehabilitation centers, would be exempt.

Others — particularly those covered under the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion — could be forced to drop out as they face higher fees and additional paperwork to maintain their coverage.

Republicans say they’re fine with the new rules — including Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., who has publicly and repeatedly warned his party not to slash Medicaid benefits.

“Based on the work requirement, anti-fraud provisions — there’s going to be coverage losses associated with that, which I’m OK with,” Hawley told NBC News. Republicans are proposing cutting spending to states that allow immigrants without proof of citizenship to be on Medicaid.

“But for people who are otherwise qualified, who are able bodied and are working and need Medicaid because they cannot otherwise afford health insurance, I just am opposed to cutting these people’s benefits,” he said.

Asked if he worries the red tape could end up removing rightful Medicaid recipients from coverage, Hawley downplayed the prospect saying his priority is “just no benefit cuts.”

The Medicaid provisions are expected to save the government over $715 billion over 10 years, which Republicans intend to use to pay for an extension of President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cuts before they expire at the end of this year.

Democrats argue the added bureaucracy is a feature — not a bug — of the GOP plan.

Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., the ranking member of the Finance Committee that oversees Medicaid, said Republicans want to throw people off the program by putting recipients through “bureaucratic water torture” that many won’t be able to navigate.

“This whole thicket of red tape bureaucracy is being deployed in order to keep people who are eligible from getting covered,” Wyden said in an interview. “It’d be one thing if they had found a pattern of fraud and abuse, and they were trying to root it out. But what they’re doing is they are targeting eligible people who are eligible for Medicaid now.”

“I think it’s really a despicable thing,” he said.

The bill, as it stood before Tuesday’s markup, did leave out some of the more controversial ideas Republican leaders had discussed — including limits on how much Medicaid can spend per person and making states pay more for expanded coverage under the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion, for which the federal government currently pays 90%.

Dr. Adam Gaffney, a critical care physician and assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, said the proposed changes to eligibility, even the possibility of additional paperwork, will cause people to fall through the cracks and lose their coverage.

“You don’t need to be a doctor to realize that this is dangerous,” Gaffney said. “If you’re facing multiple medical problems, the last thing you need to do is try to get through a lot of red tape and jump through hoops and bureaucracy, and that’s exactly what this legislation would do.”

People who want to work may not be able to because of health issues, lack of childcare or limited transportation options.

When people lose coverage, they typically have no other options, Gaffney said. He noted that in the early 2000s, when Tennessee implemented reforms to rein in Medicaid costs, thousands of people lost coverage.

“Most people who lost Medicaid went uninsured,” he said. “The reality is Medicaid covers some of the lowest-income folks in the nation, and when they lose coverage, they’re probably not going to be able to afford it.”

Likewise, in Georgia, following the implementation of Medicaid work requirements in 2023, fewer people chose to enroll, said Robin Rudowitz, director of the program on Medicaid and the uninsured at KFF, a health policy research group.

“Basically reporting and having to document that you’re working, or even if you’re a group that might be exempt from the requirements, sometimes it’s just hard to document that you might be in one of those groups,” she said.

Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., said the new rules are part of a “cruel” and “craven” plot.

“Any added bureaucracy will take people who are justifiably using these services and make it more difficult for them to get on, which will result in loss of coverage — again, for Americans who have sicknesses and illnesses,” Booker said.

Rudowitz said the bill proposes a provision that would require patient co-pays for people with incomes up to 130% to 138% of the federal poverty level— around $35,000 a year for a family of three. There’s also a provision, she said, that would reduce the amount the federal government gives states if they provide coverage for undocumented immigrants.

If the bill clears the House, it goes to the Senate, where some Republicans are eying changes.

Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who sits on the Finance Committee, said Republicans must take a close look at the new Medicaid rules and coverage impacts.

“That’s what we’re going through now. A lot of that has to do with the semi-annual versus annual affirmation, that sort of stuff. We got a lot of mechanics to work out,” said Tillis, who faces re-election next year in a purple state.

Tillis also said he wants to review how many North Carolinians are among the 8.6 million projected to lose coverage. “If you look at that distribution across the country, it probably means sizable numbers in North Carolina,” he said. “This false narrative that we’re going to pick up that bill and pass it as proposed — we got a lot of work to do.”","The legislation could lead to 8.6 million people losing Medicaid coverage, according to a preliminary estimate from the Congressional Budget Office.

The Episcopal Church is ending its nearly 40-year refugee resettlement partnership with the U.S. government after refusing a Trump administration request to help resettle white Afrikaners from South Africa.

The church cited its commitment to racial justice as a moral imperative in a letter sent to its members Monday.

Presiding Bishop Sean Rowe explained to NPR's Morning Edition that the administration's request crossed a moral line, and that the church would not help while other refugee programs remain largely frozen by the White House.

""The idea that we would be somehow resettling Afrikaners at this point over other refugees who have been vetted and waiting in camps for months or even years, is unfathomable to us,"" Rowe, the church's youngest presiding bishop ever, said.

President Trump has repeatedly claimed, without evidence, that white South African farmers, known as Afrikaners, are facing genocide and land seizures. The Trump administration classified the white Afrikaners as refugees earlier this year. Speaking to reporters at the White House on Monday, Trump said: ""It's a genocide that's taking place that you people don't want to write about, but it's a terrible thing that's taking place. And farmers are being killed. They happen to be white, but whether they're white or Black makes no difference to me, but white farmers are being brutally killed, and their land is being confiscated in South Africa.""

NPR reported this week that while South Africa passed a land reform law earlier this year allowing, in rare cases, for land expropriation without compensation, no land has been seized. White South Africans make up about 7% of the population yet own around 70% of commercial farmland.

In this interview with NPR's Michel Martin, Rowe reflected on the values that led the church to end its partnership with the current administration.

Interview highlights

Michel Martin: Tell us more about what went into the decision to end the migration ministry.

Sean Rowe: Well, the reality is, we don't feel like we can be ourselves in the Episcopal Church and take the step of resettling white Afrikaners from South Africa. Our church has a commitment to racial justice and reconciliation. We have historic ties with the church in South Africa, particularly the Anglican Church, our sister church there. So we're not able to take this step. And in addition to that, we're sad and really in a shame that many of the refugees who are being denied entrance to the U.S. are people who've worked alongside our military in Iraq and Afghanistan and now face danger at home. We just can't see that having fast tracked Afrikaners in this way is morally just.

Martin: I want to mention that Archbishop Desmond Tutu was part of the Anglican community. He was an Anglican cleric. He was, of course, awarded the Nobel Prize, in part for his leadership in opposing apartheid. Was that heritage, I would call it, part of what motivated the decision of the Episcopal Church?

Rowe: Absolutely, Episcopalians have been partners in that work. We've opposed apartheid from the beginning. Desmond Tutu was a teacher to us, and we were a partner to him. In fact, his young seminarian, I remember driving him around Washington, D.C. during one of his visits. We have strong ties to that country and to that fight against racism and the apartheid regime. And the idea that we would be somehow resettling Afrikaners at this point over other refugees, who have been vetted and waiting in camps for months or even years, is unfathomable to us.

Martin: The president claims that these folks, the Afrikaners, are being subjected to racist harassment. I think he even used the word genocide at one point for the record. You just say that's just not true?

Rowe: Yeah, I don't think the data bears that out. And certainly genocide, that's really a bridge too far.

Martin: Shortly after taking office, President Trump halted, as we said, nearly all refugee entry into the United States. Why do you think he seems to have such deep sympathy for Afrikaners and so little for people from other parts of the world?

Rowe: That's a really good question. I really don't don't understand why this is the way it is, except that it seems to me that some people are more valuable than others. And in this case, it seems to be that people who are white seem to be more valuable than those who are people of color. And in any case, the way that this has happened, the decision making, the criteria that has gone into this just doesn't fit with our morals and the values that we hold as a church.

Martin: So what impact has this refugee pause had on the work that you do? This pause on refugees from everywhere other than these white South Africans?

Rowe: Since 1980 we've settled more than 100,000 refugees and so have our other partner agencies with the government. What has happened since January is that this program has entirely been shut down. So now no refugees, almost no refugees are being coming into the United States, and now, all of a sudden, Afrikaners have been fast tracked over people who have assisted the government, over people who are being persecuted for their religion and for their political stance all around the world, people waiting to be reunified with their families, and now we've got Afrikaners coming in at this point. It just doesn't make any sense.

Sponsor Message

Martin: After your partnership with the U.S. government officially ends in September, what will your work with migrants look like after that?

Rowe: We're gonna pivot our work to work with immigration and migration on the ground. We can't be partners with the federal government at this point, but we will continue our work and our advocacy to the most vulnerable. That's what Jesus calls us to, to care for the poor and the most vulnerable. And we will continue that work.","Episcopal Church leader says helping Afrikaners over other refugees is 'unfathomable'toggle caption Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty ImagesThe Episcopal Church is ending its nearly 40-year refugee resettlement partnership with the U.S. government after refusing a Trump administration request to help resettle white Afrikaners from South Africa.

S. storm system caused flooding in the area. About 140 students and staff from Westernport Elementary in Allegany County were evacuated and taken to locations around town, said Jonathan Dayton, a spokesman and firefighter for Potomac Fire Company No. 2, a volunteer department.

Water levels rose as high as one foot outside the school’s main entrance, Dayton said, but it was not immediately clear how much of that water entered the building.

Later in the afternoon, Allegany County’s emergency services department said students at George’s Creek Elementary were also being relocated, while students at a third school — Westmar Middle — were sheltering in place.

By Tuesday night, students from Westernport Elementary and Westmar Middle Schools had been taken to Mountain Ridge High School, according to the Allegany Public Schools Facebook page. All public schools in the county will be closed Wednesday.

The Allegany school system had dismissed most of its schools at 2 p.m. and canceled after-school activities Tuesday after the National Weather Service warned of hazardous, life-threatening flooding conditions. The flood warning will remain until 11:15 p.m. Tuesday, according to the Maryland Department of Emergency Management.

The agency issued flood warnings Tuesday for much of Western Maryland. Flood warnings in Allegany and Garrett Counties remain in place until around midnight, the department wrote on X. As of about 4 p.m., Washington County is under a flood warning while Frederick County is under a flood watch.

Rain associated with an eastern-U. S. storm system moved into the mountains of Western Maryland on Monday night, becoming heavy around sunrise Tuesday. Through early afternoon, heavy rain continued to redevelop over the region, dropping up to an inch of rain per hour.

At least 2 to 4 inches fell in the mountainous terrain with the morning to midday activity. Some spots near Westernport probably picked up more. Rapid runoff of water flowing downhill quickly filled creeks and streams, leading to flooding.

A rare flash flood emergency — issued when life-threatening flooding is ongoing — was hoisted this afternoon there, among several other flood warnings through the day.

Georges Creek, which runs through the town, witnessed swift rises through much of Tuesday. The creek empties into the North Branch of the Potomac River next to Westernport Elementary. Other nearby businesses and residences have also been affected.

At 7 a.m. Tuesday, the water level gauge there was at 4.25 feet, or several feel below flooding. By midafternoon it was at major flood, around 12 feet. The rate of rise has since slowed.

Dayton said the Potomac Fire Company No. 2 was called out to Westernport Elementary after 1:30 p.m. and the rescue operation completed just before 5 p.m.

“Everything was done by boat and motorcraft, so you can only take a few people at a time,” Dayton said. “Everyone, as far as I’m aware, was not necessarily in major danger, they just needed to be moved to a higher location.”

Alley Wade said she was in a full-blown panic trying to get home. Wade, 33, works as a nurse in Oakland, Maryland, which she says is about a 30-minute drive from her home in Westernport. Her two sons, William, 10, and Quinton, 8, attend the elementary school and were stuck inside because of the flooding.

She was already upset because she said neither her nor her husband got an emergency alert from the county. Wade first got a text from her mother, who works in a neighboring county, asking if the boys were getting out of school early. She eventually made it to the school around 2 p.m. and stood on a hill that overlooked an area where children were being evacuated.

“I felt helpless because my kids are stuck in there and the water is rising,” Wade said.

Wade said that she saw William emerge first on a rescue boat about 4 p.m. Quinton soon followed at 4:11 p.m., she said. Officials later told Wade that water was touching the ceiling of the first floor.

Mexican Security Secretary Omar García Harfuch confirmed a report by independent journalist Luis Chaparro that family members of Ovidio Guzman Lopez, who was extradited to the United States in 2023, had entered the U.S.

Guzmán Lopez is one of the brothers left running a faction of the Sinaloa Cartel after notorious capo Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán was imprisoned in the U.S. Video showed the family members walking across the border from Tijuana with their suitcases to waiting U.S. agents.

Rumors had circulated last week that the younger Guzmán would plead guilty to avoid trial for several drug trafficking charges in the U.S. after being extradited in 2023.

García Harfuch confirmed the family members’ crossing in a radio interview and said it was clear to Mexican authorities that they were doing so after negotiations between Guzmán López and the U.S. government.

He believed that was the case because the former cartel boss, whose lawyer said in January he had entered negotiations with U.S. authorities, had been pointing fingers at members of other criminal organizations likely as part of a cooperation agreement.

“It is evident that his family is going to the U.S. because of a negotiation or an offer that the Department of Justice is giving him,” Garcia Harfuch said.

He said that none of the family members were being pursued by Mexican authorities and that the government of U.S. President Donald Trump “has to share information” with Mexican prosecutors, something it has not yet done.

The confirmation by García Harfuch comes the same day that the U.S. Attorney General’s Office announced it was charging a number of top cartel leaders with “narcoterrorism” for the first time since the Trump administration declared a number of cartels as foreign terrorist organizations.

While prosecutors declined to comment on the video of the family, U.S. Attorney Adam Gordon for the Southern District of California and other officials sent a warning to cartel members, repeatedly citing the Sinaloa Cartel by name.

“Let me be direct, to the leaders of the Sinaloa Cartel, you are no longer the hunters, you are the hunted. You will be betrayed by your friends, you will be hounded by your enemies, and you will ultimately find yourself and your face here in a courtroom in the Southern District of California,” Gordon said.","MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico’s security chief confirmed Tuesday that 17 family members of cartel leaders crossed into the U.S. last week as part of a deal between a son of the former head of the Sinaloa Cartel and the Trump administration.

“His rise is not just a religious milestone, it’s a historical affirmation,” genealogist and former official Louisiana state archivist Alex DaPaul Lee said of the man previously known as Cardinal Robert Prevost.

When Lee first heard about the pope’s Creole roots from fellow genealogist Jamarlon Glenn, he responded, “There’s no way,” Lee said with a laugh. “But then I began going down a rabbit hole of research.”

Lee, the founder of Alex Genealogy and Southwest Louisiana Genealogy Researchers, discovered troves of documents in his collection and gathered records from his network of genealogists that confirmed information about Pope Leo’s background. It also showed generations of Catholicism within Prevost’s family.

“It didn’t take long for me to realize that he was a Creole from the seventh ward of New Orleans, Louisiana, which was a prominent place for Louisiana Creoles,” he said.

The news of the pope’s Creole roots was also noted by genealogist Jari C. Honora. Leo’s brother John Prevost confirmed the connection to The New York Times and said he and his brothers had never talked about it. “It was never an issue,” John Prevost told the Times.

Although his paternal surname, “Prevost,” is common in Louisiana, Lee said a strong Creole connection was actually found in Pope Leo’s maternal ancestry: His great-great-grandmother Celeste Lemelle was the daughter of two free people of color, Louis Lemelle and Celeste Olimpie Grandpres. They married in Opelousas, Louisiana, in 1798, and were legally classified as “quadroons.”

“That meant they would have a fourth African ancestry or it could have been Native American ancestry,” Lee said.

The Creole community emerged in Louisiana due to the blending of cultures there. French, Native American, Spanish, German and descendants of West African countries all cohabitated in the region during the pre-colonial era when France and Spain owned the Louisiana territory.

In Louisiana during the 1700s, there were three main racial categories: the enslaved, Gens de Couleur Libres (free people of color/Creoles of color) and the white planter class, according to Lee.

The classifications within the Creole community were based on legal status and racial identity, with other categories like “mulatto” and “octoroon” often showing up within historic documents, Lee said. He added that there were also Creoles of color who owned enslaved people at the time. Documentation shows that the Lemelle family once owned enslaved people.

Lee said the Lemelle family, which traced its wealth to cattle ranching, became one of the most prominent Creole families during the Antebellum period in Louisiana.

The pope’s great-great-grandmother Celeste Lemelle was a free woman of color and documents show she was given earnings from a business owned by Ferdinand Gayarré in December of 1833. In addition, she was also given land in 1850 from Frédéric Guimont, a merchant whom she had several children with. The transaction was irrevocable as a way to protect her ownership of it, Lee said.

“One of the most significant things about Louisiana was that women could own property and they have been owning property since its early inception, especially free women of color,” Lee said.

Lee pointed out where the change of racial identity can be seen within Pope Leo’s family during the 1800s.

Celeste Lemelle’s son Ferdinand David Baquie, born in New Orleans on Oct. 10, 1837, was listed as “mulatto” in the 1870 census. But in 1880, he and his entire family were listed as white.

In terms of how Pope Leo’s family ended up in Illinois, Lee said his family was likely part of the hundreds of other Louisiana Creoles who migrated north during the first wave of the Great Migration in the early 1900s.

“Illinois was once part of the Louisiana territory. They had an old post by the name of Kaskaskia where they had some of the earliest Creole people,” Lee said, adding that people of color would have had more job opportunities and better civil liberties in the northern state.

“Considering the fact that many of these families passed for white in Chicago meant they were going to have more success, regardless, because of their appearance.”

Lee said it’s notable that the pope’s racial background reflects the diverse blends of cultures that have historically merged to form the unique identity of Louisiana.

“In America, a lot of people think everything is just Black or white,” he said. “But it’s important to note that the pope’s ancestry represents a more inclusive view of what it means to be a Catholic, and what it means to be an American with Louisiana Creole ties. This is more than just genealogy, it’s a legacy.”","Alex DaPaul Lee, founder of Alex Genealogy and Southwest Louisiana Genealogy Researchers.

A federal court held the very first hearing on President Donald Trump’s wide-ranging, so-called Liberation Day tariffs on Tuesday, offering the earliest window into whether those tariffs — and potentially all of the shifting tariffs Trump has imposed since he retook office — will be struck down. The case is V.O.S. Selections v. Trump.

It is unclear how the three-judge panel that heard the case will rule, but it appears somewhat more likely than not that they will rule that the tariffs are unlawful. All three of the judges, who sit on the US Court of International Trade, appeared troubled by the Trump administration’s claim that the judiciary may not review the legality of the tariffs at all. But Jeffrey Schwab, the lawyer representing several small businesses challenging the tariffs, also faced an array of skeptical questions.

Many of the judges’ questions focused on United States v. Yoshida International (1975), a federal appeals court decision which upheld a 10 percent tariff President Richard Nixon briefly imposed on nearly all foreign goods.

That is understandable: Yoshida remains binding on the trade court, and the three judges must take it into account when they make their decision. It is not, however, binding upon the Supreme Court, whose justices will be free to ignore Yoshida if they want. Ultimately, that means it is unclear how much influence the trade court’s eventual decision will have over the Supreme Court, which is likely to have the final word on the tariffs.

At the heart of V.O.S. Selections are four key words in the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA), the statute Trump relied on when he imposed these tariffs.

That statute permits the president to “regulate” transactions involving foreign goods — a verb which Yoshida held is expansive enough to permit tariffs — but only “to deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat with respect to which a national emergency has been declared.” It is likely that the trade court’s decision will turn on what the words “unusual and extraordinary threat” means. While Yoshida offered guidance on “regulate,” there appears to be few, if any, precedents interpreting what those four words mean.

In his executive order laying out the rationale for these tariffs, Trump claimed they are needed to combat “large and persistent annual US goods trade deficits” — meaning that the United States buys more goods from many countries than it sells to them. But it’s far from clear how this trade deficit, which has existed for decades, qualifies as either “unusual” or “extraordinary.”

Schwab seemed to flub several direct questions from the judges asking him to come up with a universal rule they could apply to determine which “threats” are “unusual” or “extraordinary.” When Judge Gary Katzmann, an Obama appointee, asked Schwab to name the best case supporting his argument that a trade deficit is neither unusual nor extraordinary, for example, Schwab was unable to do so.

That said, some of the judges sounded outright offended when Eric Hamilton, the lawyer for the Trump administration, claimed that the question of what constitutes an unusual or extraordinary threat is a “political question” — a legal term meaning that the courts aren’t allowed to decide that matter. As Judge Jane Restani, a Reagan appointee, told Hamilton, his argument suggests that there is “no limit” to the president’s power to impose tariffs, even if the president claims that a shortage of peanut butter is a national emergency.

The overall picture presented by the argument is that all three judges (the third is Judge Timothy Reif, a Trump appointee) are troubled by the broad power Trump claims in this case. But they were also frustrated by a lack of guidance — both from existing case law and from Schwab and Hamilton’s arguments — on whether Trump can legally claim the power to issue such sweeping tariffs.

What the Nixon precedent tells us about Trump’s tariffs

Early in the argument, Schwab appeared to be in trouble, as he faced a barrage of questions about how the Yoshida decision cuts against some of his arguments. As Restani told him at one point, the argument that a statute permitting the president to “regulate” does not include the power to impose tariffs is a nonstarter, because Yoshida held the opposite.

That said, all three judges proposed ways to distinguish the Nixon tariffs upheld by Yoshida from the Trump tariffs now before the trade court.

Restani, for her part, argued that the Nixon tariffs involved a “very different situation” that was both “new” and “extraordinary.” For several decades, US dollars could be readily converted into gold at a set exchange rate. Nixon ended this practice in 1971, in an event many still refer to as the “Nixon shock.” When he did so, he briefly imposed tariffs to protect US goods from fluctuating exchange rates.

Yoshida, in other words, upheld temporary tariffs that were enacted in order to mitigate the impact of a sudden and very significant shift in US monetary policy, albeit a shift that Nixon caused himself. That’s a very different situation than the one surrounding Trump’s tariffs, which were enacted in response to ongoing trade deficits that have existed for many years.

Restani and Katzmann also pointed to a footnote in Yoshida that said Congress enacted a new law, the Trade Act of 1974, after the Nixon shock. This footnote states a future attempt to impose similar tariffs “must, of course, comply with the statute now governing such action.” Whatever power Nixon might have had in 1971, in other words, may now be limited by newer laws.

Reif also made a similar argument, pointing out that there is a separate federal statute dealing with trade practices such as “dumping,” when an exporter sells goods below their normal value. He questioned whether the president could bypass the procedures laid out in that anti-dumping statute by simply declaring an emergency, and then imposing whatever trade barriers the president wanted to impose under IEEPA.

That said, none of the judges — and neither of the lawyers — were able to articulate a rule that would allow future courts to determine which presidential actions are “unusual” or “extraordinary.” Hamilton’s suggestion that courts can’t decide this question at all sunk like a pair of concrete shoes, with Katzmann arguing that the IEEPA’s “unusual and extraordinary” provision would be entirely “superfluous” if Congress hadn’t intended courts to enforce it.

Schwab, meanwhile, earned a scolding from Restani when he kept trying to argue that Trump’s tariffs are such an obvious violation of the statute that there’s no need to come up with a broader legal rule. “You know it when you see it doesn’t work,” she told him — a reference to Justice Potter Stewart’s infamously vague standard for determining what constitutes pornography.

The three judges, in other words, expressed serious concerns about the Trump administration’s argument for the tariffs. But it’s not clear that they have figured out how to navigate the uncertain legal landscape looming over this case.

Will the decision be broad enough to matter in the long run?

Though the bulk of the argument focused on the four key words in the IEEPA, it’s not clear that a narrow decision holding that this law does not permit these tariffs will have much staying power.

Trump could potentially try to impose the tariffs again, using the somewhat more drawn out process laid out in the 1974 Trade Act, which permits the government to “impose duties or other import restrictions” after the US Trade Representative makes certain findings. So if the courts issue a narrow ruling against these tariffs, they may have to go through a very similar dog and pony show in a few months.

There are, however, two controversial legal doctrines popular with conservatives — known as “major questions” and “nondelegation” — which could lead to a more permanent reduction of Trump’s authority. Broadly speaking, both of these doctrines empower the courts to strike down a presidential administration’s actions even if those actions appear to be authorized by statute.

Late in the argument, Restani seemed to latch onto the nondelegation theory. Under current law, Congress may delegate power to the president or a federal agency so long as it “shall lay down by legislative act an intelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to [exercise the delegated authority] is directed to conform.” This “intelligible principle” test is famously very deferential to Congress.

Nevertheless, Restani asked some questions indicating that she may think that the IEEPA is the rare law which provides so little guidance to the president that it must be struck down. She noted that the law does permit Congress to pass a resolution canceling tariffs after the fact, but argued that this kind of after-the-fact review is not a substitute for an intelligible principle letting the president know how to act before he takes action.

The major questions doctrine, meanwhile, establishes that Congress must “speak clearly” if it wants to give the executive branch authority over matters of “vast ‘economic and political significance.’” By some estimates, Trump’s tariffs are expected to reduce real family income by $2,800, so that’s certainly a matter of vast economic importance. Thus, to the extent that the IEEPA’s language is unclear, the major questions doctrine suggests that the law should be construed to not permit these tariffs.

Hamilton’s primary argument against this line of reasoning is that the major questions doctrine does not apply to the president at all, only to actions by federal agencies that are subordinate to the president. But none of the three judges appeared sympathetic to this argument. Restani, in particular, seemed incredulous at the suggestion.

Overall, the judges seemed interested in exploring the nondelegation and major questions factors, and repeatedly rebutted suggestions that ruling on the tariffs was beyond their power. And that suggests the trade court will likely rule against the tariffs.","The three-judge panel on the US Court of International Trade seemed troubled by the Trump administration’s claim that the judiciary may not review the legality of President Donald Trump’s tariffs at all.

As many as 9,000 Afghan refugees are at risk of deportation, as the Trump administration has ended the temporary protected status (TPS) that allowed them to stay in the U.S. legally. The White House says their country is no longer dangerous for them, a contention that confounds Afghanistan watchers.

""It's a death penalty for them if they return,"" said Zia Ghafoori, who worked as an interpreter in combat with U.S. Army Special Forces from 2002 to 2014.

Ghafoori was received by President Trump at the White House in 2019 and became a U.S. citizen in 2020.

""He's a big supporter of our veterans and that's what we love about the president,"" Ghafoori said. ""Maybe he's not aware how the policy is going to affect our Afghan allies. I don't know what's happening behind the scenes.""

""I hope we can keep those promises that we made,"" he added. ""But unfortunately, right now I don't know how to explain that to the families that are here and living in stress and depression without any immigration status.""

Ghafoori says the move also affects thousands of Afghans in limbo, including 13 members of his own family that had been set to fly to the U.S. from Pakistan when the Trump administration canceled flights for Afghans earlier this year.

Ending TPS for Afghans is part of the administration's stated goal of realigning the United States refugee admissions program. It is a realignment that saw the Trump administration on Monday welcome the first group of white South African refugees under an executive order mandating that they be prioritized for resettlement.

""This administration is returning TPS to its original temporary intent,"" said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in a statement on Monday.

""We've reviewed the conditions in Afghanistan with our interagency partners, and they do not meet the requirements for a TPS designation. Afghanistan has had an improved security situation, and its stabilizing economy no longer prevent them from returning to their home country,"" she said.

Not forgotten

A chorus of dissenting voices has condemned the change as a betrayal to those who helped the U.S. at war or were stranded by the abrupt withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2001.

""To our Afghan allies, you are not alone, you are not forgotten,"" said Jack McCain, a veteran of the Afghan war and son of the late Sen. John McCain.

""Allies here in the United States who fought alongside people like me … who risked their lives and the lives of their families to execute our foreign policy are at the very real credible risk of deportation and in many many cases, death,"" said McCain in a statement on social media.

Bill Frelick with Human Rights Watch called the move to revoke the status for Afghans ""a betrayal of U.S. commitments.""

""The only justification for revoking temporary protection would be if permanent protection was being offered since Taliban rule clearly makes returns unsafe,"" he said.

As for Noem's assertion that the country is now safe, it left advocates wondering where the DHS is getting its information.

""I wonder if Secretary Noem is operating on the assumption that the Taliban has given promises that they're not going to put people that worked with the U.S. in harm's way?"" said Morwari Zafar, with the Georgetown University Center for Security Studies.

""Even if that were true, even if we could trust their word, it's not just the Taliban. You've got an environment where there are hostilities towards the population that would be coming back just based on the fact that they worked with the U.S. military – and also that they were the ones that got out,"" she said.

Veterans of the post-9/11 wars are among the most passionate advocates for protecting Afghans status. Many had taken encouragement that two of Trump's cabinet picks were staunch supporters of TPS for Afghans. Secretary of State Marco Rubio was one; he's recently gone quiet on the issue. Former National Security Adviser and Afghanistan war vet Mike Waltz was the other, and he appears to have been marginalized.

Some Republicans who condemned the Biden administration's ending of the Afghan war are now criticizing Trump.

""The Biden administration's withdrawal from Afghanistan was a catastrophe. Deporting Afghans who bravely helped us would be Trump's catastrophe,"" said Bradley Bowman with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. Bowman is an Afghanistan vet who also taught at West Point. He called deporting Afghan allies immoral but also short-sighted from an American national security standpoint.

""Around the world, countries are looking at the actions of the United States to determine whether Washington is a good partner that honors its commitments and stands by its friends,"" he said. ""If we deport such individuals, the consequences for those Afghans and their families may be severe and the decision will rightly be viewed as a betrayal.""

The immigration advocacy group CASA announced it has sued the Trump administration over its termination of TPS for Afghans and also Cameroonians. That action came at the same time the Trump administration made good on a promise to accept white South Africans into the U.S., citing what Trump baselessly claimed was a racial genocide against them.

Democratic Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, a Marine combat veteran, said the contrast was stark.

""As every Iraq or Afghanistan veteran knows, this is textbook betrayal. To say that the conditions in Afghanistan have improved as our allies are being hunted down is clearly absurd,"" he said in a statement to NPR. ""I know Kristi Noem doesn't understand the idea of risking your life for our country, but perhaps she understands outright racism in accepting Afrikaner 'refugees' in their place,"" he said in a statement to NPR.","White House welcomes Afrikaners to the U.S., but drops protection for Afghan alliestoggle caption Jose Luis Magana/APAs many as 9,000 Afghan refugees are at risk of deportation, as the Trump administration has ended the temporary protected status (TPS) that allowed them to stay in the U.S. legally.

For Bonnie Ross, a clothing importer based in New York, news that the U.S. would temporarily cut tariffs on China came as a relief — at least for a short time.

""It was a great relief for about five minutes,"" Ross says.

Then the scramble began.

Ross had pulled two cargo containers off ships in China when the 145% tariffs took effect last month. Now she's trying to get as much merchandise to the U.S. as she can while the lower tariffs are in place.

Still, she worries that other businesses will be in the same crowded boat.

""Now it's going to be a rush because everybody wants it out in the next 90 days,"" Ross says. ""What is going to happen to the freight rates?""

For business owners like Ross, a cut in tariffs on China is welcome news — but it also prolongs uncertainty.

Although the U.S. and China agreed to slash the crippling tariffs they had imposed on each other, the lower import taxes are set to last for only 90 days — with no certainty of what happens afterward.

The tax on Chinese imports to the U.S. will drop from 145% to 30%, while the tariff China charges on U.S. goods will fall from 125% to 10%. The remaining tariffs are still significantly higher than the U.S. was charging before President Trump launched his trade war.

Getting through the next four to six weeks

Jay Foreman, whose Florida-based company makes Tinkertoys, Lincoln Logs and other toys in China, got news of the deal at 4:30 a.m. and immediately called associates in Hong Kong to begin scheduling shipments.

""We've been holding everything at the factories and at the ports, because we didn't want to risk putting anything on containers with a 145% tariff,"" Foreman says.

He says a 30% import tax is more manageable, although at least some of that cost will have to be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices.

""It's a complete disruption, but obviously I'm sure everybody in the supply chain would agree it's better than it was,"" Foreman says.

Some businesses may race to produce and ship products early for the Christmas holiday season to avoid the risk of higher tariffs in the fall. But that's also a gamble, Foreman says, because it's possible the administration will order lower tariffs at the end of the three-month window.

""Right now, I'm just trying to get through the next four to six weeks,"" he says. ""Whether I double-shift the factories to try to get more produced and out the door before the end of the 90 days, I'll probably need another three to four weeks to figure that out.""

A temporary deal is still better than none

Jonathan Silva runs a company in Massachusetts that produces high-end board games in China. He has nine containers of merchandise that he has been holding in China that he will now send to the United States.

""We need to get product back on shelves,"" Silva says. ""I think that we were really getting close to the tipping point of starting to see some shortages.""

""30% — it's not ideal,"" he adds. ""I think there will be slight price increases.""

But at least Silva is no longer afraid of going bankrupt.

For now, like other business owners, he's scrambling to produce and ship more games in time for the holiday shopping season.

""The spigot was turned on,"" Silva says. ""Everyone is going to be placing orders over the course of the next week, and we're placing our orders today for what we think we can get done in the next 90 days and try to save as much business for the holidays as we can.""

Whatever the tariff landscape looks like in 90 days, Silva says he'll be exploring alternatives to manufacturing in China, including other Asian countries and the United States.

""The past 40 days has been the hardest 40 days in all of our business's life,"" he says. ""And I'm glad that we're going to be able to come out of it. But we don't know what's going to happen tomorrow.

Penn State President Neeli Bendapudi has asked university trustees to approve closing seven of its commonwealth campuses because the current statewide model “subsidizes decline,” according to internal records obtained by Spotlight PA. “Fulfilling our land-grant mission does not require a four-year campus in every corner of Pennsylvania,” the president wrote. Instead, under the proposal, online classes could replace some in-person offerings and a leaner university with fewer locations could invest in the parts of Pennsylvania where Penn State believes it can still succeed. Bendapudi has proposed closing Penn State’s DuBois, Fayette, Mont Alto, New Kensington, Shenango, Wilkes-Barre, and York campuses. More than 500 employees and thousands of students would be affected by the move. “These are not just campuses; they are homes, launching pads, and sources of deep pride. And yet … if we delay action, the pressures we face—demographic, financial, competitive—will continue to mount. In time, those forces will make decisions for us, not with the care, intention, or commitment to students and communities that this process allows,” Bendapudi wrote to trustees.

On Monday, the Philadelphia Inquirer first reported the list of seven campuses Bendapudi wanted to close. In response, board chair David Kleppinger said in a statement, “I find it deeply frustrating that someone with early access to this recommendation decided to share it with the media with absolutely no regard for how this information would impact members of our campus communities. Our students, faculty and staff deserve better.” But the Penn State Board of Trustees still needs to approve the plan, a vote that’s grown more contentious. Questions, as well as outright disapproval, from some trustees delayed a scheduled vote this week, according to people with knowledge of the board’s operations. Trustees will meet privately Thursday to continue discussing the proposal. Spotlight PA obtained the materials trustees are reviewing, which total almost 250 pages. The full text of the university’s recommendation and related materials offer the most detailed look to date at Penn State’s justification for potentially shuttering locations, upending the lives of thousands of employees and students, and markedly changing the educational landscape of Pennsylvania. The records provide a campus-by-campus rationale for closing, offer insights into how trustees feel about the decision, and reveal that Penn State officials anticipate minimal political and funding fallout from the move. Penn State’s Office of Strategic Communication told Spotlight PA Tuesday afternoon that “the University will not be able to make the deadline, but we will share a statement with you eventually, understanding we may not make publication.” In the documents, Penn State claims that previous university administrations failed to act. Closing campuses is presented to trustees as the only viable option: “We now have an opportunity to address what’s long been understood.” The documents note that enrollments at Penn State’s smallest 12 campuses continued declining despite more than $1 billion in investments between 2010 and 2024, including $105 million under Bendapudi. Likewise, they highlight that new academic programs, digital advertising, tuition discounts, and increased support for out-of-state and international students largely failed to boost enrollments. “The plan to close campuses was not the initial intent of this administration; rather, it was a discovered reality,” the documents say. The reasons for closing campuses Under the proposal, the new Penn State will be regionalized to incentivize larger classes and on-campus living instead of commuting. Locations that generate revenue or are near self-sustaining, those with the largest enrollments, and those in areas with growing populations will remain. Historical enrollment trends and opportunities for future growth were key factors in the university’s recommendation. Other criteria given significant weight were nearby housing availability and the ability to duplicate academic offerings at a nearby campus or online. The records include a multi-paragraph rationale for closing each of the seven campuses, which say in part: For DuBois, the main reason is “sustained and substantial enrollment decline,” the report reads. The population in the surrounding area — Clearfield, Elk, and Jefferson Counties — is aging and declining. Other organizations, like the Triangle Tech vocational school, are leaving the region too, the university argued.

At Fayette, successful programs at other campuses are not driving enrollments there. The campus is “underutilized,” and there is “limited demand for in-person education in this location.” While the local college-age population is expected to grow, Penn State faces regional competition with PennWest California and Waynesburg University.

Penn State recommends closing Mont Alto due to enrollment and demographic challenges. “The limited pool of prospective students constrains the campus’ ability to rebuild enrollment organically, even with aggressive outreach or new program development.” Declining use of campus housing is also driving up per-student costs.

New Kensington has “struggled to maintain relevance and scale in an increasingly competitive higher education environment” around Pittsburgh, the report reads. The campus’ offerings mirror other locations and nearby Penn State Beaver will maintain Penn State’s presence in the area.

For Shenango, declining populations and economic challenges in the surrounding region “fundamentally limit the potential for future enrollment stabilization.” Without more campus housing, Penn State could not bring more students to the campus, either.

Wilkes-Barre was recommended for closure because its campus is small and has limited housing, which makes it less appealing than nearby locations like Scranton and Hazleton. “There is no compelling academic niche or distinctive program portfolio at Penn State Wilkes-Barre that cannot be replicated or consolidated” at another campus or online.

Penn State York lacks the campus housing to attract non-commuter students. The nearby Harrisburg location has such housing and offers more diverse programming. Five other locations — Beaver, Greater Allegheny, Hazleton, Schuylkill, and Scranton — were considered but not recommended for closure. The university estimates closing the seven campuses would save around $50 million a year, along with clearing around $200 million in needed maintenance at the properties. The records do not offer an estimate of what it will cost to implement the plan.

The plan for employees, students Julio Palma, a Penn State Fayette professor, told Spotlight PA that shutting down a location is not innovation. Penn State is abandoning communities, like coal companies have done throughout Appalachia, he said. “This is a public university that receives funding from the state, it receives funding from taxpayers,” Palma said. “Those taxpayers are spread in every corner of the state. They are in Fayette. And while the taxpayers are supporting Penn State across the state, Penn State is closing doors, closing opportunities.” Penn State estimates that 520 full-time employees will be affected by the closures. Non-tenure-line faculty and staff could be rehired and could be given priority consideration for jobs at remaining campuses and University Park. “The largest expense will likely be severance costs for employees who are no longer employed by Penn State,” the recommendation says. No cost estimate is provided in the records, though the university expects to reduce such workforce expenses through attrition, retirements, and voluntary separations. More than 3,100 students were enrolled in the seven campuses in fall 2024, representing 3.6% of Penn State’s systemwide enrollment, according to university data. Other campuses could absorb these students without needing to hire additional staff, the university estimates. Affected students could receive additional financial aid, adjusted costs when attending another campus, or even gas cards, according to the proposal. These students will be offered “navigation coaches” who will help students clarify their goals, stay motivated, and find experts to answer their questions. Students at these campuses are not necessarily going to travel a greater distance to enroll at another campus, or they may not have the means, Andrea Adolph, a Penn State New Kensington professor, told Spotlight PA. The administration and trustees do not understand this reality, she said: “This is going to be an incredible blow to opportunities for students who can’t pick up and move somewhere else.” Penn State, in its recommendation, argues that fewer campuses will benefit students. “Treating all campuses the same would have meant continued subsidies to locations with little growth potential—ultimately disadvantaging students elsewhere across the commonwealth. With this recommendation, the University can focus on targeted investments where it can do the greatest good, particularly for first-generation, Pell-eligible, and underserved students.” Penn State will not accept new student applications for closed campuses after fall 2025. Will the plan pass? Trustees were expected to vote on Bendapudi’s proposal on Thursday but the volume of questions from board members, as well as consternation from some, have delayed the move. Thursday’s meeting will be a private executive session. The board also gathered Friday morning in private at University Park, during which they discussed the closure plan, according to a public statement by board Chair Kleppinger and people with knowledge of trustee discussions. In private, Kleppinger has told trustees the board should unanimously support Bendapudi’s proposal and that dissent could hurt her legacy, according to multiple sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private board dynamics. Kleppinger, in a statement to Spotlight PA, refuted that characterization and said: “Penn State’s board is specifically structured to include trustees from varying backgrounds and experiences to bring diverse viewpoints and opinions to University oversight matters, and there is absolutely room for every trustee to share their perspectives. The board asked President Bendapudi two years ago to look into the structure and health of the University’s Commonwealth Campus ecosystem. Significant work, over eighteen months has gone into the recommendation and my ask to the board is that we fully consider her recommendation and make a decision that is the best interest of the continued success of Penn State.” Last month, trustees Jay Paterno and Ted Brown, and later Nicholas Rowland, publicly questioned the administration’s approach to the decision and stated reasons in several op-eds in StateCollege.com. “Our campuses are not line items to cut or assets to liquidate; they are integral parts of the whole,” Rowland wrote. But several factors work in Bendapudi’s favor. The size of Penn State’s board — 36 voting members — requires a large number of trustees to vote against the measure to stop it. Also, trustees will take one vote on the proposal, not consider closures on a campus-by-campus basis. Finally, voting data shows that trustees are often loath to vote against an administration’s proposal. A previous Spotlight PA analysis of trustee votes between 2019 and 2024 found that they passed nearly 85% of measures without a single oppositional vote. The board voted down just four of the 328 measures it considered during this period, three of which were motions a trustee proposed mid-meeting. The other, in July, was an option for how trustees should be elected to the board. According to the board documents, trustees have questioned how the administration will implement the plan, the estimated costs and savings, and how Penn State could divest from the associated real estate. The records provide some insight into how Penn State’s governing body is thinking about the proposal given that, to date, the board has not held public discussions on the topic. The board previously planned a virtual-only meeting this week to vote on the plan, an act that legal experts previously told Spotlight PA could run afoul of Pennsylvania’s open meetings law. Someone could challenge the meeting in court, and if they were successful, a judge could potentially overturn the trustees’ votes, the lawyers told Spotlight PA. (Penn State did not respond to requests for comment at the time.) Consequences of a decision This spring, some members of the university community, including employees, called on Bendapudi to reconsider closing campuses. They felt the president’s reasons for weighing closures— at first financial and later about the student experience — lacked clarity and transparency. The vast majority of the more than 500 public comments Penn State received — from community members to alumni to lawmakers — asked the university to keep all locations open. Trustees received brief summaries of these comments. The recommendation documents note that some people said they supported closures but felt pressured to publicly say otherwise, though the report did not include further information about these claims. Opponents of campus closures did not offer any “fully developed or funded proposals,” the board’s documents say. Likewise, Bendapudi and her chief of staff, Michael Wade Smith, talked to Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro and state lawmakers, and “there have been no offers of financial support in these conversations,” the document reads. Shapiro’s office did not return a request for comment for this story. According to the internal documents, Penn State does not anticipate political or reputational fallout from the decision, nor does it think the hundreds of millions of dollars it receives each year in taxpayer funds, now under consideration, are in jeopardy. “We do not expect this decision to have long-term negative implications on the Penn State brand,” the documents read. “… We can expect short-term dissatisfaction within the local communities where campus closures will have an impact, which is likely to manifest in negative news coverage — local and regional.”","The reasons for closing campuses Under the proposal, the new Penn State will be regionalized to incentivize larger classes and on-campus living instead of commuting.

WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. health regulators announced an effort Tuesday to phase out ingestible fluoride supplements sometimes used to strengthen children’s teeth, opening a new front in Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s effort against a mainstay of dental care.

The Food and Drug Administration said it will conduct a scientific review of the children’s products by late October with the aim of removing them from the market. Formally withdrawing medical products requires a lengthy rulemaking process that can take years. Instead, the FDA will ask manufacturers to voluntarily pull their products, according to an administration official.

Fluoride tablets and lozenges are sometimes recommended for children and teens at increased risk of tooth decay or cavities because of low fluoride in their local drinking water. Companies also sell drops for babies.

FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said the products pose a risk when swallowed because they may interfere with healthy gut bacteria that are critical to digestion, immunity and other key bodily functions. He also referenced studies showing possible associations between excess fluoride intake and other problems, including decreased IQ.

The nation’s leading dental group said Tuesday the studies “do not in fact demonstrate any harmful effects” from fluoride at the levels used by dentists.

AP AUDIO: FDA and RFK Jr. aim to remove ingestible fluoride products used to protect kids’ teeth AP’s Lisa Dwyer reports on new plans to phase out the use of fluoride tablets.

“Proposals like this stand to hurt rural America, not make them healthier,” American Dental Association President Dr. Brett Kessler said. “More than ever, at this critical time in American health care policy, it is vital that we slow down to properly study the full implications of actions like this on the health of the nation.”

Officials in Utah — the first U.S. state to ban fluoride from drinking water — recently made fluoride supplements available without a prescription. As more state and local governments begin removing fluoride from their water, the need for supplemental fluoride is expected to grow.

Fluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 1962, the agency set guidelines for how much should be added to water.

Kennedy, a former environmental lawyer, has called fluoride a “dangerous neurotoxin” tied to a range of health dangers. Last month, he announced a task force to scrutinize fluoride’s use, while at the same time saying he would order the CDC to stop recommending that it be added to tap water.

A report last year by the federal government’s National Toxicology Program concluded that drinking water with more than twice the CDC’s recommended level was associated with lower IQs in kids. The study was based on research conducted in Canada, China, India, Iran, Pakistan and Mexico.

“Ending the use of ingestible fluoride is long overdue,” Kennedy said in a statement Tuesday. “This decision brings us one step closer to delivering on President Trump’s promise to Make America Healthy Again.”

An influential government health panel recommends fluoride supplements for children between the ages of six months and 5 years if they live in areas with low fluoridation levels. The U.S. Preventative Services Task Forces judged the recommendation to have “high certainty,” based on the available evidence.

A 2010 paper from the ADA recommended supplemental fluoride for children up to 16 years old who are at high risk of cavities. The recommendation was based on a review of studies across different age groups. The most common side effect associated with the products is spotting or discoloration of the teeth, caused by extra fluoride.

ADA’s Kessler said the FDA’s plan “will be particularly harmful to the most vulnerable and those who lack access to care.”

The FDA regulates most dental products, including fluoride-containing toothpastes, supplements, mouthwashes and rinses. But in Tuesday’s press release, the FDA said the ingestible products targeted by the agency have “never been approved.” The agency’s plan wouldn’t affect toothpastes, mouthwash or fluoride treatments used by adults or those offered in dentists’ offices.

In recent weeks fluoride-containing products have increasingly been targeted with lawsuits and legal actions.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced an investigation early this month into the marketing of fluoride toothpastes by Colgate-Palmolive and Proctor and Gamble. A press release from his office described the companies’ promotions as “misleading, deceptive and dangerous.”

AP AUDIO: FDA and RFK Jr. aim to remove ingestible fluoride products used to protect kids’ teeth AP’s Lisa Dwyer reports on new plans to phase out the use of fluoride tablets.
As more state and local governments begin removing fluoride from their water, the need for supplemental fluoride is expected to grow.
“Ending the use of ingestible fluoride is long overdue,” Kennedy said in a statement Tuesday.
The most common side effect associated with the products is spotting or discoloration of the teeth, caused by extra fluoride.","['products', 'fda', 'teeth', 'dental', 'kids', 'health', 'used', 'water', 'rfk', 'supplements', 'remove', 'fluoride', 'jr', 'ingestible', 'protect']",Mexico,Texas,Washington,United States,Regulatory action on ingestible fluoride supplements,negative,"The article discusses the FDA's initiative to phase out ingestible fluoride supplements for children due to potential health risks, sparking controversy and opposition from dental professionals and stakeholders.

2025-05-13 23:27:02,2025-05-14 07:27:02 +08,https://apnews.com/article/climbing-deaths-north-cascades-national-park-washington-d547355a0dabfccb2175e14246536c31,Three climbers fell 400 feet to their death. One climber survived and drove to a pay phone,"A rock climber who fell hundreds of feet descending a steep gully in Washington’s North Cascades mountains survived the fall that killed his three companions, hiked to his car in the dark and then drove to a pay phone to call for help, authorities said Tuesday.

The surviving climber, Anton Tselykh, 38, extricated himself from a tangle of ropes, helmets and other equipment after the fall Saturday evening. Despite suffering internal bleeding and head trauma, Tselykh eventually, over at least a dozen hours, made the trek to the pay phone, Okanogan County Undersheriff Dave Yarnell said.

The climbers who were killed were Vishnu Irigireddy, 48, Tim Nguyen, 63, Oleksander Martynenko, 36, Okanogan County Coroner Dave Rodriguez said.

Authorities haven’t yet been able to interview the survivor, who is in a Seattle hospital, said Rodriguez, so much is still unknown of the fall and Tselykh’s journey.

Falls like this leading to three deaths are extremely rare, said Cristina Woodworth, who leads the sheriff’s search and rescue team. Seven years ago, two climbers were killed in a fall on El Capitan at Yosemite National Park in California.

The group of four were scaling the Early Winters Spires, jagged peaks split by a cleft that is popular with climbers in the North Cascade Range, about 160 miles (257 kilometers) northeast of Seattle. Tselykh was hospitalized in Seattle.

The group of four met with disaster that night when the anchor used to secure their ropes was torn from the rock while they were descending, Rodriguez said. The anchor they were using, a metal spike called a piton, appeared to have been placed there by past climbers, he said.

They plummeted for about 200 feet (60 meters) into a slanted gulch and then tumbled another 200 feet before coming to rest, Yarnell said. Authorities believe the group had been ascending but turned around when they saw a storm approaching.

A three-person search and rescue team reached the site of the fall Sunday, Woodworth said. The team used coordinates from a device the climbers had been carrying, which had been shared by a friend of the men.

Once they found the site, they called in a helicopter to remove the bodies one at a time because of the rough terrain, Woodworth said.

On Monday, responders poured over the recovered equipment trying to decipher what caused the fall, Woodworth said. They found a piton — basically a small metal spike that is driven into rock cracks or ice and used as anchors by climbers — that was still clipped into the climbers’ ropes.

“There’s no other reason it would be hooked onto the rope unless it pulled out of the rock,” said Rodriguez, the coroner, noting that pitons are typically stuck fast in the rock. Rodriguez added that when rappelling, all four men would not have be hanging from the one piton at the same time, but taking turns moving down the mountain.

Pitons are oftentimes left in walls. They can be there for years or even decades, and they may become less secure over time.

“It looked old and weathered, and the rest of their equipment looked newer, so we are making the assumption that it was an old piton,” Woodworth said.

Rock climbers secure themselves by ropes to anchors, such as pitons or other climbing equipment. The ropes are intended to arrest their fall if they should slip, and typically climbers use backup anchors, said Joshua Cole, a guide and co-owner of North Cascades Mountain Guides, who has been climbing in the area for about 20 years.

Generally, it would be unusual to rappel off a single piton, said Cole, adding that it is still unknown exactly what happened on the wall that night.

“We eventually, if possible, would like to get more information from surviving party,” Woodworth said.

The spires are a popular climbing spot. The route the climbers were taking, said Cole, was of moderate difficulty, and requires moving between ice, snow and rock.

But the conditions, the amount of ice versus rock for example, can change rapidly with the weather, he said, even week to week or day to day, changing the route’s risks.

The drinking water rules were adopted as part of the Biden administration’s efforts to limit public exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), hazardous chemicals linked to range of serious illnesses. The original rule covered six common PFAS contaminants, including PFOA, a known human carcinogen, and PFOS, a likely carcinogen.

The EPA estimates that more than 158 million Americans are exposed to PFAS through their drinking water.

The agency plans to maintain current rules for PFOA and PFOS, though it will extend the deadline for compliance from 2029 to 2031.

In the documents reviewed by The Post, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said that the changes will “protect Americans from PFOA and PFOS in their drinking water” while providing “common-sense flexibility in the form of additional time for compliance.”

The EPA did not respond to a request for comment.

The agency’s action follows the release by the White House in March of a 36-page “National Strategy to End the Use of Paper Straws” that detailed the dangers of PFAS, saying the chemicals “are harmful to human health, and they have been linked to harms affecting reproductive health, developmental delays in children, cancer, hormone imbalance.”

PFAS are a large class of persistent chemicals used to make a wide array of consumer and industrial products that repel grease, water, oil and heat. Scientists have found them in the blood of almost every American and have detected the compounds in remote regions of the planet, such as Antarctica.

The regulations gave the 66,000 public water systems in the United States until 2029 to comply with the new standards. Under the rule, the maximum contamination level for PFOA and PFOS was set at 4 parts per trillion. Three other compounds — PFHxS, PFNA and GenX — were limited to 10 parts per trillion. In addition, the water standard required utilities to use a “hazard index” to monitor a mixture of the chemicals, as well as a fourth, PFBS.

In June, trade associations representing water utilities filed suit against the EPA, challenging the science and data underlying the drinking water standard and its timetable for meeting it. According to the agency’s estimates, the standard would cost utilities about $1.5 billion a year.

Under the agency’s new plan, according to the documents reviewed by The Post, the regulations covering PFHxS, PFNA, GenX, and PFBS will be rescinded and reconsidered. The agency plans to begin a new rulemaking process in the fall and to issue the new rule next spring. The agency also plans to start a program called PFAS OUT to “share resources, tools, funding and technical assistance to help utilities meet the federal drinking water standards.”

Erik Olson, the senior strategic director for health at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an advocacy group that is a party to the lawsuit, said the Safe Drinking Water Act’s “anti-backsliding” provision bars the agency from repealing or weakening the drinking water standard.

“The law is very clear that the EPA can’t repeal or weaken the drinking water standard. Any effort to do so will clearly violate what Congress has required for decades,” Olson said. “It shows that this administration doesn’t really care about protecting people’s drinking water from toxic forever chemicals that endanger the health of over 100 million Americans.”

The American Water Works Association, a trade group that sued the EPA over the PFAS rule, did not provide a comment, saying it would wait until the official EPA announcement before considering a response.

Linda Birnbaum, the former director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, said the agency’s decision to remove restrictions on the known substitutions for PFOS and PFOA was concerning.

“It’s too bad. We know these chemicals are dangerous. We know their adverse health effects. The more we study them, the more problems we face,” Birnbaum said. “If anything, the science is stronger today that it was a year or two years ago.”

GenX has been linked to kidney and liver toxicity, immune and development effects and cancer in rats, according to an EPA toxicity assessment.

Emily Donovan, who lives near Wilmington, North Carolina, an area affected by the release of GenX into the Cape Fear River, said that communities will bear the brunt of the EPA’s decision.","The Environmental Protection Agency plans to rescind and reconsider limits on four different “forever chemicals” under a landmark drinking water standard implemented last year by President Joe Biden, according to documents reviewed by The Washington Post.

Karen Read’s murder trial will not be in session Tuesday due to “unavoidable circumstances,” according to a court spokesperson.

The alert was sent to media outlets shortly before the day’s testimony was slated to begin at 9 a.m. The spokesperson gave no further details, and the Norfolk Superior Court clerk’s office and security were unable to provide any explanation.

A court official later confirmed Tuesday’s testimony was canceled due to health reasons and said a brief closed-door hearing held around 11 a.m. concerned scheduling. Prosecutors and members of the O’Keefe family could be seen talking outside the courthouse Tuesday morning.

Read’s trial entered its fourth week Monday. Jurors began the week with a third and final full day of testimony from Massachusetts State Police Sgt. Yuriy Bukhenik, one of the troopers who investigated the death of Read’s boyfriend, Boston Police Officer John O’Keefe.

Read, 45, is accused of drunkenly and intentionally ramming O’Keefe with her SUV while dropping him off at an afterparty in Canton early on Jan. 29, 2022. While prosecutors allege she left O’Keefe to die in a blizzard, Read’s lawyers have suggested O’Keefe was attacked after entering the home. They contend Read was framed in a vast conspiracy among law enforcement and afterparty guests.

Taking the stand Monday, Bukhenik faced intense questioning about one guest in particular: federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives agent Brian Higgins. Read’s lawyers have sought to implicate Higgins in their third-party culprit defense, suggesting he had motive to harm O’Keefe after sharing flirty texts — and a kiss — with Read while she was in her relationship with O’Keefe.

However, Bukhenik testified Monday he found no evidence pointing to any animosity between O’Keefe and Higgins or homeowner Brian Albert.

The ongoing trial is Read’s second, after jurors in her first trial returned deadlocked last summer.

Opponents of the proposal were stunned at its sweeping implications. While it is in line with President Trump’s agenda, it had been considered somewhat of a long shot to make it out of the House Ways and Means Committee, because of its cost.

The program is structured as a $5 billion tax credit, allowing donors to reduce their tax bill by $1 for every $1 they give to nonprofits that grant scholarships — up to 10 percent of the donor’s income.

The option to donate is expected to be popular with wealthy taxpayers.

The resulting scholarships could be worth $5,000 per child, reaching one million students. Any family who earns less than 300 percent of their area’s median income — which equals over $300,000 in some parts of the country — could use the funds, meaning a vast majority of families would be eligible.

The proposal could pass through the budget reconciliation process, and could become law with only 51 votes in a Senate where Republicans hold 53 seats.","Opponents of the proposal were stunned at its sweeping implications.

Meink, who previously served as deputy director of the National Reconnaissance Office, will now take charge of the Air Force and Space Force. He has a deep background in acquisition and technology development specializing in space and also served as NRO’s director of signals intelligence systems acquisition.

His career at the Air Force has included service as deputy undersecretary of the Air Force for space and, while at the Air Force Research Laboratory in New Mexico, stints as a program manager, senior research engineer and chief technical adviser. He served in the Air Force beginning in 1988 as a navigator on the KC-135 Stratotanker.

Meink will take over the Department of the Air Force at a time of significant transformation, as virtually all major portions of its aircraft fleet are in the process of modernizing. That includes overseeing the service’s planned sixth-generation fighter, dubbed the F-47, as prime contractor Boeing begins the complicated process of developing and then delivering a complex, advanced aircraft without breaking the bank.

The Air Force is also developing multiple versions of semiautonomous drone wingmen, known as collaborative combat aircraft, that will fly alongside the F-47, the F-35A Joint Strike Fighter and potentially other aircraft.

The service is in the midst of a major revamp of its bomber force as it brings on the Northrop Grumman B-21 Raider stealth bomber to replace the retiring B-1 and B-2 bombers. The Air Force eventually plans to have a two-bomber fleet made up of the B-21, alongside heavily revamped B-52J Stratofortresses.

And the Air Force is worried about its LGM-35A Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile. That program, which is to be built by Northrop Grumman, is planned to succeed the aging Minuteman III nuclear missile program, but higher-than-expected construction costs have forced the service to rethink its approach to Sentinel.

Meink’s acquisition background could help the service manage these multiple programs. His space expertise could also benefit the Space Force, whose missions are expanding and which has sought to grow its budget to handle them.

In his nomination hearing in March, Meink pledged to push for the Space Force to get the resources it needs, given the growing role it will likely play in future military actions.

“Space is going to be one of the determining factors” in a future conflict, Meink said. “We definitely need to get that right.”

But Meink’s relationship with SpaceX founder and Trump administration adviser Elon Musk created controversy. Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Tammy Duckworth of Illinois in February raised concerns about what they termed a “potential quid pro quo” between Meink and Musk, after reports surfaced that Meink had favored SpaceX for a contract while running NRO.

“These are incredibly serious allegations of misconduct and favoritism,” they wrote in a letter to Meink. “These reports raise concerns about your ability, if confirmed as secretary, to treat contractors fairly and prioritize the Air Force’s mission over Elon Musk’s business interests.”

According to a Politico report, Meink disclosed to lawmakers in written responses that Musk was present for his interview with Trump, but said several other people were also present and Musk did not ask any questions. Musk’s presence at the interview raised eyebrows among some ethics experts, who called it unusual.

Meink denied having a relationship with Musk or SpaceX beyond executing his duties as head of NRO, and said he did not ask for Musk to support him to be Air Force secretary, nor did Musk ask him for anything.

Pushing back on Trump’s designation of Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche as acting librarian, lawmakers said Tuesday that control of the institution remains with its top career official, Robert R. Newlen. Newlen told staff at the library that he is the acting head, according to an email obtained by The Washington Post.

The president installed Blanche — a close Trump ally and his former defense attorney — as the acting head of the library just days after he abruptly fired Carla Hayden, the first woman and African American to serve as librarian of Congress, on Friday, nine years into her 10-year term.

The White House has not publicly announced Blanche’s new role, but a Justice Department official confirmed it, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive personnel matters.

The Library of Congress declined to comment. The White House press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

On Capitol Hill, Democrats said Tuesday they did not believe that Blanche was the acting librarian — and Republicans, who have repeatedly deferred to Trump even as he has wrested control of federal spending from authorities, indicated that they wanted to maintain their power around the library, which is part of the legislative branch even though the president nominates its leader.

“We made it clear that there needs to be a consultation around this — that there are equities that both Article I and Article II branches have [with] the Library of Congress,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-South Dakota) told reporters Tuesday, referring to the legislative and executive branches, adding that Trump administration officials had met with members of the Senate Rules and Administration Committee, which oversees the library.

Advertisement

Still, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-New York) attacked Republicans as “a compliant rubber stamp” for Trump’s agenda and said Democrats would “look into” the president’s firing of Hayden. He hinted at possible litigation.

“It’s the Library of Congress, not the library of the executive branch,” Jeffries told reporters. “This is an example of executive overreach.”

Sen. Alex Padilla (California), the top Democrat on the Rules Committee, said administration officials understood that the institution remains under the control of Newlen, not Blanche.

“For the time being, the acting librarian is the acting librarian,” Padilla said in an interview Tuesday. “The folks that President Trump is trying to put in place seem to be respecting that, and we continue to talk to our Republican colleagues on defending the legislative branch.”

Padilla met Tuesday afternoon with Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky), the chair of the Rules Committee, to discuss a bipartisan response to the administration’s move.

McConnell’s aides declined to comment on the meeting and did not address the nature of the standoff.

Newlen told library staffers Monday that he was waiting to hear from Congress about the next steps in the leadership transition, but he referred to himself as the acting head.

“You may have read that the White House has named a new acting Librarian,” Newlen wrote, according to a copy of one email obtained by The Post. “Currently Congress is engaged with the White House, and we have not yet received direction from Congress on how to move forward. We will share additional information as we receive it.”

The issue is simmering inside the Democratic caucus, where senators discussed the matter during their weekly policy luncheon Tuesday.

Padilla said some senators raised concern about potential abuse by the administration, including worries about the copyright office that the library controls, but the overarching issue was about defending an institution controlled by Congress from a hostile takeover by the president.

“This is the Library of Congress, not the library of the president,” he said, explaining his remarks to his colleagues during the closed-door meeting. “To be clear, this is not a Democrat versus Republican thing. This is a separation-of-powers, co-equal-branches-of-government discussion.”","Newlen told staff at the library that he is the acting head, according to an email obtained by The Washington Post.

The girl -– one of three U.S.-born children who were deported alongside their Honduran-born mothers -– had been at the heart of one of the mounting legal battles playing out in the United States weighing if the Trump administration broke the law in implementing its new deportation policies.

“Given the traumatizing experiences the families have been through, they are taking a step back to have full discussions about all their options, the safety and well-being of their children, and the best ways to proceed so the harms they have suffered can be fully addressed,” said Gracie Willis, one of the family’s lawyers.

The lawsuit was brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, National Immigration Project and several other allied groups, which said the deportations were a “shocking — although increasingly common — abuse of power.”

Willis and the group of lawyers had argued that the families did not have a fair opportunity to decide whether they wanted the children to stay in the United States. Willis said the family of the 2-year-old girl and their lawyers jointly decided to dismiss the case to give the family “space and time to consider all the options that are available to them.”

A federal judge in Louisiana had raised questions about the girl’s deportation, saying the government did not prove it had done so properly.

The Honduran-born mother — who is pregnant — was arrested in April on an outstanding deportation order along with the girl and her 11-year-old Honduran-born sister during a check-in appointment at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in New Orleans, lawyers said. The family lived in Baton Rouge.

Lawyers for the girl’s father insisted he wanted the girl to remain with him in the U.S., while ICE said the mother had wanted the girl to be deported with her to Honduras.

In a court filing, lawyers for the father said ICE indicated that it was holding the girl in a bid to induce the father to turn himself in.

U.S. District Judge Terry Doughty in Louisiana had scheduled a hearing for the case later this week, saying it was “in the interest of dispelling our strong suspicion that the Government just deported a U.S. citizen with no meaningful process.”

The girl -– one of three U.S.-born children who were deported alongside their Honduran-born mothers -– had been at the heart of one of the mounting legal battles playing out in the United States weighing if the Trump administration broke the law in implementing its new deportation policies.
The family lived in Baton Rouge.
Lawyers for the girl’s father insisted he wanted the girl to remain with him in the U.S., while ICE said the mother had wanted the girl to be deported with her to Honduras.
In a court filing, lawyers for the father said ICE indicated that it was holding the girl in a bid to induce the father to turn himself in.","['administration', 'deported', '2yearold', 'family', 'girl', 'children', 'lawsuit', 'mother', 'father', 'deportation', 'wanted', 'trump', 'honduranborn', 'drops', 'citizen', 'honduras', 'lawyers']",MEXICO,Louisiana,New Orleans,Honduras,Deportation of US citizen children,negative,"The article details the forced deportation of a 2-year-old US citizen and her family, legal challenges against the US government, and references to trauma and alleged abuse of power, indicating a negative sentiment and a specific event of US citizen children being deported.",15.2572432,-86.0755145

A federal judge on Tuesday seized control of New York City's notorious jail complex on Rikers Island, which will now be run by an official who reports directly to the court.

In a 77-page ruling, Judge Laura Taylor Swain wrote that she found the conduct of the city over the last nine years ""leaves no doubt that continued insistence on compliance with the court's orders by persons answerable principally to political authorities would lead only to confrontation and delay.""

She also wrote ""that the current management structure and staffing are insufficient to turn the tide within a reasonable period; that defendants have consistently fallen short of the requisite compliance with court orders for years, at times under circumstances that suggest bad faith; and that enormous resources -- that the city devotes to a system that is at the same time overstaffed and underserved -- are not being deployed effectively.""

The manager, who will report to the judge, will work with the city's jails commissioner and will be ""empowered to take all actions necessary"" to fix the complex.

""While the necessary changes will take some time, the court expects to see continual progress toward these goals,"" the judge wrote.

Critics have described brutal, violent and inhumane conditions inside the jail for years.

New York Mayor Eric Adams addressed the ruling during a news conference at city hall on Tuesday, saying that Rikers' problems were ""decades in the making."" He claimed that the legal requirement that the jail close in 2027 limited his administration's ability to address them.

""It stated you can't make any capital improvements on Rikers Island,"" Adams said. ""We can't spend money on Rikers Island to improve the conditions.""

Mayoral candidate Scott Stringer, who previously served as the city's comptroller, praised the judge's ruling as ""long-overdue but necessary"" in a statement released on Tuesday.

""For decades, Rikers has represented a systemic failure of multiple mayoral administrations -- plagued by violence, neglect, and dangerous and inhumane conditions,"" he said. ""While I applaud this decision, I do not view it as a victory; instead, it is a scathing indictment of our city’s failed leadership.""","A views of the New York City jails on Rikers Island, Dec. 10, 2022 in Queens, New York.

The police bombing of the home of the Move organization on 13 May 1985 was one of the worst atrocities carried out during the era of the 1970s and 1980s Black liberation struggle. It followed a prolonged siege in which the notoriously brutal Philadelphia police attempted to drive the group out of its premises at 6221 Osage Avenue.

Officers pummeled the house with more than 10,000 rounds of ammunition over a 90-minute period, even though children were known to be inside. When that failed to dislodge the Move activists, authorities ordered a police helicopter to drop an incendiary bomb made from C4 plastic explosives on to the roof of the house.

A fire was ignited and allowed to rage, killing all 11 people and turning to cinder 61 houses in the mainly Black neighborhood. About 250 people were left homeless.

Five children aged seven to 13 died in the inferno. They were named Tree, Netta, Deleisha, Little Phil and Tomasa.

Jamie Gauthier, a Philadelphia city council member who represents the area in which the bombing occurred, called the event “the darkest day in our city’s modern history”. Her motion calling for the 40th anniversary of the bombing to be marked with an official day of remembrance was adopted by the council last week.

“The story about the Move bombing is still being written, it is up to us to decide its ending,” Gauthier said. “If we take the easy way out and let this tragedy fade from memory, we doom ourselves to a future where those who come after us repeat the mistakes Philly’s leaders made 40 years ago.”

She added: “We must keep the infamy of the Move bombing alive and fight for reconciliation and justice so that none of our constituents hear the whistle of a bomb being dropped on their home ever again.”

Despite the devastation caused by the bombing, no Philadelphia official was ever criminally prosecuted for it. It took 35 years for the city to apologise for the violence it had inflicted on its own citizens.

On the 35th anniversary of the bombing, Wilson Goode, Philadelphia’s first Black mayor who accepted responsibility for the attack, expressed his desire for a formal apology in an article in the Guardian, saying: “Many in the city still feel the pain of that day – I know I will always feel the pain.”

Tuesday’s commemoration of the events that day is scheduled to be held at 6221 Osage Avenue – at 5.27pm, the precise moment the bomb was dropped. Mike Africa Jr, whose uncle and cousin both died in the bombing, has bought the now rebuilt house and plans to convert it into a memorial of the bombing.

He told the Guardian that the bombing, which occurred when he was six years old, was a “timestamp on our minds. It never goes away – you think of it every day. It’s haunting to know that your family was killed in such a brutal, senseless way.”

Africa Jr said that the bombing was a scar that would never heal. “The only thing we can do is keep moving forward and try to prevent this from happening again,” he said.","It followed a prolonged siege in which the notoriously brutal Philadelphia police attempted to drive the group out of its premises at 6221 Osage Avenue.

Hasan Piker, who has 2.8 million followers on Twitch, recounted his experience online Monday saying he was questioned for hours a day earlier despite being born in the U.S. and enrolled in Global Entry, a federal program allowing low-risk passengers to travel through customs and passport control quickly.

Piker believes he was targeted because of his views and said Customs and Border Protection officers asked his opinion of Trump and Hamas, among other topics. The liberal political commentator is frequently critical of Israel and the war in Gaza.

“The goal here is to put fear into people’s hearts, to have a chilling effect on speech,” Piker recounted in a detailed nearly 40-minute long account on his YouTube channel. “The government is now officially willing and able to intimidate you for your speech. That is a direct violation of the First Amendment.”

Piker did not have comment Tuesday beyond his Twitch stream a day earlier, according to a spokesman. The hours-long broadcast on the live streaming platform included the same account posted on YouTube along with Piker’s commentary on other topics and his speaking engagement at the University of Chicago.

Federal officials dismissed Piker’s account of the detention on Tuesday, calling the questioning “routine and lawful” and something that can apply to any traveler.

“This is nothing but lying for likes. Claims that his political beliefs triggered the inspection are baseless,” Tricia McLaughlin, U.S. Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary, said in a statement. “Once his inspection was complete, he was promptly released.”

The Trump administration’s aggressive crackdown on immigration and student protests have also increased worries among U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents navigating the last steps to citizenship. Recent immigration arrests have mistakenly swept up U.S. citizens in Illinois,Florida and other places.

Trump has deemed the pro-Palestinian campus protests as “anti-American” while critics say student arrests are part of an unprecedented attack on the freedom of speech. Last month a Palestinian man who led protests against the war in Gaza as a student was arrested during what he thought was an interview about his citizenship.

Federal officials declined to give further details about Piker’s detention, including what prompted the extensive questioning.

Piker, also known as HasanAbi on Twitch, was born in New Jersey. The 33-year-old was raised in Turkey. He lives in Los Angeles.

“I’m not intimidated,” he said on YouTube, where he has 1.6 million subscribers. “I’m going to keep doing what I’m doing.”","CHICAGO (AP) — A popular Turkish American online streamer who is critical of President Donald Trump was recently detained and questioned at O’Hare International Airport after his flight from Paris landed in Chicago.

Many people across the United States are rushing to replace their driver’s licenses and state IDs with federally compliant licences, known as Real ID cards, now required to board domestic flights.

As of May 7, all US citizens more than 18 years of age must show proof of identification that meets the 2005 Real ID Act’s rules, which set higher federal security standards. But this change in federal travel requirements is creating some confusion about what it means for noncitizens.

Passed two decades ago by Congress in response to the bipartisan 9/11 Commission’s recommendations following the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York, Pennsylvania and Washington, DC, the aim of the programme was to raise security standards for domestic travel and federal and nuclear facility access.

But immigration experts say the law’s enactment during the second Trump administration has left noncitizens – including some of the 13.5 million people legally in the US on green cards, work and student visas and humanitarian parole – uncertain about what the rule change could mean for their travel.

US President Donald Trump has promised and prioritised mass deportations of criminals and undocumented people in the US. But in practice, his policies have swept up US citizens and people with a legal immigration status. He has also tried to end legal pathways that allowed people to temporarily live and work in the US. Many of these actions are being challenged in court.

Here are some answers to commonly asked questions about Real ID and its effect on citizen versus noncitizen travel.

What is special about Real ID?

The Department of Homeland Security says the aim of the Real ID requirements was to bring consistency to the minimum documentation requirements needed for state-issued IDs – driver’s license, learner’s permits and nondriver IDs.

Now, all states issuing Real ID-compliant cards require people applying for those cards to present certain documentation. The exact requirements vary by state, but in most cases, the minimum documents needed include:

Proof of identity in the form of a US birth certificate, US passport, or a green card.

Social Security Number in the form of a Social Security card, W-2 form, or a pay stub.

Two proofs of address of principal residence, which may be a utility bill, bank statement or mortgage statement.

Lawful status proof, including a valid employment authorisation document, Social Security Number or a valid unexpired visa.

A Real ID card bears a black or gold star or a US flag in its upper right corner. State-issued ID cards that don’t have these markers will not be accepted as proof of identity to board domestic flights or enter federal facilities.

Here are some examples of what Real IDs look like:

Examples of Real ID-compliant driver’s licenses posted on the Department of Homeland Security’s website.

If I don’t have a Real ID, does it mean I cannot travel domestically any more?

No, you can still travel domestically provided you have another form of identification that is Real ID-compliant.

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) lists many other forms of acceptable IDs, including options for people who are not US citizens. Among them:

State-issued enhanced driver’s licenses or enhanced IDs, which provide proof of identity when crossing the US borders in a vehicle.

US passports or US passport cards.

Foreign government-issued passports.

Department of Homeland Security trusted traveller cards under programmes such as Global Entry, which let US citizens, green card holders and some foreign nationals go through expedited lanes at airports.

US Department of Defense IDs, including IDs issued to dependents of people in the military.

Lawful permanent resident cards, also known as green cards.

Border crossing cards, a document used by Mexican citizens to enter the US.

Acceptable photo IDs issued by federally recognised tribal nations, including enhanced tribal cards.

HSPD-12 PIV cards, which are used by federal contractors to access facilities and systems.

Canadian provincial driver’s license or Indian and Northern Affairs Canada cards.

Transportation Worker Identification Credentials (TWIC).

US Citizenship and Immigration Services Employment Authorization Cards.

US Merchant Mariner Credentials, which show evidence of a mariner’s qualifications; and

Veteran Health Identification Cards (VHIC).

There’s one big caveat: TSA says the list of acceptable IDs is subject to change without notice and advises travellers to check the list before travelling.

How could Real ID affect noncitizens as they travel in the US?

Although numerous forms of IDs are accepted for noncitizens, the Real ID policy could have a chilling effect on travelers whose documentation differentiates them from citizens, immigration experts told us.

As one example, immigration attorney Prerna Lal said that, in any interaction with federal authorities, carrying a foreign passport could lead to scrutiny of that person’s identity if they lack legal immigration status.

“Even with valid foreign passports, undocumented individuals and mixed-status families may avoid travelling due to concerns about interactions with TSA or law enforcement, despite passports remaining acceptable documentation,” Lal said. “This fear of enforcement, rather than access to IDs, is the primary chilling effect on the immigrant community.”

What happens if people don’t have an acceptable ID at the airport?

A TSA officer may ask a person to complete an identity verification process. If the identity is confirmed, that person will be allowed to enter the screening checkpoint.

Can an immigrant with temporary status obtain a Real ID?

Yes, the Real ID regulations define an individual in a “temporary lawful status” as a person who has a pending application for asylum; has a pending or approved application for temporary protected status; has approved deferred action; or has a pending application for lawful permanent resident or conditional permanent resident status.

The Real ID Act lets states issue temporary, Real ID driver licenses and ID cards to people with temporary status. People with a temporary immigration status are usually granted temporary valid employment authorisation and Social Security numbers, which they can use to apply for Real IDs. Their temporary Real ID will remain valid until their lawful status expires. Florida is one exception: The Sunshine State requires almost all immigrants with lawful status to renew their IDs annually. Green card holders in Florida don’t have to renew a REAL ID every year; their Real ID is valid until their green card expires. Most green cards are valid for 10 years, but people can apply for a renewal.

Also, people with valid student or work visas can present their unexpired passports, visas and I-94 forms – documents that show a person’s authorised period of stay in the US – for proof of identity and legal status and get a Real ID.

States that provide non-Real ID compliant ID cards to people without legal immigration status can still do so, according to DHS, but the cards must clearly state that they are not acceptable for Real ID purposes and must have a unique design or colour to differentiate them from compliant cards. These non-Real ID-compliant ID cards cannot be used as a form of identification for domestic travel.

Could a Real ID prevent an arrest by immigration authorities? Does it confirm that a person is legally in the US?

Lal told PolitiFact that a Real ID alone does not prevent a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s arrest or confirm a lawful immigration status. Although Real ID-compliant identification requires proof of lawful presence for issuance, it is not proof of current immigration status.

“ICE conducts its own verification, and possessing a Real ID does not grant immunity from enforcement actions,” Prerna said.

Prerna said that people should present to ICE valid, government-issued documentation that shows their current immigration status, such as a green card, employment authorisation card or visa.","Here are some answers to commonly asked questions about Real ID and its effect on citizen versus noncitizen travel.

Trump signed the order, “Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship,” on the first day of his second term, but it has since been halted by nationwide injunctions issued by three separate federal district courts.

The Supreme Court is taking up the issue after the Trump administration filed emergency appeals asking the justices to narrow the injunction orders so the policy could move forward in some capacity while the issue is battled out in courts around the country. Twenty-two states have sued over the ostensibly unconstitutional executive order, which seeks to end the practice of granting citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil.

Rolling Stone spoke with legal experts Christopher M. Lapinig and Christopher W. Schmidt about the significance of the Supreme Court’s decision to hear oral arguments, the merits of the cases challenging the order, and the broader impact of the Trump administration’s attack on the 14th Amendment.

Lapinig is an attorney with Asian Law Caucus, co-counsel alongside American Civil Liberties Union Foundation Immigrants’ Rights Project, State Democracy Defenders Fund, NAACP Legal Defense & Educational Fund, and others on New Hampshire Indonesian Community Support, et al v. Donald J. Trump, et al (this birthright citizenship case is separate from those the Supreme Court is convening over on May 15). Schmidt is a law professor and co-director of the Institute on the Supreme Court of the United States at Chicago Kent College of Law and a research professor at the American Bar Foundation.

It’s unclear exactly which questions the Supreme Court will take up on Thursday. But the oral arguments will likely have less to do with the constitutionality of birthright citizenship, and more to do with judicial authority and a contentious issue that has affected both parties in recent administrations: how lower courts can issue nationwide injunctions essentially inhibiting a president from instituting policies nationwide. The decision on that issue would not only impact these birthright citizenship cases, but the hundreds of other lawsuits challenging the Trump administration’s actions that are in the pipeline.

Editor’s picks

Here’s what else is at stake:

What Does the 14th Amendment Say About Birthright Citizenship?

The 14th Amendment, passed by Congress in 1866 and ratified in 1868, is pretty cut and dry regarding birthright citizenship: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.” It has long been widely interpreted that anyone born on U.S. soil is an American citizen, regardless of the citizenship of the child’s parents.

“It essentially was part of the efforts to make sure that slavery would not happen again, or anything resembling slavery would not happen again. And so the drafters of the 14th Amendment were abolitionists, right? They were anti-slavery, and they created this language with the idea of anti-subordination in mind,” Lapinig says. “And what that means is essentially that they wanted to make sure that no person in the United States would be subordinated or relegated to second-class citizens or something else by virtue of their race or their ethnicity or national origin.”

Drafters built “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” into the amendment’s language. Lapinig says they “contemplated that birthright citizenship should not extend to invaders, for example,” but that “it’s otherwise clear from the sort of discussions leading up to the enactment of the 14th Amendment that, of course, the 14th Amendment was to make sure that children of formerly enslaved people would be citizens by birth.” Related Content

“They also made clear,” he continues, “that they knew that, for example, children of immigrants from places like China or anywhere else would also be U.S. citizens by birth if they were born in the United States.”

What Is Trump’s Argument Regarding Birthright Citizenship?

The “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” line in the 14th Amendment is the key to the Trump administration’s argument.

“They are arguing that the categories of people that they are attempting to exclude are not subject to jurisdiction,” Schmidt says. “Their argument being that if you’re not legally in the country, [or] temporarily, you’re not, in some sense, subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. Now, even as I talk through that, it doesn’t seem to really resonate in any meaningful way when people think about why you’re subject to jurisdiction.”

“That was put in there to exclude people like someone born to a foreign diplomat who is subject to a different set of rules, even when they’re in the United States, perhaps also Native American populations who are not fully subject to the control of the United States. So, there were certain groups of people who were thought to fit in that category at the time.”

Both the text and the amendment’s history are not favorable to Trump’s argument.

“‘Subject to jurisdiction’ basically means, does the United States sovereign have control, or can it regulate you, like it can regulate other people? And whether you’re in the country legally or not, you’re subject to the sovereign authority of the United States, which is why [the jurisdiction argument] just doesn’t seem to make a lot of sense, just in terms of the language,” Schmidt says. “Also, for those people who studied immigration policy around the time of the 14th Amendment … the categories of ‘legal,’ ‘illegal,’ ‘documented,’ ‘undocumented’ — they were not categories that had much or any meaning at the time. The process by which someone would enter the country or leave the country was not nearly as regulated … And there wasn’t this sort of idea that there is a separate category of people who are undocumented or illegal immigrants.”

He adds: “This is a provision of the Constitution that has always struck me as being more clear than much of the Constitution.”

What Is the Precedent Against Trump’s Birthright Citizenship Executive Order?

Notably, beyond the text and history arguments when interpreting the Constitution against Trump’s executive order, there is also strong precedent against it with the Supreme Court’s ruling in United States v. Wong Kim Ark, in which the justices decided 6-2 in favor of Wong Kim Ark.

In the New Hampshire lawsuit, along with the other cases involving birthright citizenship, lawyers cite the 1898 case. Wong Kim Ark was a Chinese-American cook born in San Francisco in 1873. “His parents, who were from China, because of the Chinese Exclusion Act, were ineligible to be U.S. citizens,” Lapinig says.

Wong Kim Ark left the U.S. for China to see his family and his wife, whom he married on a previous trip (“Chinese immigration, especially Chinese women, were restricted” at the time, Lapinig says), but when he returned home to San Francisco, he was denied reentry by immigration officials on the claim that he was not a U.S. citizen, despite being born in San Francisco. He and his lawyers argued he was a U.S. citizen under the 14th Amendment. The case made it all the way to the Supreme Court, which sided with Wong Kim Ark. The ruling “enshrined the right to birthright citizenship for all babies, all children born in the United States to this day,” says Lapinig.

In addition to the pretty straightforward legal precedent against Trump’s executive order, Schmidt notes that it’s “just established practice” that birthright citizenship applies to anyone born in the U.S., even if their parents are undocumented, and that “Congress has been operating under the assumption this is the proper reading of the 14th Amendment for generations.”

Why Is the Supreme Court’s Decision to Hear Oral Arguments Significant Beyond the Constitutional Challenge?

The Supreme Court’s move to hear oral arguments is unusual because typically when the Supreme Court schedules oral arguments, it’s after granting certiorari, meaning the court has agreed to review a decision from a lower court. “The striking thing about the granting of oral arguments in the birthright citizenship cases is that they did not grant certiorari in any of the cases, nor did they identify a question presented that they’re going to be talking about,” Schmidt says.

There are a couple of topics that could be addressed on May 15. The first is the one Trump brought to the court: the validity of nationwide injunctions, which the district courts involved in the cases issued after deeming the executive order likely unconstitutional. “This is what the Trump administration went to the court saying: ‘We want you to lift these nationwide injunctions, because it’s an abuse of judicial authority,’” says Schmidt. “So, it’s highly likely that the court will want to hear some discussion simply about that problem, which certainly is sharply put into focus with this case, but it actually transcends this particular case. It’s just about the scope of district court authority on these national issues.”

The other topic is the substantive question of the lawsuits, which is unlikely to be discussed on Thursday as the administration only asked the court, so far, to narrow the nationwide injunctions. The question is a big one, though: “The constitutionality of a redefinition of birthright citizenship away from what’s been understood for over 100 years, to make it more narrowly applied, namely, at least according to the Trump executive order, to not apply to people who were born in the United States but to parents who are not in the United States with legal documentation or are only here temporarily,” Schmidt says.

Who Is the Target of the Executive Order?

Babies born after Feb. 19, 2025, to parents who do not have U.S. citizenship or permanent immigration status in the U.S. are the target of the executive order, should it stand. It is unclear how this would be enforced if the courts do ultimately allow it to stand.

“Anyone that is even on a visa that, in theory, could lead to a green card, like, say, an H-1B visa, which is a very common sort of skilled worker visa that is issued in the United States [would be vulnerable],” Lapinig says. “If at that point, they’re only put only on an H-1B and have not quite obtained legal permanent residents in the United States, then the executive order would consider their children, their babies, born to be ineligible for their birthright citizenship.”

Other visa holders, such as students, exchange visitors, tourists, athletes, and entertainers would also fall under this umbrella, as would Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) recipients, and people with humanitarian visas, among others.

Will the Supreme Court Weigh In or Let Lower Courts’ Decisions Stand and Effectively Rule the Executive Order Unconstitutional?

“This is the president of the United States declaring what at least takes the form of an authoritative interpretation of the Constitution. So simply the significance of who is making the claim and the significance of how much the claim would affect people does seem to indicate that allowing lower court decisions to do the work for the Supreme Court … it has always struck me as unlikely,” says Schmidt.

There is also likely a strategic reason the Supreme Court might want to take this case up. While the GOP-controlled court may give Trump some wins, like it did with the Trump immunity case last July, it’s likely “the court really wants to assert that it’s not just simply a rubber stamp for the Trump administration, and it wants to find opportunities to also assert its role in this whole process,” Schmidt says. “So therefore, it wants to find some Trump administration initiatives to strike down, and this has always struck me as easy pickings. The law is so clear, so well-established, and the impact of this on American society would be very disruptive, quite radical, quite harmful.”

“It is just head spinning, the amount of activity coming out of the executive branch that is constitutionally and legally questionable, and the burden that’s going to place on the courts,” Schmidt adds. “It’s a question about whether the courts are going to be spread so thin with these really major issues, and whether they want to be a little strategic about which cases they’re going to take on. … They might just allow the lower courts to take this one. I still don’t think that’s likely, but it is an option.”

Why It Matters.

Should Trump’s executive order be implemented as is, the policy would create an “underclass of individuals,” says Lapinig, which is something the drafters of the 14th Amendment worked to combat. “The 14th Amendment was truly an effort to make sure that slavery itself would not happen again in the United States, but also that nothing like slavery would happen again, as in that there would never be the creation and growth of an underclass of people in the United States that were denied off their race or ethnicity or ancestry, equal rights to others.”

“This executive order would create, dramatically, a large underclass of people in the United States that, in turn, would not be eligible for any public benefits, or [other] aspects of public support — and all Americans would be affected, because they are in your communities,” he adds. “The fabric of every community in the United States would be affected in some way because there would be the presence of folks who would unfortunately be part of this underclass of people. And so those communities would have to — whether on an individual level or on a community level — deal with the ramifications of children who are or who have been, who will be excluded from membership among the ranks of U.S. citizens.” Trending Stories Control, 'Freak-Offs,' Abuse: 7 Takeaways from Cassie's Testimony at Sean Combs Trial People Are Losing Loved Ones to AI-Fueled Spiritual Fantasies Halle Bailey Granted Restraining Order Against DDG, Claims He Abused Her Multiple Times 'Andor' Season 2 Finale: Finding the Cost of Freedom

As for the New Hampshire v. Trump lawsuit, which was filed hours after Trump signed the birthright citizenship executive order on his first day in office on Jan. 20, Judge Joseph Laplante issued a preliminary injunction on Feb. 10. On April 10, Trump and his administration filed a notice of appeal.

“We are very confident in our lawsuit, in the legal merits of our lawsuit, and our position that this executive order is completely and flagrantly unconstitutional,” Lapinig says. “We know that the law — has stood for as I mentioned over 120 years — is clearly on our side, and so we will just continue to litigate our lawsuit and do what we can to make sure that this executive order is never implemented.”","The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments over President Donald Trump’s executive order to end birthright citizenship on Thursday.

The fire is now contained to the original building, Baltimore City Fire Department spokesperson John Marsh said Tuesday, which is located near the intersection of Edmondson Avenue and North Bentalou Street.

There is still “deep-seated fire” in multiple locations, Marsh said, and around 50 firefighters continue to chase hot spots.

The cause of the fire has not yet been determined, and no injuries have been reported.

More than 225 firefighters responded to the seven-alarm fire Monday night at the multistory warehouse, which abuts train tracks used by MARC and Amtrak.

Light gray smoke still poured out of the building Tuesday morning as Baltimore City Fire Chief James Wallace and Mayor Brandon Scott stood near the scene.

The warehouse, Wallace said, is a “very large commercial structure,” with three to four stories above ground and two below. Firefighters have not been able to access the underground floors due to stability issues in the back of the building and near Amtrak, Wallace said.

Building engineers are working on a demolition plan.

“It’s going to take a lot of work,” Wallace said.

Wallace also said it has been years since the city has had a seven-alarm fire.

Video shared with WJZ showed flames spreading Monday night to nearby trees and thick, dark smoke obscuring the view of a red water tower on top of the warehouse. Aerial photos showed large plumes of smoke and crews working from multiple angles to hit the warehouse with water.

The fire started at the back right of the building, which is used to store mattresses. Wallace said Monday that the warehouse had two basement levels “stacked full” of mattresses.

About 30 nearby residents were asked to temporarily relocate because of concerns about smoke and radiant heat, and to give fire crews better access to the warehouse, though officials said it wasn’t an evacuation.

The American Red Cross of the National Capital & Greater Chesapeake Region is supporting residents who were asked to temporarily leave their homes in the 600 block of North Bentalou Street, a spokesperson said.

Several city agencies were involved in the response to this fire, Wallace said, with the Baltimore City Department of Transportation assisting with traffic and the MTA helping to bus residents to a nearby fire station.

Around 9:30 p.m., smoke was visible on Doppler radar, according to WJZ’s meteorologist Derek Beasley. The relatively light winds on Monday evening pushed the smoke plume north toward Druid Hill.

Beasley said the weather Monday evening likely worked in the fire crews’ favor, especially with rain in the forecast.

That’s a “huge difference” compared to what crews dealt with during the Camp Small fire at the end of 2024, where high winds fanned the flames of an inferno.

The Maryland Department of the Environment advised people to avoid the area and to leave or move indoors if they feel affected by the smoke.

The Maryland Transit Administration said service on the MARC Penn Line is canceled on Tuesday morning.

Amtrak train service between Wilmington, Delaware, and Washington, D.C., was paused but resumed Tuesday, though passengers were told to expect delays due to single tracking through the area.

Firefighters got word of an ignition just before 7 p.m.

The fire in West Baltimore happened the same day that a fire in downtown Baltimore injured two firefighters, one of them critically.

In rare cases, its maggots will eat your flesh","The U.S. has blocked imports of live cattle, horses, and bison through southern border ports following the resurgence in Mexico of the New World Screwworm, a parasitic fly that infects animals and threatens humans.

New World screwworm flies cause myiasis, an infection of flesh-eating maggots that burrow into the skin of living animals, causing serious and often fatal damage, Reuters reported.

The fly is named for how its maggots burrow, or screw, into an open wound using ""its sharp mouth hooks,"" according to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.

NWS has recently been detected “in remote farms with minimal cattle movement as far north as Oaxaca and Veracruz, about 700 miles away from the U.S. border,” the U.S. Department of Agriculture said in announcing the ban on Sunday.

New World Screwworm began resurgence in Central America

The parasites can infect livestock, wildlife, birds, pets, and, in some rare cases humans, the USDA says. The ban, which affects animals coming from and through Mexico, will continue on a month-by-month basis until the threat is contained, the department said.

NWS was eradicated in the U.S. in the 1960s, in Mexico in the 1970s, and much of Central America in the early 2000s, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

However, new cases were reported in October 2024 in Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Honduras, the CDC said. That sparked concern that the insects would spread north to the United States.

The first case in southern Mexico was reported to the United States in November, the USDA said.

While the United States and Mexico continue to work together to eradicate NWS in Mexico, “there has been unacceptable northward advancement of NWS and additional action must be taken to slow the northern progression of this deadly parasitic fly,” the USDA said.

What's so dangerous about the NWS?

NWS flies, about the size of a common housefly, lay eggs “on open wounds or other open parts of the body in live, warm-blooded animals,” according to the CDC. A wound as small as a tick bite can attract the flies.

The eggs hatch and become larvae, or maggots. They burrow into the wound to feed on the living flesh, the CDC says. That’s different from most other types of maggots that feed on decomposing flesh.

After they feed, the larvae fall to the ground and burrow into it. They later emerge as adult screwworm flies, the CDC says.

As you might expect, burrowing maggots in living creatures are highly painful.

What are the symptoms of NWS infection in humans?

NWS infestations are very painful, the USDA says. If you have an infestation, you may see maggots around or in an open wound, or your nose, eyes, or mouth. Symptoms can include:

◾Unexplained skin lesions (wounds or sores) that do not heal.

◾Skin wounds or sores that worsen over time.

◾Painful skin wounds or sores.

◾Bleeding from open sores.

◾Feeling larvae movement within a skin wound or sore, nose, mouth, or eyes.

◾Seeing maggots around or in open sores.

◾A foul-smelling odor from the site of the infestation.

A secondary bacterial infections sometimes occur and may cause fever or chills.

In animals, the symptoms include:

◾Irritated behavior.

◾Head shaking.

◾Smell of decay.

◾Evidence of a fly strike.

◾Presence of fly maggots in wounds.

What should you do if you get infected?

Maggots in a wound or a body part need to be removed by a medical professional, the CDC says. Don’t try to remove them yourself.

UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty is stepping down immediately from his role for “personal reasons,” the company announced Tuesday.

He will be replaced by Stephen Hemsley, the health insurer’s board chairman and former CEO from 2006 to 2017. Witty, who ran the health care giant for four years, will remain in a limited role as a senior adviser to Hemsley.

“We are grateful for Andrew’s stewardship of UnitedHealth Group, especially during some of the most challenging times any company has ever faced,” Hemsley said in a statement, adding the company has “greatly valued his leadership and compassion as chief executive and as a director and wish him and his family the best.”

Witty helped steer the company following the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson last year. UnitedHealthcare is a unit of the parent company that Witty helmed.

Thompson’s fatal shooting outside a New York hotel brought to light significant public outrage about the health insurance industry, with Witty publicly acknowledging in a New York Times essay that the US health system “is not perfect” and that coverage decisions “are not well understood.”

Witty also defended UnitedHealthcare, the company’s health insurance arm, though he acknowledged that it shares some of the responsibility for the lack of understanding about decisions on care.

Also on Tuesday, UnitedHealth Group (UNH) suspended financial outlook for the year because costs of Medicare Advantage “remained higher than expected.” The company expects to return to growth in 2026.

WASHINGTON — Microsoft began laying off nearly 3% of its entire workforce Tuesday, its largest mass layoff in more than two years.

The tech giant didn't disclose the total amount of lost jobs but it will amount to about 6,000 people. That includes 1,985 workers in its home state of Washington, according to a notice it sent to the state workforce agency Tuesday.

Microsoft employed 228,000 full-time workers as of last June, the last time it reported its annual headcount. About 55% of those workers were in the U.S.

Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, said the layoffs will be across all levels and geographies but the cuts will focus on reducing the number of managers. Notices to employees began going out on Tuesday.

Microsoft announced a smaller round of performance-based layoffs in January. But the 3% cuts will be Microsoft's biggest since early 2023, when the company cut 10,000 workers, almost 5% of its workforce, joining other tech companies that were scaling back their pandemic-era expansions.

The latest layoffs come just weeks after Microsoft reported strong sales and profits that beat Wall Street expectations for the January-March quarter, which investors took as a dose of relief during a turbulent time for the tech sector and U.S. economy.

Microsoft's chief financial officer, Amy Hood, said on an April earnings call that the company was focused on “building high-performing teams and increasing our agility by reducing layers with fewer managers.” She also said the headcount in March was 2% higher than a year earlier, and down slightly compared to the end of last year.

The layoffs are expected to hit across all parts of Microsoft's business, including the career networking site LinkedIn and the video game platform Xbox.

The company didn't give a specific reason for the layoffs, only that they were part of ""organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace.”

Microsoft has said it has been spending $80 billion in the fiscal year that ends in June on building data centers and other infrastructure it needs to develop to operate its artificial intelligence technology. Those AI tools have been pitched as changing the way people work, including in Microsoft's own workplaces.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg at an AI event last month at Meta's headquarters that “maybe 20, 30% of the code” for some of Microsoft's coding projects “are probably all written by software.”","The layoffs are expected to hit across all parts of Microsoft's business, including the career networking site LinkedIn and the video game platform Xbox.

On November 17, 2023, the board of OpenAI fired company CEO Sam Altman. His friend Chesky leapt into action—publicly defending his pal on X, getting on the phone with Microsoft’s CEO, and throwing himself into the thick of Altman’s battle to retake OpenAI. Five days later Altman prevailed, and Chesky—“I was so jacked up,” he says—turned his buzzing mind to his own company, Airbnb.

Thanksgiving weekend was beginning. The Chesky extended family had already held their turkey get-together a week earlier, and the Airbnb CEO had no holiday plan. He was completely alone in his sprawling San Francisco apartment except for Sophie, his golden retriever.

Still wired out of his mind from the cathartic corporate rescue, Chesky began to write. He wanted to bust the company he’d cofounded out of its pigeonhole of short-term home rentals. Amazon, he was fond of pointing out, was first an online bookstore before it became the everything store. Chesky had long believed that Airbnb should expand in a similar way. But things kept getting in the way—dealing with safety issues, fighting regulation, coping with the existential crisis of a global pandemic. The company was in danger of being tagged with the word that ambitious entrepreneurs dread like the plague: mature.

Now Chesky was emboldened to lay out his vision. Home rentals are simply a service, so why stop there? Airbnb could be the platform for booking all sorts of services. While other apps cover specific sectors—food delivery, home maintenance, car rides—Chesky figured that Airbnb’s experience in attractively displaying homes, vetting hosts, and responding to crises could make it more trustworthy than competitors and therefore the go-to option for virtually anything.

In a frantic typing spree at the dining room table, on the couch, the bed, and at times in his office, Chesky specced out how he would redesign the Airbnb app. Its users—now at 2 billion—would open up the app not only at vacation time but whenever they needed to find a portrait photographer, a personal trainer, or someone to cook their meals. Chesky reasoned that Airbnb would need to significantly strengthen its identity verification. He even thought he could get people to use the app as a credential, something as respected as a government-issued ID. If he could transform Airbnb into a storefront for real-world services, Chesky thought, he’d catapult his company from a nearly $10-billion-a-year business into one that boasted membership in tech’s pantheon.

Over the next few days, Chesky spilled these thoughts into an Evernote document. “I was basically going from room to room just pouring out this stream-of-consciousness manifesto, like Jack Kerouac writing On the Road,” he says, referring to the frenetically produced single roll of teletype paper that catalyzed the beat movement. “I dusted off all my ideas from 2012 to 2016,” Chesky tells me. “I basically said, ‘We’re not just a vacation app—we’re going to be a platform, a community.’” By Friday he had around 10,000 words, “incomprehensible to anyone but me.” He began to refine it, and by the time the weekend was over, Chesky had distilled his document down to 1,500 words.","As Brian Chesky tells it, the reinvention of Airbnb started with the coup at OpenAI.

The service, which will be called ESPN, will live inside a completely redesigned ESPN app.

“As we explored options, we kept coming back to our four letters, ESPN,” said Jimmy Pitaro, who leads ESPN, during a press briefing in Disney’s New York office Tuesday morning, framing the decision as “simple, straightforward, clear.”

ESPN is also launching a promotional launch price of $29.99 for the bundle of all three services for the first 12 months. In connection with the launch, ESPN will rebrand ESPN+ as ESPN select, and will still cost $11.99.

The company is also offering an annual plan for $299.99, and a no-ads option (for Disney+ and Hulu) for $44.99 per month.

Pitaro says that subscribers to pay TV bundles with access to ESPN will have access to the streaming service, reiterating that the company is “largely platform agnostic.”

“We are ultimately going to judge ourselves based on the totality of people subscribing to ESPN,” Pitaro added. “We’re very happy with the traditional world, the traditional ecosystem. We’ve done a lot to protect that ecosystem, and we will continue to make the traditional ecosystem a priority.”

He added that in Disney’s conversations with its distribution partners, it has been “open book” about the streaming plans, seeking to ensure seamless access for pay-TV customers.

The company also said that Rich Eisen would return to the company, bringing his Rich Eisen Show to both Disney+ and ESPN. Beyond that, ESPN confirmed that it will include ESPN’s full suite of live sports and studio shows, with the company also set to unveil other partners in the coming months.

Other programing news will likely come ahead of the fall launch, though Pitaro teased a few other priorities for the company: A desire to cut deals with leagues for regional sports networks, which the company could offer as an upsell, and finding ways to utilize AI in the tech stack.

“We are very much focused on on AI, and are working with some of our key talent right now, getting them on board with this idea that having the storytelling being driven by AI,” Pitaro said.","ESPN pulled back the curtain on its long-awaited direct-to-consumer streaming service Tuesday, planning a fall launch at $29.99 per month, or $35.99 for a bundle that will include Disney+ and Hulu.

On Monday evening, there were as few as three air traffic controllers at a Philadelphia radar center scheduled each hour to guide planes that were flying into and out of Newark Liberty International Airport, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.

That's despite a target of 14 air traffic controllers for that time period, per an agreement between the FAA and the air traffic controllers union, The New York Times reported. NPR has not independently confirmed that report. The FAA did not reply to NPR's question about the agreement, and the union did not reply to multiple requests to comment.

In an emailed statement to NPR, FAA spokesperson Rick Breitenfeldt said ""at least three controllers were scheduled for each hour"" at the Philadelphia facility that manages air traffic at Newark on Monday night.

""We plan for staffing with traffic management initiatives to ensure safety is never compromised,"" Breitenfeldt added.

Monday night's slim staffing came as the FAA struggles to keep air travel flowing smoothly through one of the busiest airports in the country, where technological troubles, a worker shortage and ongoing runway construction have hampered operations in recent weeks.

To address these challenges, the FAA has slowed arrivals and departures at Newark , leading to scores of cancellations and delays for frustrated fliers.

""If we reduce the number of flights at Newark, we're not doing it to annoy people. We're not doing it to delay people's travel. What we're doing is guaranteeing safety,"" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a Monday press conference.

While air traffic controllers in an airport's tower handle flight traffic within a few-mile radius where it is often visible to the eye, the Terminal Radar Approach Control — or TRACON — directs incoming and outgoing planes that are further away from an airport.

Management of flight traffic at Newark was moved from Long Island to Philadelphia last summer. (Duffy said the Biden administration ""bungled"" the relocation and didn't address technical problems that arose in the fall.)

The part of the Philadelphia facility controlling Newark airspace has 22 fully certified controllers and five fully certified supervisors, the FAA said in a separate statement Tuesday. There are also 21 controllers and supervisors in training — 10 of whom are receiving on-the-job training and are certified in at least one position, which means they can work without supervision from an instructor.

The agency also emphasized that the U.S. is facing a national shortage of air traffic controllers and said staffing goals for Newark's airspace have not been met for years.

The low staff levels at Newark have worried some travelers, but a shortage of controllers alone would not likely pose a threat to passenger safety, says John Hansman, a professor of aeronautics and astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

""We run the system very conservatively and very safely,"" Hansman said. In most cases, an insufficient number of air traffic controllers just means a slowdown in traffic, he said.

""If you get to this very extreme case we appear to be in, then you have secondary concerns about fatigue and stress, et cetera, that may degrade performance, but I don't think we've necessarily seen that at this point,"" Hansman added.

Brief communications outages in Philadelphia in late April and early May hampered operations in Newark. After the first incident, several air traffic controllers took time off in response to the stress and trauma they experienced, NPR previously reported.

Another telecommunications issue in Philadelphia on Sunday briefly slowed traffic at Newark, but Duffy said a Friday evening software update successfully kept a redundant communications line functioning and prevented a full-blown outage.

Duffy has called the national air traffic control system ""antiquated"" and last week announced a plan to overhaul it.","As few as 3 radar controllers monitored Newark's airspace Monday night, FAA saystoggle caption Andres Kudacki/Getty ImagesOn Monday evening, there were as few as three air traffic controllers at a Philadelphia radar center scheduled each hour to guide planes that were flying into and out of Newark Liberty International Airport, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.

The S&P 500 benchmark stock index hit another milestone in its remarkable march higher from the brink of a bear market in recent weeks: It has now erased all its losses for this year.

US stocks were mixed Tuesday as investors digested cooling inflation data and easing trade tensions between the United States and China. The Dow closed lower by 270 points, or 0.64%. Meanwhile, the broader S&P 500 rose 0.72% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 1.61%.

For the year, the Dow is still down 0.95% and the Nasdaq Composite is down 1.56% this year.

Wall Street got a major boost on Monday after Washington and Beijing brokered an agreement to substantially lower tariffs for 90 days. Stocks rose further on Tuesday as new data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed a surprising cooldown in annual inflation ahead of the impact of Trump’s tariffs. Consumer prices in April recorded their lowest annual increase since February 2021.

Stocks have been on a tear for the past month after Trump began to change his tune on tariffs, announcing carve-outs for some tariffs on China and the prospect of inking some trade deals.

“Fears of slowing growth and a recession caused by punitive tariffs drove markets lower in the first week of April, but they’ve rebounded on the heels of a tariff pause and a Chinese trade breakthrough, and now a better-than-expected inflation report removes the last big overhang for the market,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Northlight Asset Management, in a Tuesday note.

Nvidia (NVDA) surged 5.63% Tuesday after the chip giant announced it would partner with Saudi Arabia on artificial intelligence initiatives.

The Dow was the only index that fell on Tuesday. It was largely weighed down by UnitedHealth Group (UNH), which sank 17.8% after the company suspended its earnings guidance and CEO Andrew Witty said he would step down for personal reasons. The Dow is weighted by share prices, and UnitedHealth has a significant influence on the index’s performance.","US stocks were mixed Tuesday as investors digested cooling inflation data and easing trade tensions between the United States and China.

The initiative involves a partnership with Synchron, a neurotechnology startup that produces an implantable brain-computer interface (BCI) device called the Stentrode. The Stentrode enables users with severe motor impairments, such as those caused by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), to control Apple devices using neural signals detected from within blood vessels located above the brain's motor cortex.

The Stentrode is implanted through the jugular vein and rests inside a blood vessel on the surface of the brain. The device contains 16 electrodes that can detect motor-related brain activity without requiring open-brain surgery. These neural signals are then translated into digital commands that allow users to interact with an interface.

Synchron has implanted the Stentrode in ten patients since 2019 under the FDA's investigational device exemption. One test participant based in Pennsylvania with ALS, who cannot use his arms or hands, is able to use the Apple Vision Pro and other Apple devices through thought alone, although it is slower than conventional input mechanisms.

In 2014, Apple introduced the ""Made for iPhone"" hearing aid protocol as a Bluetooth standard that enables seamless wireless communication between hearing aids and Apple devices. The company is now apparently pursuing a similar approach with brain-computer interfaces, aiming to establish a dedicated industry standard in collaboration with Synchron.

Apple is apparently planning to add support for BCIs into its existing Switch Control accessibility framework, which allows input from non-standard devices such as joysticks and adaptive hardware. The company reportedly intends to release this new standard later in 2025.

Synchron's approach differs significantly from that of other companies such as Neuralink, which is developing a more invasive implant called the N1. Neuralink's device contains more than 1,000 electrodes embedded directly into brain tissue, providing a higher-resolution neural data stream. This allows for more complex control, including moving a cursor across a screen and typing using mental intention.

An executive order Monday from President Donald Trump said the tariffs on low-value parcels originating from China and coming through the U.S. Postal Service will be lowered to 54%, down from 120%.

It also says a per-package flat rate — as an alternative to the value-based tariff — will be kept at $100, rather than being raised to $200 on June 1 as previously decreed. Packages shipped by commercial carriers are subject to the general tariff, which also has been cut.

The new rules go into effect Wednesday.

They are part of a broader agreement by the Trump administration to drastically lower import taxes on all Chinese goods from 145% to 30% following weekend talks in Switzerland with Chinese officials. China issued a public notice on Tuesday lowering its own tariffs on U.S. goods to 10%, down from 125%.

However, the reductions are temporary, allowing the two sides to negotiate a longer-term deal in the next 90 days.

Izzy Rosenzweig, founder and CEO of the logistic company Portless, said U.S. brands are “very excited” about the broader tariff cut. The import tax is still high, but not as prohibitive as when it was 145%, which amounted to a trade embargo.

On the low-value shipments, online purchases had been coming into the U.S. duty-free for several years under the de minimis rule, which exempted them from the import tax.

Popular shopping sites such as Shein and Temu that offer ultra-low prices took advantage of the duty-free rule by shipping directly from China to U.S. buyers, bypassing more cumbersome customs paperwork.

President Donald Trump terminated the exemption on such parcels originating from China and Hong Kong on May 2, following criticism that it not only resulted in lost tariff revenue but also allowed illicit drugs and unsafe products to flow into the U.S. without adequate scrutiny.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection said as many as 4 million low-value parcels were coming into the U.S. every day — many of which originated from China.

Shortly before the exemption ended on May 2, prices on many items sold by Shein rose. Temu apparently halted shipments from China and tapped its existing inventory in the U.S.

John Lash, group vice president of product strategy at the supply chain platform e2open, said he expected the volume of low-value packages would now rise but not back to previous levels. The $100 flat rate, he said, means that higher-value packages could get less of a hit, because the effective duty rate could be as low as 13%.

Neither Shein nor Temu immediately responded to requests for comment Tuesday about the lower tariffs.","An executive order Monday from President Donald Trump said the tariffs on low-value parcels originating from China and coming through the U.S.

NEW JERSEY (WABC) -- Agencies across the area are preparing for a possible New Jersey Transit strike on Friday that could cause big problems for commuters.

The union that represents the engineers who drive the trains is threatening to walk off the job as soon as Friday if a contract deal is not reached.

It would be the first transit strike in 42 years and potentially impact 350,000 people.

Governor Phil Murphy said the state is preparing for the worst but hoping for the best as the deadline nears.

""I'm hoping and praying that they can find the common ground to avoid a strike,"" Murphy said.

Talks have been underway in Washington, D.C. between the Brotherhood of Local Engineers and Trainmen and the head of New Jersey Transit.

Monday's negotiations were called productive, with the only major sticking point being wages for the 450 members of the union.

The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey announced the following guidance in the event of a suspension of NJ Transit rail service.

Here are the alternate routes passengers need to know:

Midtown Bus Terminal

NJ TRANSIT has provided a rail service disruption plan that includes supplemental bus service to the Midtown Bus Terminal.

Some private commuter carriers are planning to add or modify service to accommodate additional passengers.

As a precaution, some carriers will be moving temporarily to provide space for additional NJ TRANSIT bus arrivals and departures.

Passengers should review bus departure gates carefully.

Beginning Monday, May 12, all Trailways departures will depart out of gates 64-68 on the lower level of the north wing.

The Lincoln Tunnel's Exclusive Bus Lane, currently in effect weekdays beginning at 6 a.m., will have expanded hours if needed.

Expect crowded conditions during peak hours in the bus terminal as NJ TRANSIT has limited capacity to accommodate displaced rail passengers by bus.

Passengers should allow extra travel time.

The Port Authority will be providing additional staff to assist with passenger navigation and crowd management.

PATH Commuter Rail

On weekdays, PATH service will operate on a normal schedule.

As always, PATH will monitor stations and add service as necessary to address any unsafe crowding conditions.

During peak hours customers could experience temporary crowding conditions.

Those who do not need to ride during peak hours are urged to avoid the system during that time.

Additional PATH staff will be available to assist with passenger navigation and crowd management.

Existing mass transit to/from Newark Liberty International Airport:

In the event of a suspension of NJ TRANSIT rail service, NJ TRANSIT trains will not serve the Newark Liberty International Airport rail station.

Select Amtrak trains will continue to serve the station. Passengers will need an Amtrak ticket to board an Amtrak train. AirTrain Newark will continue operating to/from the Airport Train Station for Amtrak passengers.

Travelers are urged to make use of bus lines serving Newark Liberty International Airport. Those include NJ TRANSIT buses GO 28 (Bloomfield-Newark), 37 (Maplewood-Irvington-Newark), 62 (Newark-Elizabeth), 67 (Ocean-Monmouth-Middlesex-Newark), and Coach USA express service to/from Manhattan.

Drivers should allow additional travel time and expect crowded conditions on airport roadways.

New travel option provided by the Port Authority between Newark-Penn Station and Newark Liberty International Airport:

UPDATE: Beginning May 16, the Port Authority will operate free, direct shuttle bus service between Newark-Penn Station and AirTrain Newark's P4 station every 20 minutes. The free shuttle buses will not operate between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m., traditionally when NJ TRANSIT does not operate rail service. Travelers should allow additional travel time and expect crowded conditions on buses and at stations

Additional Port Authority staff will be available to assist with passenger navigation and crowd management at Newark-Penn Station and the airport.

Getting to Newark Airport from Newark-Penn Station:

UPDATE: At Newark-Penn Station, passengers should follow signs and staff direction to the pickup/drop-off point at Raymond Plaza West. The shuttle bus will travel directly to AirTrain Newark's P4 station. There, travelers can board AirTrain Newark to access all airport terminals.

Getting from Newark Airport to Newark-Penn Station:

Take AirTrain Newark to the P4 Station. There, travelers should proceed to the ground level and follow the direction of Port Authority staff to the shuttle bus pickup/drop-off point. The shuttle bus will travel directly to Newark-Penn Station.

Chime had reportedly filed confidential S-1 paperwork back in December.

S-1 filings typically reveal all kinds of information, covering financial, legal, and other risk factors. But Chime’s S-1 documents still have a lot of blank spaces. We don’t know how many shares it hopes to sell or at what price. Chime could be aiming to raise $1 billion, IPO specialist Renaissance Capital believes.

We also don’t know how many shares insiders plan to sell as part of the IPO. This includes its major backers, a list that includes billionaire Yuri Milner’s DST Global, Michael Stark’s Crosslink Capital, billionaire Len Blavatnik’s Access Industries, as well as VC firms General Atlantic, Menlo Ventures (led by board member Shawn Carolan), the Sino French Innovation Fund, and Iconiq, according to the paperwork.

Chime raised $2.65 billion total as a private company, including its last raise in 2021 that valued it at $25 billion, PitchBook estimates. As a result, there are many more VCs on its cap table. They, too, could be in for big paydays. For instance, Kirsten Green’s Forerunner Ventures and Hunter Walk’s Homebrew both claim Chime as a portfolio company.

Chime offered one detail that suggests the company believes it will be a huge IPO. Chime enlisted an army of big name investment bankers, including Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and JP Morgan.

The financials show why investors may grow excited. The company finished 2024 with $1.67 billion in revenue and $25 million in losses, compared to nearly $1.3 billion in revenue and $203 million in losses in 2023. Its 2025 first-quarter revenue was already $519 million. So, by Silicon Valley math, that puts it on track for $2 billion this year and near profitability.

Chime offers consumer checking, savings, debit, and credit cards and claims 8.6 million active users.

One interesting reveal in the paperwork. Its board member Cynthia Marshall served as the CEO of the Dallas Mavericks from 2018 to December 2024. Chime became a Mavericks sponsor during that time.

In a statement published on its website, State Farm said that the insurer remains “deeply concerned about the financial position of State Farm General” — the insurer’s California subsidiary — “as it is difficult to match price to risk in California.” The statement further pointed to the decision by S&P Global Ratings on Tuesday to downgrade the California State Farm subsidiary from an “AA” to an “A+” rating, a move attributed in part to “a significant deterioration” in the company’s capital position over the last five years.

During the recent hearing in California and in the process that ensued, State Farm was forced to make some concessions — lowering the rate hike to 17 percent, from nearly 22 percent, as well as requiring State Farm’s parent company to provide an infusion of $400 million in cash to its California affiliate. For years, advocates for policyholders have argued that the way in which insurers have organized themselves — with major national companies like State Farm having both a national company and a California subsidiary — protects the insurer but not the customer.

The higher rate comes after survivors of the Eaton fire in the working-class community of Altadena organized, first on a WhatsApp group dedicated to pickleball and later on Discord, a platform better known for gaming.

Federal tax credits that benefit energy developers, manufacturers and utilities face an early phaseout in a budget proposal released Monday by a key GOP-controlled House committee.

The House Ways and Means Committee’s draft reconciliation package steps down the investment and production tax credits for nuclear power, wind, solar, batteries, geothermal and other clean energy technologies after 2028, and eliminates them completely after 2031. It preserves a comparatively generous credit for carbon sequestration and extends the clean fuels production credit.

Energy industry groups and customers slammed the proposal, saying it would raise electricity prices, quash a manufacturing boom spurred by the Inflation Reduction Act and erode the United States’ competitive advantage on artificial intelligence.

Dive Insight:

The Ways and Means budget gives clean energy developers and producers until 2028 to claim the full 45Y and 48E tax credits for clean energy investment and production. The credit values step down to 80% in 2029, 60% in 2030 and 40% in 2031 before zeroing out in 2032. A separate credit for nuclear power production would phase out on the same schedule.

As originally passed, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 allowed taxpayers to claim the full value of all three credits into 2032.

“While our industry is ready to engage constructively and find a workable path forward, the Committee’s approach simply goes too far too fast,” American Clean Power Association CEO Jason Grumet said in a statement. “With energy demand surging, this is not the time for disruption.”

The Ways and Means proposal also tightens eligibility for 45Y and 48E by requiring projects to be “placed in service” to qualify for the credit. The Inflation Reduction Act based eligibility on the year projects began construction, a more generous framework in a world where the timeline for grid interconnection and long-lead electrical equipment can stretch for years.

The placed-in-service requirement “severely crimps utility scale renewables” to the point that “the only projects that will get the full ITC and PTC are those already in the queue,” Advait Arun, senior associate for energy finance at the Center for Public Enterprise, said in an interview.

Clean energy advocates warned that the Ways and Means budget could disproportionately harm the “clean firm” technologies President Trump and House Republicans seem to favor, like advanced nuclear and geothermal.

“Some of America’s largest companies are attempting to advance critical new technologies like geothermal and advanced nuclear energy, but those technologies will not move forward if these tax credits are phased out,” Clean Energy Buyers Association CEO Rich Powell said in a statement. Powell’s organization represents major technology and industrial firms driving demand for clean electricity, such as Microsoft and Amazon.

A key nuclear power trade group whose April 30 plea to preserve key IRA tax credits attracted more than 100 signatories earlier this month said the Ways and Means budget would set back an industry critical to U.S. national security.

“Underlying conditions in the market have not changed and nuclear energy is not appropriately valued for its ability to provide reliable, secure, and affordable energy to an increasingly clean electric grid,” Michael Flannigan, vice president of governmental affairs at the Nuclear Energy Institute, said in a statement.

An early end to clean energy tax credits would compound the impacts of downsizing at the Department of Energy, particularly in the DOE Loan Programs Office and Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Arun said.

“If those [programs] are all going in the can, it will have just as much of an impact on the emerging technology landscape” as any changes to the tax code, he said.

A proposed two-year sunset of the IRA’s tax credit transferability mechanism could further curtail clean energy investment, Arun said. The IRA created a new pathway for project developers and asset owners with limited tax liability to raise capital by transferring tax credits — at a discount dependent in part on the deal’s perceived risk — to third-party buyers with greater tax liability.

The change would affect small and midsize clean energy developers the most, putting them at a disadvantage to incumbents closer to the big banks that dominate the more complex, gated world of traditional tax equity finance and have limited capacity to take on new clients, Arun said.

“Transferability is the biggest new development in clean energy markets … to shut that down will dry up a lot of the liquidity clean energy developers have been counting on,” he said.

On an earnings call last week, before Ways and Means released its draft budget, Sunrun Chief Financial Officer Danny Abajian said his distributed energy company would have to temporarily “[shift] how we source capital” were transferability repealed. But he said Sunrun could eventually benefit from a “flight to quality” in a tighter tax credit market.

Crux, an energy capital markets platform that has emerged as a key player in the nascent transferability industry, said in a subscriber email Monday that the Ways and Means proposal “is just the starting point and we anticipate that the final bill will take a more favorable stance on transferability and tax credits.”

Though both are subject to new restrictions on transferability and foreign ownership, the Ways and Means proposal treats the 45Q tax credit for carbon capture and sequestration and the 45Z credit for clean fuels production more favorably than the technology-neutral credits. The proposal maintains 45Q through 2032 and extends the 45Z credit through 2031, giving producers of biofuels like ethanol and sustainable aviation fuel four more years to claim it.

Hydrogen producers are not so lucky. The Ways and Means proposal eliminates the 45V credit for clean hydrogen production after this year, less than 12 months after the Treasury Department released final guidance.

Most of the popular consumer and builder tax credits for efficient home appliances, solar panels, electric vehicles and EV chargers are also set to wind down this year. Credits for electric and other clean-fuel fleet vehicles end after this year as well, with a seven-year grace period for orders covered by existing contracts.","Dive Brief:Federal tax credits that benefit energy developers, manufacturers and utilities face an early phaseout in a budget proposal released Monday by a key GOP-controlled House committee.

Many people saw the no-frills vehicle, with an easy-to-repair body and nostalgic hand crank windows, as a refreshing antidote to today’s overstuffed and increasingly unaffordable cars.

How unaffordable? Average monthly payments on new cars have soared to $739 in March from $537 in January 2019, according to Cox Automotive. The average new car costs $47,400, with electric models around $59,200. High interest rates, now around 9.4 percent for a 72-month loan, have made cars even more of a financial stretch.

“Prices and interest rates are both high and stuck,” said Mark Schirmer, director of industry insights for Cox Automotive. “If you haven’t been in the market since 2018, it’s got to be shocking what a car costs.”

President Trump’s tariffs of 25 percent on imported cars and parts have consumers scrambling to buy before prices rise even more. Cars that cost less than $30,000 are especially vulnerable — nearly 80 percent of those are subject to tariffs. They include consumer staples like the American-made Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla, which rely on imported parts. Supplies of budget models are expected to shrink, and automakers may stop importing certain models entirely.","When Slate Auto, a start-up, unveiled a roughly $25,000 electric pickup truck last month, social media lit up with comments.

Coinbase (COIN) shares skyrocketed on Tuesday following news the cryptocurrency exchange will be added to the S&P 500.

Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in U.S., will replace Discover Financial Services (DFS) in the benchmark index before trading opens next Monday, marking a major milestone for the company, which went public in April 2021.

The inclusion comes less than a week after the company said that it had agreed to acquire Deribit, a crypto options exchange, for $2.9 billion in cash and stock, the same day it posted first-quarter earnings that came in below Wall Street expectations.

Coinbase shares jumped 24% on Tuesday to close at around $257. With that move, the stock has inched into positive territory for 2025, rebounding from an early-April low of around $142.

Below, we break down the technicals on the Coinbase chart and point out key price levels that investors will likely be watching.

Inverse Head and Shoulders Pattern Breakout

Coinbase shares forged an inverse head and shoulders pattern on the chart between March and May, with the price staging a decisive breakout above the formation’s neckline on Tuesday.

Even before today's rally, the stock had registered higher-than-average volume over the previous three trading sessions, indicating that larger market participants had accumulated shares in preparation for a significant price move.

Let’s identify key overhead areas on the Coinbase chart to watch amid the potential for further upside and also locate a major support level worth monitoring during possible declines.

Key Overhead Areas to Watch

The $245 level was a key area to watch coming into Tuesday's session as it was near two closely aligned troughs that formed on the chart in December and January.

With that level comfortably surpassed, shares could climb to the $273 level. Investors who have bought at lower prices may look to place sell orders in this region near a horizontal line the connects a range of peaks and troughs on the chart extending back to March last year.

This level also corresponds with a measured move price target that calculates the depth of the inverse head and shoulders pattern in points and adds that amount to the formation’s neckline. For example, adding $65 to $208 projects a target of $273.

A more-bullish move higher may trigger a rally toward $330. This area on the chart could provide selling pressure near several peaks that developed on the chart just below the stock’s December high.

Major Support Level Worth Monitoring

During retracements in Coinbase shares, investors should monitor the $208 level. This location on the chart would likely attract buying interest on a retest of the inverse head and shoulders’ neckline, which may turn into a major support area after Tuesday’s breakout.

The company even claims this new type of battery pack could lower the cost of its electric SUVs so they're comparable to their gasoline counterparts.

The news came today as GM has announced it will use lithium manganese-rich (LMR) battery cells in its largest electric vehicles, the full-size trucks and SUVs sold by Chevrolet, GMC, and Cadillac. They are to be produced by Ultium Cells, its joint-venture battery company with LG Energy Solutions. The first such cells will come from a pilot line in 2027, with full volume production in 2028 at a plant it hasn’t disclosed.

The new cells are in the prismatic format, versus Ultium’s current pouch cells, which use a nickel-cobalt-manganese-aluminum chemistry. Those cells, in large standardized modules, power GM’s entire current EV lineup, from the compact Chevrolet Equinox EV up to the GMC Hummer EV.

The new prismatic cells appear even larger than Ultium’s pouch cells, though GM did not provide dimensions. They will be housed in modules that, overall, have 50 percent fewer parts than their predecessors. That may prevent delays like those that delayed volume production of its Ultium modules by 12 to 18 months, pushing deliveries of several models from late 2022 to early 2024.

Lower Cost, Higher Energy Density

A full-size prototype GM LMR battery cell. GM has apparently prototyped 300 full-size LMR cells to crack the code on the new chemistry that offers up a third more energy density at no extra production cost. Photograph: Steve Fecht for General Motors

Crucially, GM claims its Ultium battery engineers have created a chemistry that provides one-third greater energy density than comparable lithium iron-phosphate (LFP)—at a comparable cell cost. China owns virtually all the intellectual property around LFP chemistry, which costs less in materials than NMCA because it uses none of those metals. The trade-off for lower cost is lower energy density by volume.","The news came today as GM has announced it will use lithium manganese-rich (LMR) battery cells in its largest electric vehicles, the full-size trucks and SUVs sold by Chevrolet, GMC, and Cadillac.

He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.

By the time you read these words, it’s quite possible that Adorama will be out of stock of the new DJI Mavic 4 Pro. But when I wrote them, the US-based retailer was still selling a drone that wasn’t supposed to go on sale in the US at all, with roughly 70 left in stock.

This morning, I wrote how DJI was skipping the US with its most advanced drone yet, citing Trump’s tariffs among other reasons for the decision. DJI did not send the drone to US reviewers, and it wouldn’t provide US prices when we asked.

But Adorama and B&H, two rival camera stores based in New York City, apparently didn’t get the message!

Today, they both listed the drone for $2,699 — or $3,549 for the Fly More Kit, or $4,649 for the Creator Combo with the fancy new controller with the folding sticks and swiveling 1600-nit screen, or $1,299 for that controller all by its lonesome. B&H even issued a press release.

B&H is only offering preorders today; I confirmed with Miguel Perez in the store’s drone department that “we don’t yet have it in stock,” and he wasn’t sure when stock might arrive. “It’s a little bit of a grey area for logistics between the US and China for aircraft,” he admits. But he says B&H isn’t taking anyone’s money — “we don’t charge until it ships” — and that he’s heard other US retailers like Adorama are selling the drone this very week.

Adorama sales rep Steve Chill confirms that over the phone, and offers to put one on hold for me, because he says they’re moving fast. “We had a few hundred in stock, now we’re down to 70,” he says. “They’ll be gone tomorrow.”

Over the phone, he says he has the $3,549 Fly More Combo right now if I want, though he’s out of the $2,699 base model. (At the time I reached out, Adorama’s website was showing the entry model in stock, shipping next week, though it’s now just listing a preorder again; however, the new DJI RC Pro 2 controller appears to be in stock too.)

It’s not clear what’s happening. Did DJI ship some to the US early, but not enough for a full launch, perhaps? DJI spokesperson Daisy Kong doesn’t have an answer for me yet.

He has been covering the business & culture of video games for two decades.

Last week, Nintendo predicted it would sell 15 million Switch 2 consoles in its current financial year. This would actually be a fantastic result — equalling Switch, and just about any console you care to mention — but analysts called the figure “conservative” and “on the low side.” That’s just how high the expectations for Switch 2 sales are.

The consensus was that Nintendo’s conservative estimate was due to uncertainty around President Donald Trump’s tariffs, but in some unusually direct comments during an investor Q&A, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa denied this was the case. Instead, he said it was the system’s high price that has made Nintendo cautious in its outlook.

“Nintendo Switch 2 is priced relatively high compared to Nintendo Switch, so we recognize that there are corresponding challenges to early adoption,” Furukawa said. “We are taking steps like bundling software with the hardware to accelerate adoption in the first fiscal year, aiming to get off to the same start we did with Nintendo Switch.”

Furukawa cautioned that investors shouldn’t get carried away over the extreme demand for Switch 2 pre-orders. Due to the system’s high price, he said that “even if there is momentum around the launch, we know it will not be easy to keep that momentum going over the long term through the holiday season and beyond.”

Furukawa said that its production capacity for Switch 2 was “not a factor” in settings its forecast, and neither was the unstable economic situation. “The tariff situation in the U.S. or a possibility of a recession did not affect

our sales volume forecast either,” he said.

He went on to give Nintendo’s fullest statement yet in response to U.S. tariffs, saying that it was working on the assumption that the current tariff rates would persist for the rest of the financial year, which would result in “a negative impact of several tens of billions of yen at the profit level.”

“Our basic policy is that for any country or region, if tariffs are imposed, we recognize them as a part of the cost and incorporate them into the price,” he said. “However, this year marks our first new dedicated video game system launch in eight years, so given our unique situation, our priority is to maintain the momentum of our platforms, which is extremely important for our dedicated video game platform business, and to rapidly expand the install base of our new hardware. Consequently, if the assumptions on tariffs change, we will consider what kind of price adjustments would be appropriate, taking into account various factors such as the market conditions.”

To translate this from CEO-speak: Nintendo would usually slap the cost of tariffs onto the price of its hardware, but didn’t do so in this case because it wants to sell as many Switch 2s as possible. It’s not ruling out making pricing changes as the situation evolves (but it probably won’t).","Last week, Nintendo predicted it would sell 15 million Switch 2 consoles in its current financial year.

Paleontologists at the Manitoba Museum and Royal Ontario Museum (ROM) have discovered a remarkable new 506-million-year-old predator from the Burgess Shale of Canada. The results are announced in a paper in the journal Royal Society Open Science.

Mosura fentoni was about the size of an index finger and had three eyes, spiny jointed claws, a circular mouth lined with teeth and a body with swimming flaps along its sides. These traits show it to be part of an extinct group known as the radiodonts, which also included the famous Anomalocaris canadensis, a meter-long predator that shared the waters with Mosura.

However, Mosura also possessed a feature not seen in any other radiodont: an abdomen-like body region made up of multiple segments at its back end.

""Mosura has 16 tightly packed segments lined with gills at the rear end of its body. This is a neat example of evolutionary convergence with modern groups, like horseshoe crabs, woodlice, and insects, which share a batch of segments bearing respiratory organs at the rear of the body,"" says Joe Moysiuk, Curator of Paleontology and Geology at the Manitoba Museum, who led the study.

The reason for this intriguing adaptation remains uncertain, but the researchers postulate it may be related to particular habitat preference or behavioral characteristics of Mosura that required more efficient respiration.

With its broad swimming flaps near its midsection and narrow abdomen, Mosura was nicknamed the ""sea-moth"" by field collectors based on its vague appearance to a moth. This inspired its scientific name, which references the fictional Japanese kaiju also known as Mothra.

Only distantly related to real moths—as well as spiders, crabs, and millipedes—Mosura belongs on a much deeper branch in the evolutionary tree of these animals, collectively known as arthropods.

""Radiodonts were the first group of arthropods to branch out in the evolutionary tree, so they provide key insight into ancestral traits for the entire group. The new species emphasizes that these early arthropods were already surprisingly diverse and were adapting in a comparable way to their distant modern relatives,"" says study co-author Jean-Bernard Caron, Richard M. Ivey Curator of Invertebrate Paleontology at ROM.

Several fossils of Mosura additionally show details of internal anatomy, including elements of the nervous system, circulatory system, and digestive tract.

""Very few fossil sites in the world offer this level of insight into soft internal anatomy. We can see traces representing bundles of nerves in the eyes that would have been involved in image processing, just like in living arthropods. The details are astounding,"" Caron adds.

Instead of having arteries and veins like we do, Mosura had an ""open"" circulatory system, with its heart pumping blood into large internal body cavities called lacunae. These lacunae are preserved as reflective patches that fill the body and extend into the swimming flaps in the fossils.

""The well-preserved lacunae of the circulatory system in Mosura help us to interpret similar, but less clear features that we've seen before in other fossils. Their identity has been controversial,"" adds Moysiuk, who is also a Research Associate at ROM. ""It turns out that preservation of these structures is widespread, confirming the ancient origin of this type of circulatory system.""

Of the 61 fossils of Mosura, all except one were collected by ROM between 1975 and 2022, mostly from the Raymond Quarry in Yoho National Park, British Columbia. Some also came from new areas around Marble Canyon in Kootenay National Park, 40 km to the southeast, which have revealed spectacular new Burgess Shale fossils, including other radiodonts: Stanleycaris, Cambroraster and Titanokorys. One previously unpublished specimen of Mosura was also studied that had been collected by Charles Walcott, the discoverer of the Burgess Shale.

""Museum collections, old and new, are a bottomless treasure trove of information about the past. If you think you've seen it all before, you just need to open up a museum drawer,"" Moysiuk says.

The Burgess Shale fossil sites are located within Yoho and Kootenay National Parks and are managed by Parks Canada. Parks Canada is proud to work with leading scientific researchers to expand knowledge and understanding of this key period of Earth's history and to share these sites with the world through award-winning guided hikes.

The Burgess Shale was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1980 due to its outstanding universal value and is now part of the larger Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks World Heritage Site.

Many radiodont fossils can be seen on display in ROM's Willner Madge Gallery, Dawn of Life, in Toronto, and a specimen of Mosura will be exhibited for the first time at the Manitoba Museum in Winnipeg later this year.

Using the telescope’s most recent observations of the gas giant, scientists uncovered a curious discrepancy between how Jupiter’s auroras appear to Webb versus Hubble.

Webb’s NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera) zoomed into Jupiter’s poles to capture the planet’s fast-varying auroral features, which are 100 times brighter than the ones seen on Earth.

“We wanted to see how quickly the auroras change, expecting them to fade in and out ponderously, perhaps over a quarter of an hour or so,” Jonathan Nichols, a researcher at the University of Leicester in the United Kingdom, and lead author of a new paper published in the journal Nature Communications, said in a statement. “Instead, we observed the whole auroral region fizzing and popping with light, sometimes varying by the second.”

On Earth, auroras take place when energetic particles from the Sun interact with the planet’s magnetic field and its atmosphere, creating shimmering displays of light across the skies known as the Northern and Southern Lights. Aside from the Sun’s particles, Jupiter has an additional source that creates its auroras. Jupiter’s strong magnetic field grabs charged particles from its surroundings and accelerates them to high speeds. These speedy particles, some of which are thrown into space by Jupiter’s orbiting moon Io, slam into the planet’s atmosphere at high energies and excite the gas, causing it to glow.

Using Webb’s recent observations of Jupiter’s aurora, the scientists studied emissions from a molecule called trihydrogen cation. The special molecule is formed when energetic particles rip an electron off of a hydrogen molecule, and that molecule then reacts with other hydrogen molecules. The study found that the trihydrogen cation emissions are far more variable than they previously believed. Understanding the behavior of the special molecule helps scientists better understand how Jupiter’s atmosphere cools and heats.

The scientists also took images of Jupiter’s auroras with NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope at the same time Webb made its observations, capturing them in ultraviolet light. They uncovered a strange discrepancy between the two sets of data, the brightest light observed by Webb had no real counterpart in the Hubble images.

“This has left us scratching our heads,” Nichols said. “In order to cause the combination of brightness seen by both Webb and Hubble, we need to have a combination of high quantities of very low-energy particles hitting the atmosphere, which was previously thought to be impossible. We still don’t understand how this happens.”

The team plans on carrying out follow-up observations of Jupiter’s auroras using Webb and compare them to data collected by the ongoing Juno mission. The spacecraft has been orbiting the gas giant since 2016, capturing Jupiter and its moons in exquisite detail. Webb previously captured images of Jupiter’s glowing auroras at its north and south poles, providing scientists with a new perspective of the planet’s light display in infrared wavelengths.","Using the telescope’s most recent observations of the gas giant, scientists uncovered a curious discrepancy between how Jupiter’s auroras appear to Webb versus Hubble.

The spacecraft, dubbed Kosmos 482, had orbited the Earth since it launched in March 1972. It followed the Soviet Venera 8 probe and would have most likely been Venera 9 if it weren't for a suspected engine failure that left the lander stranded in orbit around the Earth for more than half a century.

The rocket stage associated with the spacecraft and its main bus reentered Earth's atmosphere decades ago, but the lander remained in orbit until this weekend. Scientists were concerned that since the lander was designed to survive a reentry through the atmosphere of Venus, it might also make it through Earth's atmosphere relatively intact, with its near-500 kg mass impacting the surface at around 240 km/h.

The European Space Agency (ESA) published radar images last week from the Tracking and Imaging Radar (TIRA) at the Fraunhofer Institute for High Frequency Physics and Radar Techniques in Germany that appeared to show the spacecraft tumbling. Kosmos 482 was spotted over Germany at 0804 CEST (0604 UTC) on May 10, but was not detected one orbit later at the expected 0932 CEST (0732 UTC) pass.

Astronomer Jonathan McDowell noted reports from Russia's space agency, Roscosmos, that re-entry was at 0624 UTC over the Indian Ocean, but added that the agency provided ""no details on how they conclude that.""

Roscosmos posted on Telegram, ""According to calculations by specialists from TsNIIMash (part of Roscosmos), the device entered the dense layers of the atmosphere at 9:24 Moscow time, 560 km west of Middle Andaman Island, and fell in the Indian Ocean west of Jakarta.""

ESA said, ""A precise time and location of its reentry have so far not been identified. We have not received any reports on direct visual observations of the final reentry or of any impacts on ground.""

The final fate of the probe is unclear, other than a terse ""the Kosmos-482 spacecraft ceased to exist"" from Roscosmos via a translation service. Since it was tumbling, it seems likely that it burned up – while the probe was built to withstand entry into the atmosphere of Venus, orientation was important. Additionally, the heat shield could have sustained damage or cracked during the probe's stay in orbit.

Company executives said in a May 14 earnings call that three factors contributed to the “landing anomaly” on its IM-2 mission. On that mission the Nova-C lander fell on its side in a crater when it touched down in the south polar region of the moon March 6. The lander was not able to generate sufficient power from its solar panels, leading to an end of the mission barely 12 hours after touchdown.

One factor was an issue the company previously discussed with the lander’s laser altimeters. Steve Altemus, chief executive of Intuitive Machines, said there was “signal noise and distortion” from the altimeters during the lander’s final descent “that did not allow for accurate altitude readings.”

A second factor was conditions at the south polar region of the moon, where low sun angles cause long shadows that “challenged the precision capability of our landing system.” A third, related factor, is that craters appeared differently at lower altitudes, given those lighting conditions, than they did in reference images from NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, affecting the lander’s optical navigation system.

Altemus said the company is incorporating the lessons learned from IM-2 into its next lander mission, IM-3, scheduled for next year. That lander will include dissimilar and redundant altimeters, which will go through more “flight-like” testing ahead of launch. The lander will also have a new lighting-independent sensor to measure surface velocity, and will have an enhanced crater database for improved optical navigation.

Those changes, he said, will not delay the mission. There will be a “slight” increase in cost because of the additional sensors, but he did not quantify the increase.

Altemus said the company is in negotiations with NASA and other customers on the IM-2 mission about up to $14 million in success payments. Some of the payloads were able to carry out limited tests on the moon: a NASA drill, for example, was able to test its mechanisms but was not able to drill into the lunar surface as planned. Altemus said the company wants to complete those negotiations by the end of the quarter or early the following quarter.

Diversification and Artemis changes

Intuitive Machines emphasized in the earnings call its efforts to diversify beyond lunar lander. Altemus highlighted efforts such as design of an orbital transfer vehicle based on the Nova-C lander being done with an unnamed government customers, as well as ongoing work with the Air Force Research Lab’s JETSON project for a spacecraft that uses nuclear electric propulsion.

The company also won in February a $10 million grant from the Texas Space Commission to support work on a lifting body reentry vehicle. Intuitive Machines is working with Rhodium Scientific on ways the vehicle could be used to conduct microgravity research, returning biomedical or other experiments to Earth.

“This diversification and execution builds on our core strengths and positions us as a broader infrastructure and data services provider across the space economy,” he said.

That diversification comes as NASA’s approach to lunar exploration faces potential major changes. The administration’s fiscal year 2026 budget proposal would cancel the lunar Gateway and phase out the Space Launch System and Orion after the Artemis 3 mission, replacing those vehicles with commercial capabilities.

Altemus said Intuitive Machines does not expect any near-term impacts of those changes on programs like Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS), the primary customer of the company’s first lunar lander missions, or the Lunar Terrain Vehicle (LTV) Services program to develop a commercially provided rover for later Artemis crewed missions.

“We do not see a direct impact into the CLPS budget,” he said, with the agency expected to award two task orders for missions later this year. Likewise, he said NASA has not signaled any plans to delay the selection in November of a company to develop the LTV as Intuitive Machines and two competitors, Astrolab and Lunar Outpost, complete preliminary design reviews under awards NASA made last April.

One potential change, he said, may be in the awards made in that next phase. NASA previously stated it planned to select just one of the three companies for funding to develop the LTV. The agency is considering a scenario where it may also select a second company to advance their rover design through a critical design review.

Changes to the overall Artemis architecture, he said, could create new opportunities for the company. He mentioned testimony he and executives of other lunar lander developers gave to the House Science Committee’s space subcommittee in April, where they called for an expansion of the CLPS program. That included more frequent missions and larger landers, along with bulk buys of missions.

“With the reformulation of Artemis, there’s a place for heavy cargo delivery to put infrastructure on the surface of the moon,” he said, along with commercial communications and navigation networks. “We’re playing right into that reformulation with these capabilities.”

Intuitive Machines reported $62.5 million in revenue in the first quarter of 2025, a 14% increase from the fourth quarter of 2024. The company reported an adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) loss of $6.6 million in the quarter, although the company said it was on track for positive “run-rate” adjusted EBITDA by the end of the year.","WASHINGTON — Problems with laser altimeters along with lighting and terrain challenges caused Intuitive Machines’ second lunar lander to fall on its side when it landed on the moon in March.

These high-speed interactions trigger electromagnetic processes that occasionally eject three protons, yielding gold atoms. Billions are made, but only for a split second.

Lead to Gold: A Modern Alchemical Feat at CERN

In a newly published study in Physical Review Journals, scientists from CERN’s ALICE experiment have observed something extraordinary: the transformation of lead into gold inside the powerful Large Hadron Collider (LHC).

For centuries, alchemists dreamed of turning lead into gold. Known as chrysopoeia, this ancient quest was based on the idea that both metals were heavy and shared similar properties. Of course, we now know that lead and gold are completely different elements, and no chemical process can turn one into the other.

A New Kind of Alchemy—Powered by Physics

In the 20th century, nuclear physics revealed that atoms could change from one element into another. This could happen naturally through radioactive decay or be triggered in laboratories using high-energy particles like neutrons or protons. Gold has been made this way before, but now, the ALICE team has measured a completely new method of element-changing magic—this time using near misses between high-speed lead atoms.

When two lead nuclei race through the LHC at nearly the speed of light, they sometimes just miss each other. Instead of colliding head-on, they pass close enough to trigger intense electromagnetic forces. These interactions can generate bursts of energy that change the very identity of atomic nuclei, including turning lead into gold.

Photon Bursts and Nuclear Shifts

The electromagnetic field emanating from a lead nucleus is particularly strong because the nucleus contains 82 protons, each carrying one elementary charge. Moreover, the very high speed at which lead nuclei travel in the LHC (corresponding to 99.999993% of the speed of light) causes the electromagnetic field lines to be squashed into a thin pancake, transverse to the direction of motion, producing a short-lived pulse of photons. Often, this triggers a process called electromagnetic dissociation, whereby a photon interacting with a nucleus can excite oscillations of its internal structure, resulting in the ejection of small numbers of neutrons and protons. To create gold (a nucleus containing 79 protons), three protons must be removed from a lead nucleus in the LHC beams.

“It is impressive to see that our detectors can handle head-on collisions producing thousands of particles, while also being sensitive to collisions where only a few particles are produced at a time, enabling the study of electromagnetic ‘nuclear transmutation’ processes,” says Marco Van Leeuwen, ALICE spokesperson.

Counting Gold Atoms in the Particle Smash

The ALICE team used the detector’s zero degree calorimeters (ZDC) to count the number of photon–nucleus interactions that resulted in the emission of zero, one, two and three protons accompanied by at least one neutron, which are associated with the production of lead, thallium, mercury and gold, respectively. While less frequent than the creation of thallium or mercury, the results show that the LHC currently produces gold at a maximum rate of about 89,000 nuclei per second from lead–lead collisions at the ALICE collision point. Gold nuclei emerge from the collision with very high energy and hit the LHC beam pipe or collimators at various points downstream, where they immediately fragment into single protons, neutrons, and other particles. The gold exists for just a tiny fraction of a second.

A Fleeting Treasure: Billion Gold Atoms, But No Jewelry

The ALICE analysis shows that, during Run 2 of the LHC (2015–2018), about 86 billion gold nuclei were created at the four major experiments. In terms of mass, this corresponds to just 29 picograms (2.9 ×10-11 g). Since the luminosity in the LHC is continually increasing thanks to regular upgrades to the machines, Run 3 has produced almost double the amount of gold that Run 2 did, but the total still amounts to trillions of times less than would be required to make a piece of jewellery. While the dream of medieval alchemists has technically come true, their hopes of riches have once again been dashed.

Beyond Gold: Improving Collider Physics

“Thanks to the unique capabilities of the ALICE ZDCs, the present analysis is the first to systematically detect and analyse the signature of gold production at the LHC experimentally,” says Uliana Dmitrieva of the ALICE collaboration.

“The results also test and improve theoretical models of electromagnetic dissociation, which, beyond their intrinsic physics interest, are used to understand and predict beam losses that are a major limit on the performance of the LHC and future colliders,” adds John Jowett, also of the ALICE collaboration.

NASA's Europa Clipper spacecraft, en route to Jupiter's icy ocean moon Europa, recently captured a ghostly infrared portrait of Mars — a cosmic photo op that helped scientists fine-tune an instrument destined to investigate whether Europa can support life as we know it.

The image, a blurry composite of more than a thousand grayscale snapshots later colorized by scientists, was taken during a precision flyby of Mars on March 1, 2025. At its closest point, the spacecraft skimmed just 550 miles (884 kilometers) above the Martian surface, in a maneuver known as a gravity assist, which used the Red Planet's gravitational pull to slow the spacecraft and adjust its orbit around the sun ahead of a crucial leg of its nearly 2-billion-mile (3.2 billion km) journey to Jupiter .

The brief encounter also served a scientific purpose: It gave the mission team a chance to test the spacecraft's instruments in deep space, including the thermal imager E-THEMIS (short for Europa Thermal Imaging System), which will eventually scan Europa's surface for signs of recent or ongoing geologic activity. Over an 18-minute span on March 1, the instrument took over 1,000 grayscale images — one per second — which began arriving on Earth on May 5, according to a NASA statement .

To confirm the instrument's accuracy, the mission team compared the new infrared imagery with long-term thermal maps of Mars gathered by NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter, which has been observing the Red Planet since 2001. The Odyssey team even coordinated observations before, during, and after the Europa Clipper flyby to allow for a direct side-by-side comparison, according to the statement.

""We wanted no surprises in these new images,"" Phil Christensen, a professor of earth and space exploration at Arizona State University who serves as the principal investigator of the E-THEMIS instrument, said in the statement. ""The goal was to capture imagery of a planetary body we know extraordinarily well and make sure the dataset looks exactly the way it should, based on 20 years of instruments documenting Mars.""

E-THEMIS detects infrared light — essentially heat — allowing scientists to map temperatures across a planetary surface. After the spacecraft reaches the Jupiter system in 2030, these thermal scans will help identify hotspots that could point to recent geologic activity beneath Europa's icy shell, according to the statement.

Infrared imaging will also help pinpoint where Europa's vast subsurface ocean might lie closest to the surface, scientists say. The moon is etched with ridges and fractures, features that scientists suspect result from oceanic forces — like rising water or convection currents — pulling apart the ice from below.

""We want to measure the temperature of those features,"" Christensen said. If Europa is active, its fractures could be warmer than surrounding ice — especially where the ocean lies near the surface or past eruptions left lingering heat, he added.

The Mars flyby also marked the first full in-flight test of Clipper's radar instrument, which couldn't be tested in its entirety on Earth due to the size of its antennas. Preliminary telemetry suggests the test was successful, with detailed analysis of the data still to come, the statement read.","This infrared image of Mars, captured during a close flyby on March 1, 2025, helped NASA validate key instruments aboard the Europa Clipper probe ahead of its mission to Jupiter's icy ocean moon Europa.

The landing occurred on Dec. 16, 2020 in the Siziwang Banner of Inner Mongolia.

A tiny glass bead retrieved by China's Chang'e-5 lunar mission is offering scientists a glimpse into the moon's hidden depths and providing insight into the violent forces that helped shape the cratered landscape.

The bead, just a fraction of an inch wide, was among the 3.7-pound (1.7-kilogram) cache of rock and soil collected by the Chang'e-5 lander in 2020 from Oceanus Procellarum, or the ""Ocean of Storms,"" a vast lava plain on the moon's near side.

Scientists analyzing the samples have identified the glass bead as a remnant of high-temperature lunar activity dating back to roughly 68 million years ago. What sets the bead apart is its unusual chemistry: it's exceptionally rich in magnesium oxide, in stark contrast to the volcanic rocks that dominate the region, a team of scientists led by Chen-Long Ding of Nanjing University in China report in a new study.

The findings suggest the bead likely formed from material excavated by a massive asteroid impact — possibly one that struck the moon with enough force to unearth rock from the upper mantle and fling it to the surface.

""This is a big step forward in understanding how the moon evolved internally,"" Tim Johnson, a professor of geology at Curtin University in Australia and a co-author of the new study, said in a statement . ""If these samples really are pieces of the mantle, it tells us that impacts can excavate otherwise inaccessible mantle material to the surface.""

The plateau surrounding Chang'e-5's landing site is dotted with over 100,000 craters larger than 328 feet (100 meters) in size, making it a challenge for scientists to match glass droplets with their specific crater of origin.

One particularly compelling theory links the bead's origin to the nearby Imbrium Basin, a massive impact site that formed nearly 4 billion years ago. Remote sensing has shown the area around the basin's edge contains minerals that match the chemical signature of the glass bead.

That basin's formation — one of the most cataclysmic in the moon's history — may have punched deep into the lunar crust, excavating material from the upper mantle and scattering it across the surface, including the area later sampled by the Chang'e-5 mission. Billions of years later, a smaller impact — occurring around 68 million years ago — likely struck this area again, re-melting some of that ancient, mantle-derived debris. The intense heat from this second collision fused the material into glass, forming glass beads like the one studied.

""This is exciting, because we've never sampled the mantle directly before,"" Alexander Nemchin, a professor of applied geology at Curtin University said in the same statement. ""The tiny glass beads offer us a glimpse of the moon's hidden interior.""

China recently opened access to its Chang'e-5 lunar samples, which are the first to be brought to Earth since the Soviet Union's Luna 24 mission in 1976. Seven institutions across six countries have been loaned small portions of the material, including two in the U.S. and one each in France, Germany, Japan and Pakistan.

Chinese researchers, in collaboration with international teams, have already made several discoveries from the samples, including the surprising finding that the material is much younger than that from the Apollo missions , suggesting volcanic activity on the moon occurred as recently as 120 million years ago. This raises the question of what fueled the volcanism in the absence of water and hot radioactive elements to generate subsurface magma. Foreign scientists now receiving samples are optimistic their specialized equipment will help answer this and other lunar mysteries.

The filament, a long, dark ribbon of solar plasma suspended by magnetic fields, had been hanging above the sun's surface before destabilizing.

""WOW! There is an absolutely enormous filament erupting right now! It dwarfs all the filament eruptions we have seen recently,"" aurora chaser Jure Atanackov wrote in a post on X.

These filament structures are cooler and denser than their surroundings, making them appear as dark threads against the bright solar disk. When a filament erupts, it can trigger a coronal mass ejection (CME), hurling a vast plume of plasma and magnetic field into space. And this particular filament did just that.

""What a spectacular CME from the huge filament eruption earlier today! Unfortunately, it is directed north and will miss us. A direct hit from a CME like this can be high-end G4 storm material, maybe even G5,"" Atanackov wrote in a later post on X.

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:

Flamingos standing serenely in a shallow alkaline lake with heads submerged may seem to be placidly feeding, but there's a lot going on under the surface.

Through studies of Chilean flamingos in the Nashville Zoo and analysis of 3D printed models of their feet and L-shaped bills, researchers have documented how the birds use their feet, heads and beaks to create a storm of swirling tornados, or vortices, in the water to efficiently concentrate and slurp up their prey.

""Flamingos are actually predators, they are actively looking for animals that are moving in the water, and the problem they face is how to concentrate these animals, to pull them together and feed,"" said Victor Ortega Jiménez, an assistant professor of integrative biology at the University of California, Berkeley, who specializes in biomechanics. ""Think of spiders, which produce webs to trap insects. Flamingos are using vortices to trap animals, like brine shrimp.""

Ortega Jiménez and collaborators at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta; Kennesaw State University in Marietta, Georgia (KSU-Marietta); and the Nashville Zoo have published their findings this week in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

The researchers found that flamingos use their floppy webbed feet to churn up the bottom sediment and propel it forward in whorls that the birds then draw to the surface by jerking their heads upward like plungers, creating mini tornados. All the while, the birds' heads remain upside down within the watery vortex, their angled beaks chattering to create smaller vortices that direct the sediment and food into their mouths, where it's strained out.

The beak of a flamingo is unique in being flattened on the angled front end, so that when the bird's head is upside down in the water, the flat portion is parallel to the bottom. This allows the flamingo to employ another technique called skimming. This involves using its long, S-shaped neck to push its head forward while rapidly clapping its beak, creating sheet-like vortices—von Kármán vortices—that trap prey.

This suite of active feeding behaviors belie the flamingo's reputation as a passive filter feeder, Ortega Jiménez said.

""It seems like they are filtering just passive particles, but no, these animals are actually taking animals that are moving,"" he said.

The principles he discovered could be used to design better systems for concentrating and sucking up tiny particles, such as microplastics, from water; better self-cleaning filters, based on chattering; or robots that, like flamingos, can walk and run in mud.

Chattering

Ortega Jiménez, a native of Puebla, Mexico, became fascinated with the feeding behavior of flamingos during a visit to Zoo Atlanta with his wife and daughter before the COVID-19 pandemic. Filming the birds' feeding behavior, he observed only ripples on the surface.

""We don't know anything about what is happening inside. That was my question,"" he said.

At the time, a postdoctoral fellow at Kennesaw State University in Georgia, Ortega Jiménez focused on flamingo feeding as his next research project. He views himself, he said, as a modern-day Darwinian naturalist, investigating the behavior of animals of all types, from nematodes and flies to springtails and birds, focusing on how the animals interact with and manipulate their surroundings, including air, water and electromagnetic fields.

From Kennesaw State, he moved to the Georgia Institute of Technology to work in the lab of Saad Bhamla, where he collaborated with engineers, and they gained access to Chilean flamingos at the Nashville Zoo. The team filmed them feeding in a large tray, using a laser to illuminate gas bubbles in the water in order to see the vortices created by the heads and beaks of the animals.

After moving to the University of Maine in Orono as an assistant professor, Ortega Jiménez refined 3D printed models of a flamingo beak and foot to study more precisely the movement of water and particles during the beak clapping, or ""chattering,"" that the birds use when eating.

In 2024, he moved again, to UC Berkeley, where he conducted experiments to see how effective the chattering and foot stomping was in capturing live brine shrimp. The new paper summarizes all of this collaborative work.

At UC Berkeley, he attached a real flamingo beak to an actuator to simulate chattering and added a small pump in the mouth to simulate the tongue and suck up the brine shrimp captured by the mouth. With this setup, he was able to establish that chattering is key to flamingo feeding.

""The chattering actually is increasing seven times the number of brine shrimp passing through the tube,"" he said. ""So it's clear that the chattering is enhancing the number of individuals that are captured by the beak.""

Stomp dancing

The feeding behavior begins with the feet, Ortega Jiménez said. If you look at a flamingo in very shallow water, you can often see its dancing-in-place or circular dancing behavior.

The feet are webbed, but as with many wading birds, they are floppy, so that when the bird lifts a foot, the webbing collapses and comes away from the bottom without the suction that makes it hard for humans to walk in mud. When walking or running, flamingos seem to slide their feet into the water instead of stomping, a technique that could help robots walk in water or mud.

Ortega Jiménez created models of both rigid and flexible flamingo feet to compare how the two designs affect fluid flow, and he found that the floppy feet are much more effective at pushing vortices of sediment out in front of each step. Rigid webbing primarily produces turbulence.

Creating a 3D model of the L-shaped beak, he was able to show that pulling the head straight upward in the water creates a vortex swirling around a vertical axis, again concentrating particles of food. He measured the head speed at about 40 centimeters per second (1.3 feet per second). The small tornados were strong enough to entrap even agile invertebrates, such as brine shrimp and the microscopic crustaceans called copepods.

Chattering also creates vortices around the beak. In this case, the flamingo keeps its upper beak stationary, though it is capable of independent motion, and moves only the lower beak—about 12 times per second during chattering, Ortega Jiménez discovered.

Tien Yee, a co-author of the paper and a professor at KSU-Marrieta, employed computational fluid dynamics to simulate on a computer the 3D flow around the beak and the feet. He confirmed that the vortices do indeed concentrate particles, similar to experiments using a 3D-printed head in a flume with both actively swimming brine shrimp and passively floating brine shrimp eggs.

""We observed when we put a 3D printed model in a flume to mimic what we call skimming, they are producing symmetrical vortices on the sides of the beak that recirculate the particles in the water so they actually get into the beak,"" Ortega Jiménez said. ""It's this trick of fluid dynamics.""

His next projects are to determine the role of the flamingo's piston-like tongue and how the comb-like edges of the beak filter prey out of briny and sometimes toxic water.

""Flamingos are super-specialized animals for filter feeding,"" he said. ""It's not just the head, but the neck, their legs, their feet and all the behaviors they use just to effectively capture these tiny and agile organisms.""

In addition to Yee, other co-authors of the paper are postdoctoral fellow Pankaj Rohilla, graduate student Benjamin Seleb and Professor Saad Bhamla at Georgia Tech; and Jake Belair of the Nashville Zoo in Tennessee.

There might be a hidden ocean's worth of liquid water below the surface of Mars , seismic evidence suggests.

According to a new paper published April 25 in the journal National Science Review , recordings of seismic waves from deep within the Red Planet indicate that a layer of liquid water may be lurking in the Martian rocks between 3.4 and 5 miles [5.4 to 8 kilometers] below the surface.

The total volume of hidden water could flood the whole of Mars' surface with an ocean 1,700 to 2,560 feet [520 to 780 metres] deep, around the same volume of liquid that is contained within Antarctica's ice sheet, the study authors estimated.

Our neighboring planet was once abundant in water. In the time between Mars' formation 4.1 billion years ago to about 3 billion years ago, the Red Planet is thought to have been extremely wet, with features like valley networks, delta formations, and layered sedimentary rocks suggesting sustained water flow .

However, this abundant liquid water ""vanished as the planet transitioned to become the cold, dry environment we see today,"" paper co-author Hrvoje Tkalčić , a professor of geophysics at the Australian National University, said in a statement.

Over time, Mars lost its magnetic field, and solar radiation began stripping away its atmosphere. With a thinner atmosphere, surface temperatures dropped; the planet's liquid water began to escape into space, become trapped as ice in the subsurface or polar caps, or become locked in hydrated minerals within the planet's crust, the researchers said.

However, these methods of water loss have previously been shown to not entirely account for all the water that is estimated to have once flowed on the Red Planet, with a large volume of ""missing"" water going unaccounted for. This conundrum has long puzzled scientists, posing the question of whether there is still liquid water hidden on Mars that we have yet to find.

This new research suggests that there is indeed liquid water buried deep below the surface of the planet. Upon analyzing seismic data from NASA's InSight lander, which landed on Mars in 2018 , researchers found that seismic waves within the planet's interior — caused by asteroid impacts and marsquakes in 2021 and 2022 — appeared to slow down between 3.4 and 5 miles [5.4 to 8 kilometers] below the surface. They suggest that this could be due to the presence of liquid water hidden within porous rocks, as seismic waves travel more slowly through liquid than they do through more solid materials.

""This 'low-velocity layer' is most likely highly porous rock filled with liquid water, like a saturated sponge,"" Tkalčić and another study co-author Weijia Sun , a professor of geophysics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, explained in an essay for the Conversation about the new study. ""Something like Earth's aquifers, where groundwater seeps into rock pores.""

The researchers suggest that this liquid water could make up the total volume of water missing from previous calculations.

""Our study indicates it's possible that much of that ancient water percolated through the porous surface rocks and was retained underground,"" Tkalčić said. ""This also matches estimates of the 'missing' water on Mars from other studies.""

Previous studies have also found that large volumes of water may be stored beneath the Martian surface in ice form , and a study from 2024 suggested that liquid water could be stored within rocks between 7 to 13 miles (11.2 to 21 km) beneath the surface.

The potential presence of liquid water on Mars is exciting to scientists, as liquid water is essential to life as we know it. While these potential reservoirs deep below the planet's surface could host some form of Martian life, we won't know if the liquid water even exists until we can drill deep into Mars and find it for ourselves.

""Future missions with seismometers and drills are needed to confirm the presence of the water at these depths and gather more clues,"" Tkalčić said.","NASA has found evidence of Mars' water escaping into space — but new research hints that it may have also gone deep, deep underground.

As global warming causes sea ice in the polar regions to melt, it is not just the amount of sunlight entering the ocean that changes. The color of the underwater light shifts, too, and this has major consequences for life below the surface.

According to new research published in Nature Communications, these changes could significantly impact tiny but vital organisms like ice algae and phytoplankton. The study was led by marine biologists Monika Soja-Woźniak and Jef Huisman from the University of Amsterdam’s Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics.

The international team of scientists, which included physical chemist Sander Woutersen and collaborators from the Netherlands and Denmark, explored how melting sea ice transforms the underwater light environment. Light behaves very differently in sea ice compared to open water.

Sea ice reflects and scatters most sunlight, letting only a small amount through, but that small amount includes nearly all visible wavelengths. Open seawater, on the other hand, absorbs reds and greens, while allowing blue light to travel deeper. This is why the ocean appears blue to our eyes.

Molecular vibrations of water

Another key difference between ice and liquid water lies in the role of molecular vibrations. In liquid water, H₂O molecules are free to move and vibrate, which leads to the formation of distinct absorption bands at specific wavelengths. These bands selectively remove portions of the light spectrum, creating gaps in the light available for photosynthesis.

Previous research by Maayke Stomp and Prof. Huisman demonstrated that these molecular absorption features create ‘spectral niches’—distinct sets of wavelengths available for photosynthetic organisms. Phytoplankton and cyanobacteria have evolved a diversity of pigments tuned to the different spectral niches, shaping their global distribution across oceans, coastal waters, and lakes.

In ice, however, water molecules are locked into a rigid crystal lattice. This fixed structure suppresses their ability for molecular vibrations and thereby alters their absorption features. As a consequence, ice lacks the absorption bands of liquid water, and hence a broader spectrum of light is preserved under sea ice. This fundamental difference plays a key role in the spectral shift that occurs as sea ice melts.

Ecological implications

As sea ice disappears and gives way to open water, the underwater light environment shifts from a broad spectrum of colors to a narrower, blue-dominated spectrum. This spectral change is crucial for photosynthesis.

“The photosynthetic pigments of algae living under sea ice are adapted to make optimal use of the wide range of colors present in the little amount of light passing through ice and snow,” says lead author Monika Soja-Woźniak. “When the ice melts, these organisms suddenly find themselves in a blue-dominated environment, which provides a lesser fit for their pigments.”

Using optical models and spectral measurements, the researchers showed that this shift in light color not only alters photosynthetic performance, but may also lead to changes in species composition. Algal species specialized in blue light may gain a strong competitive advantage in comparison to ice algae.

According to Prof. Huisman, these changes can have cascading ecological effects. “Photosynthetic algae form the foundation of the Arctic food web. Changes in their productivity or species composition can ripple upward to affect fish, seabirds, and marine mammals. Moreover, photosynthesis plays an important role in natural CO 2 uptake by the ocean.”

The study highlights that climate change in the polar regions does more than melt ice—it causes fundamental shifts in key processes such as light transmission and energy flow in marine ecosystems.

The results underscore the importance of incorporating light spectra and photosynthesis more explicitly in climate models and ocean forecasts, especially in polar regions where environmental change is accelerating at an unprecedented rate.

Researchers have successfully produced the world’s most powerful ultrashort electron beam, shattering previous records with a peak current five times greater than existing similar beams. This remarkable breakthrough promises to revolutionize multiple scientific fields and cement America’s position at the forefront of global research innovation.

Record-breaking electron beam technology transforms scientific research

The SLAC team’s achievement, detailed in a February 2025 publication in Physical Review Letters, represents a quantum leap in particle acceleration technology. Lead researcher Claudio Emma emphasized the dual significance of their accomplishment: “We’ve not only generated an incredibly powerful beam but can control it with unprecedented precision, enabling exploration of previously unobservable physical and chemical phenomena.”

Unlike laser beams which consist of photons, electron beams comprise accelerated electrons directed along a specific path using electromagnetic fields. These particle beams must operate in vacuum conditions to prevent energy dissipation and require highly sophisticated equipment to generate and maintain. This technological distinction is crucial as electron beams interact with matter in fundamentally different ways than lasers, opening unique research opportunities.

The FACET-II facility at SLAC now holds the world’s top position for electron beam power, surpassing Germany’s European XFEL and other leading installations. This achievement comes as China accelerates development of its massive nuclear fusion center, highlighting the ongoing global competition in advanced scientific infrastructure.

Breaking the power-quality compromise with innovative techniques

One of the most significant challenges in accelerator physics has long been increasing electron beam power while maintaining beam quality. Traditionally, as beams became more compressed and powerful, they would deteriorate due to radiation emitted during acceleration—creating an apparently insurmountable trade-off.

The SLAC research team overcame this limitation through clever adaptation of free-electron laser techniques originally developed for the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS). Rather than using conventional electromagnetic fields, they implemented precise laser-based energy modulation to compress billions of electrons into a space smaller than a micrometer.

“Laser-based modulation offers dramatically improved precision compared to traditional electromagnetic approaches,” Emma explained. The implementation process involved shaping the beam within the first ten meters of a kilometer-long machine, then transporting it without losing modulation before final compression—an enormous technical challenge requiring months of meticulous adjustments.

This breakthrough comes amid other significant American advances in space science, including recent James Webb Telescope observations of the galactic center black hole revealing unexpected phenomena.

Applications spanning from astrophysics to quantum chemistry

The ultra-powerful electron beam enables scientists to investigate physical phenomena previously beyond experimental reach. Astrophysicists can now recreate plasma filaments observed in stars under laboratory conditions, testing theories about their formation and evolution in realistic settings for the first time.

Researchers at FACET-II have already utilized this breakthrough to advance plasma wakefield acceleration technology, a promising avenue for developing next-generation particle accelerators. This technology could eventually lead to more compact and efficient accelerators, potentially transforming how research facilities are designed and built.

Emma’s team intends to push boundaries further by compressing these beams to produce attosecond-scale light pulses (one billionth of a billionth of a second). Such advancement would essentially create an ultra-high-speed camera capable of capturing fleeting phenomena at unprecedented timescales, providing complementary investigation tools: electron beams for matter observation and light beams for capturing ultra-fine details.

While China makes strides in quantum computing technology, the SLAC breakthrough demonstrates continued American excellence in fundamental physics research. Scientists worldwide are now invited to test their research ideas using this new capability, with Emma extending an open invitation: “If you need an extreme beam, we have what you need. Let’s work together!”

Future horizons for American scientific leadership

The SLAC achievement positions the United States to maintain its scientific leadership role despite increasing global competition. This breakthrough follows other recent American achievements in space exploration, including NASA’s history-changing discoveries on Mars.

The implications extend beyond academic research into potential industrial applications. Electron beams already serve critical roles in various sectors—from electron microscopy and precision welding to semiconductor lithography and medical equipment sterilization. This new capability could transform these fields through higher precision, efficiency, and capabilities.

The technical expertise developed through this project also strengthens America’s scientific workforce, training a new generation of physicists and engineers in cutting-edge accelerator technology. This human capital represents a crucial component of long-term research competitiveness.

As astronomers prepare to potentially reveal our solar system’s ninth planet using advanced telescope technology, this electron beam breakthrough demonstrates how America continues pushing scientific boundaries across multiple disciplines. The SLAC achievement reinforces the United States’ commitment to maintaining its position at the forefront of global scientific innovation through sustained investment in facilities, talent, and fundamental research.","Researchers have successfully produced the world’s most powerful ultrashort electron beam, shattering previous records with a peak current five times greater than existing similar beams.

Set to launch in just two years, Roman is poised to transform our understanding of exoplanets and the structure of the universe. Like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), it can detect both visible and infrared light — wavelengths longer than what our eyes can see. But Roman is fundamentally different in one key way: its much larger field of view. It can observe enormous swaths of the sky at once using its wide field instrument. That makes it capable of science that no other existing observatory can do, including JWST. And if it is killed, we will miss out on a generation of new scientific discoveries.

Before a telescope launches — before the headlines, the press releases and the breathtaking images — it’s hard to appreciate just how transformative it might be. The Hubble Space Telescope, for example, was built to do general astrophysics along with a handful of specific science goals, such as measuring the universe’s expansion. It not only fulfilled those aims but went on to revolutionize modern astronomy in ways no one could have fully predicted. Remarkably, Hubble launched before the first exoplanets had even been discovered. Yet once they were, Hubble became one of our most powerful tools for studying their atmospheres. JWST is already following in its footsteps.

Roman was similarly designed with a focused set of science goals, including exploring an uncharted region of exoplanet discovery space and investigating the nature of dark energy. However, since those original goals were laid out, scientists have developed a wide array of new ideas for what it could do. NASA’s website outlines Roman’s planned science — remarkable in its own right — but the telescope’s true potential extends far beyond what’s described there. Like Hubble and JWST, Roman will almost certainly uncover discoveries we don’t yet know to look for — things we haven’t yet imagined. The public rarely hears about that broader realm of possibility. In this piece, I want to spotlight just a few of those ideas — drawn from my own area of expertise: the search for moons and rings beyond our solar system. They represent just one small sliver of Roman’s enormous discovery potential beyond its already extraordinary core mission.

One of Roman’s primary missions is a microlensing survey that will detect about 2,500 exoplanets, ranging from rocky worlds like Earth to massive gas giants like Jupiter. These planets will orbit much farther from their host stars — at distances similar to those between Earth and the Sun, or even Saturn and the Sun — regions that have remained largely out of reach for current detection methods. This is a critical blind spot: almost all known exoplanets have been found using the transit or radial velocity methods, which are most sensitive to planets that orbit close to their stars. Roman will give us, for the first time, a full picture of the architecture of planetary systems, especially in their outer reaches.

In addition to those 2,500 microlensing detections, the same survey is expected to inadvertently detect thousands of transiting exoplanets. These discoveries will allow us to map how planet populations vary across our galaxy.

That alone would be revolutionary. But Roman is also uniquely capable of detecting something we’ve never conclusively observed before: exomoons.

Right now, not even a single exomoon has been confirmed to be orbiting an exoplanet. Roman may finally change that. Its microlensing survey is sensitive enough to detect moons orbiting free-floating planets — worlds that have been ejected from their home star systems. Simulations suggest that Roman could, for the first time, reveal a population of such moons.

We currently have no way of knowing how unusual Earth’s moon is. And yet, our moon may have played a crucial role in stabilizing Earth’s climate — its gravitational influence helps prevent chaotic swings in the planet’s tilt. That kind of stability could be important for making planets habitable. Moons are therefore predicted to have a significant influence on the long term climate and habitability of rocky planets. Roman’s microlensing survey could detect moons like ours around free-floating earth-sized planets — systems where the planet and moon were ejected together. That would help us answer a profound question: Are moons like Earth’s unusual or common?

Roman could also search for exomoons around young, free-floating giant planets using the transit method. Similar to how the Kepler telescope monitored thousands of stars for dips in light caused by orbiting planets, Roman can continuously observe bright, glowing, young giant planets to search for the transits of orbiting moons. If our current models of moon formation are correct, these surveys could detect around a dozen moons — potentially including ones comparable in size to Saturn’s moon Titan.

Taken together, these methods give Roman the unprecedented ability to not only detect the first confirmed exomoon, but to uncover an entire population — ranging from Earth-moon analogs to terrestrial-sized satellites orbiting giant free-floating planets. No other observatory, current or planned, has this capability. If Roman is cancelled, this potential science disappears with it, and we will remain in the dark about these systems for decades.

All of this science comes from just one of Roman’s instruments. The telescope also includes a second instrument: the Coronagraphic Instrument (CGI), which is designed to directly image exoplanets by blocking the glare of their host stars. This is extremely challenging — stars are billions of times brighter than their planets — but CGI uses cutting-edge technology to suppress the starlight and reveal the much fainter reflected light from planets orbiting the star. For the first time, we could directly observe the light from planets analogous to Jupiter and Saturn in other solar systems. Even more exciting: CGI might detect rings around these planets — rings like Saturn’s, orbiting alien worlds. JWST has already shown that in the infrared, rings and moons can outshine their host planets in some cases.

Roman’s CGI could capture the first direct images of planets orbiting other stars with Saturn-like ring systems. These rings may have formed from moons or small bodies that were torn apart by a planet’s gravity — offering clues about the history and evolution of these systems.

By detecting both exomoons and exorings, Roman would — for the first time — allow us to understand the moons and rings of our own solar system within a broader cosmic context. And this is just one part of Roman’s vast scientific potential. From probing dark energy to unraveling the processes of star and planet formation, Roman is uniquely equipped to tackle some of the biggest questions in astronomy.

We have already invested more than a decade of engineering, preparation and research into building this observatory — and we’re now just two years from launch. If Roman is cancelled now, we don’t just pause a project — we abandon a generation of science. And we close the door on discoveries that would deepen our understanding of the universe and our place in it.

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:

Today, the Argentine black and white tegu is considered an invasive species in Florida, but long before they arrived via the pet trade, their prehistoric ancestors roamed this region. Credit: Kevin Blackwell / Amphibian Foundation

Originally from South America, the charismatic tegu made its way to the United States via the pet trade of the 1990s. After wreaking havoc in Florida's ecosystems, the exotic lizard was classified as an invasive species. But a recent discovery from the Florida Museum of Natural History reveals the reptiles are no strangers to the region—tegus were here millions of years before their modern relatives arrived in pet carriers.

Described in a study in the Journal of Paleontology, this breakthrough came from a single, half-inch-wide vertebra fossil that was unearthed in the early 2000s and puzzled scientists for the next 20 years. Jason Bourque, now a fossil preparator in the museum's vertebrate paleontology division, came across the peculiar fossil in the museum's collection when he was freshly out of graduate school.

""We have all these mystery boxes of fossil bones, so I was digging through, and I kept coming across this one vertebra,"" Bourque said. ""I could not figure out what it was. I put it away for a while. Then I'd come back and say, Is it a lizard? Is it a snake? In the back of my mind for years and years, it just sat there.""

The vertebra had been found in a fuller's earth clay mine just north of the Florida border, after a tipoff from the local work crew prompted a visit from the museum's paleontologists. There was just one catch: The mine was slated to close, and its quarry, along with any exposed fossils, would soon be filled in. Working against a deadline, the scientists excavated as many fossils as they could and brought them back to the museum, where the vertebra sat in storage, its identity unresolved.

Years later, Bourque stumbled across an image of tegu vertebrae while looking through studies for a new research paper.

""I saw the tegu, and I just knew right away that's what this fossil was,"" Bourque said.

Today, tegus are of particular interest to Florida's wildlife biologists and conservationists. Their bold patterns and docile attitudes make them attractive pets, but that often changes once they reach nearly 5 feet in length and weigh 10 pounds. Exotic pets have a knack for slipping free—or being released—into the wild, where they can take a heavy toll on native ecosystems. This is the case with modern tegus in Florida.

But until this point, there was no record of prehistoric tegus in North America. Bourque needed evidence to back up his revelation. Paleontologists typically work with multiple bones to identify an animal, but Bourque had just a single vertebra. He recruited his colleague, Edward Stanley, director of the museum's digital imaging laboratory, who saw an opportunity to try out a new machine-learning technique—one that doesn't rely on a paleontologist's decades of specialized knowledge.

With a CT scan of the unidentified fossil, Stanley carefully measured and landmarked each bump, hole and furrow of the fossil. Next, he needed vertebrae from other tegus and related lizards for comparison. Fortunately, the team had access to an abundance of specimens thanks to the museum's openVertebrate (oVert) project, a free, online collection of thousands of 3D images of vertebrates.

Instead of measuring these images by hand, Stanley used a technique developed by Arthur Porto, the museum's curator of artificial intelligence for natural history and biodiversity, to automatically recognize and fit the corresponding landmarks onto more than 100 vertebrae images from the database. By comparing the data of all their shapes, he determined the fossil matched the other tegus and pinpointed its original position at the middle of the lizard's spinal column.

While the fossil was unmistakably a tegu vertebra, it wasn't an exact match with any of the specimens in the database. This meant the team had uncovered a new species, which they named Wautaugategu formidus. Wautauga is the name of a forest near the mine where the fossil was discovered. Although the word's origin is unclear, it is thought to mean ""land of the beyond,"" which Bourque and Stanley found fitting for the long-extinct species, that—despite having ancestral ties to South America—ended up in present-day Georgia.

""Formidus,"" a Latin word meaning ""warm,"" alludes to the reason these lizards likely wound up in the southeastern United States in the first place. The fossil is from the Middle Miocene Climatic Optimum, a particularly warm period in Earth's geologic history.

At the time, sea levels were significantly higher than today, and with most of Florida underwater, the historic coastline would have been near the site of the fossil bed. Tegus are terrestrial lizards, but they are strong swimmers. The warm climate may have tempted them to travel from South America into present-day Georgia, but the region did not remain hospitable for long.

""We don't have any record of these lizards before that event, and we don't have any records of them after that event. It seems they were here just for a blip, during that really warm period,"" Bourque said.

The tegus would likely have struggled and ultimately disappeared as global temperatures cooled. Like other egg-laying animals, their reproduction is highly dependent on temperature, and the cold may have limited their ability to produce or hatch eggs.

Finding more tegu fossils may help demystify the prehistoric lizard's brief stint in North America.

""I'm ready to go up to the Panhandle and try to find more fossil sites along the ancient coastal ridge near the Florida-Georgia border,"" Bourque said.

Stanley, meanwhile, hopes the next find won't languish in storage. The combination of 3D modeling and artificial intelligence to identify fossils without relying on decades of specialized knowledge could dramatically speed up the process. With open access to data worldwide, it could even lead to a global database for fossil identification.

""There are boxes full, shelves full, of fossils that are unsorted because it requires a huge amount of expertise to identify these things, and nobody has time to look through them comprehensively,"" Stanley said. ""This is a first step towards some of that automation, and it's very exciting to see where it goes from here.""

Because the moon is relatively close to Earth, its apparent position against the background stars shifts depending on your location. That means the occultation, when the moon covers Antares, won't be visible everywhere.

Instead, skywatchers in a a handful of southern hemisphere countries including Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, and Brazil, will see the full show according to stargazing site in-the-sky.org .

In the U.S., skywatchers will be treated to an altogether different celestial show. On May 13, bright Antares will rise to the left of the waning gibbous moon in the southeastern sky, with just a few degrees of separation between the two celestial bodies. Moonrise will occur at 9:33 p.m. EDT (0133 GMT on May 14) for viewers in New York, for example, who will see Antares glowing to its lower left. As the night progresses, the pair will climb higher, with Antares moving above the moon by the time they set in the early morning hours.

Antares is also known as the ""heart of the scorpion"", owing to its position at the core of the constellation Scorpius. It is about 700 times the diameter of our sun, yet only nine times as massive, according to the European Southern Observatory, giving it a remarkably low density. The star is nearing the end of its life and will eventually explode in a brilliant supernova.

Of course, the moon and Antares won't be the only celestial sights on May 13. The bright star Arcturus will be visible almost directly above the lunar disk at moonrise, while Vega shines in the east and the Big Dipper hovers near the zenith, pointing the way to Polaris.

Mars will appear in the constellation Cancer in the western sky, while Jupiter will lurk close to the horizon, setting just a few hours after the sun.

Many insects can see well in the dark because of their unique array of eyes. These compound eyes are made up of many small units called ommatidia, each with its own tiny lens. Each ommatidium collects light from a different angle, allowing insects to take in information from multiple directions all at once. They also use a process called “temporal summation,” which means they gather light over a short period to create a clearer picture in low light. This gives them fast and highly sensitive vision.

Because their eyes work in parallel, insects can quickly spot and follow moving objects — like prey or threats — even when it’s dark. By collecting light over time, their eyes become more sensitive to low-light environments.

According to a study published in the journal Science Advances, researchers at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) were inspired by the visual structure of insect eyes and developed a camera that works in a similar way.

Designed by a research team led by Professors Ki-Hun Jeong and Min H. Kim, the bio-inspired camera is incredibly thin — less than one millimeter thick — and compact, yet it can record 9,120 FPS and still produce clear images in the dark.

The camera, called the high-speed, high-sensitivity microlens array camera (HS-MAC), mimics the design of insect eyes. Instead of using a single lens to take one picture at a time, it uses many tiny lenses to capture different parts of a scene at different moments. These are then stitched together to produce sharp, clear videos — even in very low light.

“The research team adopted an approach similar to insect vision, utilizing multiple optical channels and temporal summation,” the researchers write in a press release. “Unlike traditional monocular camera systems, the bio-inspired camera employs a compound-eye-like structure that allows for the parallel acquisition of frames from different time intervals.”

According to a report by Interesting Engineering, this parallel acquisition helps the camera gather more light, improving its sensitivity even when capturing fast-moving objects. Rather than capturing each frame entirely separately, the camera records frames with slight temporal overlap. This method allows light to accumulate over time, enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio.

A stronger signal-to-noise ratio means the images are sharper and more accurate, which is particularly important in dim lighting. Interesting Engineering reports that the researchers demonstrated that their camera could detect objects up to 40 times dimmer than what conventional high-speed cameras are capable of seeing.

Their “channel-splitting” method greatly improved the camera’s speed, enabling frame rates that are thousands of times faster than those achievable with typical image sensors used in device manufacturing. To maintain image clarity, the team applied a “compressed image restoration” algorithm that effectively reduces motion blur.

Here's how to get the best views.,"The bright band of the Milky Way is about to make its first great appearance of the year in the Northern Hemisphere.

There are few more impressive sights than the arc of the Milky Way spanning the night sky, but skywatchers don't always know exactly how, when and where to see it. In fact, one-third of humanity — and 80% of Americans — cannot see it .

The reason is light pollution, with the sky's brightness increasing by between 7% and 10% per year between 2011 and 2023, according to a 2023 study published in the journal Science . As a result, if you want to see the Milky Way, you'll need to be as far away from light pollution as possible. Good options include a Dark Sky Place or somewhere that looks dark on a light pollution map .

Although the Milky Way can be seen in some form for about eight months of the year, the galaxy's bright core becomes easier to see — and gets higher in the sky — as of May as seen from midlatitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, which includes the entire continental United States and the most populated parts of Canada.

According to the Milky Way photography website Capture The Atlas , ""Milky Way season"" runs from February to October, usually between midnight and 5 a.m. local time, though your location and the phase of the moon matter a lot. During May, the period between the last quarter moon on May 20 and the new moon on May 30 is the time to look for the Milky Way.

Even if you have a clear, moonless night, the viewing window is further restricted by when the galaxy's bright core rises from your location. The key is to find out when the Summer Triangle — a shape formed by three bright stars — becomes visible. This vast asterism of Deneb in the constellation Cygnus, Vega in Lyra and Altair in Aquila sits across the Milky Way. If it's above the horizon, you have a good chance of spotting it.

The Milky Way will rise higher into the sky — and appear earlier — as the Summer Triangle becomes more prominent in June and July, but a lack of darkness at mid-northern latitudes around the solstice on June 20-21 makes May the best time to grab a first glance before the Milky Way gets much brighter and higher in the sky in August and September.","The bright band of the Milky Way is about to make its first great appearance of the year in the Northern Hemisphere.

Inside a laboratory nestled above the mist of the forests of south Dakota, scientists are searching for the answer to one of science's biggest questions: why does the Universe exist?

They are in a race for the answer with a separate team of Japanese scientists – who are several years ahead.

The current theories of astronomy can't explain why the planets, stars and galaxies came into existence. Both teams are building detectors that study a sub-atomic particle called a neutrino in the hope of finding answers.

US scientists are hoping the answer lies deep underground, in the aptly named Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (Dune).

The scientists travel 1,500 metres below the surface into three vast underground caverns. Such is the scale that construction crews and their bulldozers seem like small plastic toys by comparison.

Dune's science director Dr Jaret Heise describes the giant caves as ""cathedrals to science"".

Dr Heise has been involved the construction of these caverns for nearly ten years. They seal Dune off from the noise and radiation from the world above. Now, Dune is now ready for the next stage.

""We are poised to build the detector that will change our understanding of the Universe with instruments that will be deployed by a collaboration of 1,500 scientists who are eager to answer the question of why we exist,"" he says.

When the Universe was created two kinds of particles were created: matter – from which stars, planets and everything around us are made – and, in equal amounts, antimatter, matter's exact opposite.

Theoretically the two should have cancelled each other out, leaving nothing but a big burst of energy. And yet, here we – as matter – are.

[BBC]

Scientists believe that the answer to understanding why matter won – and we exist – lies in studying a particle called the neutrino and its antimatter opposite, the anti-neutrino.

They will be firing beams of both kinds of particles from deep underground in Illinois to the detectors at South Dakota, 800 miles away.

This is because as they travel, neutrinos and anti-neutrinos change ever so slightly.

The scientists want to find out whether those changes are different for the neutrinos and anti-neutrinos. If they are, it could lead them to the answer of why matter and anti-matter don't cancel each other out.

Dune is an international collaboration, involving 1,400 scientists from thirty countries. Among them is Dr Kate Shaw from Sussex University, who told me that the discoveries in store will be ""transformative"" to our understanding of the Universe and humanity's view of itself.

""It is really exciting that we are here now with the technology, with the engineering, with the computer software skills to really be able to attack these big questions,"" she said.

A temple to science: Japan's new lab will be a bigger better version of its existing Super K neutrino detector [Kamioka/ICRR/Tokyo University]

Half a world away, Japanese scientists are using shining golden globes to search for the same answers. In all their splendour, look like a temple to science. The scientists are building Hyper K - which will be a bigger and better version of their existing neutrino detector, Super K.

The Japanese-led team will be ready to turn on their neutrino beam in less than two years, several years earlier than the American project. Just like Dune, Hyper K is an international collaboration. Dr Mark Scott of Imperial College, London believes his team is in pole position to make one of the biggest ever discoveries about the origin of the Universe.

""We switch on earlier and we have a larger detector, so we should have more sensitivity sooner than Dune,"" he says.

But Dr Linda Cremonesi, of Queen Mary University of London, who works for the US project, says that getting there first may not give the Japanese-led team the full picture of what is really going on.

""There is an element of a race, but Hyper K does not have yet all of the ingredients that they need to understand if neutrinos and anti-neutrinos behave differently"".

That concluded his fourth trip to space — a busy 220 days at the International Space Station.

Like other crew members on the space station, Mr. Pettit conducted experiments, talked with students and exercised for hours to maintain his health and to stave off loss of bone density. But the most eye-catching work he performed in orbit was his photography.

Most people on Earth will never get a chance to go to space. “I could try to give them a glimpse through my imagery,” Mr. Pettit said during a news conference a couple of weeks after his return.

Mr. Pettit noted that hard-core photographers always want to have a camera in hand. “I could look out the window and just enjoy the view,” he said. “But when I’m looking out the window, just enjoying the view, it’s like, ‘Oh, wow, a meteor. Oh, wow. Look at that. Man, there’s a flash there. What’s that?’ And, ‘Oh, look at that, a volcano going off.’ It’s like, ‘OK, where’s my camera? I got to record that.’”

The research team from the University of Surrey notes an ""explosion of formulaic research articles,"" including inappropriate study designs and false discoveries, based on data cribbed from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) nationwide health database.

The study, published in PLOS Biology, a nonprofit publisher of open-access journals, found that many post-2021 papers used ""a superficial and oversimplified approach to analysis."" These often focused on a single variable while ignoring more realistic, multi-factor explanations of links between health conditions and potential causes, along with some cherry-picked narrow data subsets without justification.

""We've seen a surge in papers that look scientific but don't hold up under scrutiny – this is 'science fiction' using national health datasets to masquerade as science fact,"" states Matt Spick, a lecturer in health and biomedical data analytics at Surrey University, and one of the authors of the report.

""The use of these easily accessible datasets via APIs, combined with large language models, is overwhelming some journals and peer reviewers, reducing their ability to assess more meaningful research – and ultimately weakening the quality of science overall,"" he added.

The report notes that AI-ready datasets, such as NHANES, can open up new opportunities for data-driven research, but also lead to the risk of potential data exploitation by what it calls ""paper mills"" – entities that churn out questionable scientific papers, often for paying clients seeking confirmation of an existing belief.

Surrey Uni's work involved a systematic literature search going back ten years to retrieve potentially formulaic papers covering NHANES data, and analyzing these for telltale statistical approaches or study design.

The team identified and retrieved 341 reports published across a number of different journals. It found that over the last three years, there has been a rapid rise in the number of publications analyzing single-factor associations between predictors (independent variables) and various health conditions using the NHANES dataset. An average of four papers per year were published between 2014 and 2021, increasing to 33, 82, and 190 in 2022, 2023, and the first ten months of 2024, respectively.

Also noted is a change in the origins of the published research. From 2014 to 2020, just two out of 25 manuscripts had a primary author affiliation in China. Between 2021 and 2024, this rose to 292 out of 316 manuscripts.

The report says this jump in single-factor associative research means there is a corresponding increase in the risk of misleading findings being introduced to the wider body of scientific literature.

For example, it says that some well-known multifactorial health issues are analyzed as single-factor studies, citing depression, cardiovascular disease, and cognitive function – all recognized as multifactorial – being investigated using simplistic, single-factor approaches in some of the papers reviewed.

To combat this, the team sets out a number of suggestions, including that editors and reviewers at scientific journals should regard single-factor analysis of conditions known to be complex and multifactorial as a ""red flag"" for potentially problematic research.

Providers of datasets should also take steps including API keys and application numbers to prevent data dredging, an approach already used by the UK Biobank, the report says. Publications referencing such data should be made to include an auditable account number as a condition of access.

Another suggestion is that full dataset analysis should be made mandatory, unless using data subsets can be justified.

""We're not trying to block access to data or stop people using AI in their research – we're asking for some common sense checks,"" said Tulsi Suchak, a post-graduate researcher at the University of Surrey and lead author of the study. ""This includes things like being open about how data is used, making sure reviewers with the right expertise are involved, and flagging when a study only looks at one piece of the puzzle.""

This isn't the first time the issue has come to light. Last year, US publishing house Wiley discontinued 19 scientific journals overseen by its Hindawi subsidiary that were publishing reports churned out by AI paper mills.

It is also part of a wider problem of AI-generated content appearing online and in web searches that can be difficult to distinguish from reality. Dubbed ""AI slop,"" this includes fake pictures and entire video sequences of celebrities and world leaders, but also fake historical photographs and AI-generated portraits of historical figures appearing in search results as if they were genuine.

According to newly published research, clues to the formation of a mountain range the size of the Alps tucked away below Antarctic ice are being revealed, offering geologists a unique glimpse at the processes behind their formation.

The Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains, initially discovered by Soviet scientists during an expedition in 1958, have puzzled researchers for decades. Now, these massive features beneath Antarctica’s frozen surface, which were formed long ago during the birth of the supercontinent Gondwana, are finally revealing their secrets, as reported in a new study that sheds new light on the geological forces that helped to shape and ultimately stabilize the heart of Earth’s southernmost continent.

Secrets Below Antarctic Ice

While many of Antarctica’s mountain ranges are only partially covered by the thick ice that shields the continent, the Gamburtsev Mountains remain entirely concealed beneath the highest part of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet.

Soviet scientists first reported the discovery of these mountains using seismic techniques during a 1958 expedition. This expedition revealed an extensive mountain range comparable to the European Alps, albeit one that is entirely hidden below Antarctica’s frozen surface. The origins of this massive hidden mountain range quickly became one of the greatest unsolved mysteries of Earth’s ancient tectonic past.

“For scientists, it’s deeply puzzling,” researchers Nathan Daczko and Jacqueline Halpin recently wrote at The Conversation. “How could such a massive mountain range form and still be preserved in the heart of an ancient, stable continent?”

The Gamburtsev Mountains: A Geological Mystery

Mountain ranges normally form within the areas where tectonic plates collide. This fundamental reality points to one of the most intriguing mysteries about the Gamburtsev Mountains: the fact that East Antarctica has been tectonically stable now for hundreds of millions of years.

The apparent contradiction between known tectonic activity underlying mountain formation and the stability Antarctica has seen for eons led to many questions about how such a large mountain range could not only form, but also survive in an area with no signs of active tectonic collisions.

Now, in a study by Daczko and Halpin, the authors suggest that the origins of the Gamburtsev Mountains can be traced back more than 500 million years, to when ancient continental masses collided to form Gondwana.

“Our findings offer fresh insight into how mountains and continents evolve over geological time,” the authors recently wrote. “They also help explain why Antarctica’s interior has remained remarkably stable for hundreds of millions of years.”

According to Halpin and Daczko, millions of years ago, partially molten rock flows beneath the continent’s surface led to a thickening and uplifting of the crust. Eventually, the thickened crust collapsed beneath its own weight, resulting from a process known as gravitational spreading. However, a dense root of crust still remained anchored within the Earth’s mantle, which preserved the range.

Reconstructing the Geologic Past

In their study, the scientists analyzed zircon grains embedded in sandstone deposits found in the Prince Charles Mountains, which are a great distance from the Gamburtsev Mountain range. Like veritable time capsules, these zircon deposits helped Halpin and Daczko determine that the Gamburtsev Mountains reached their peak height by around 580 million years ago, with deep crustal melting that ended slightly more recently by around 500 million years ago.

While most mountains are eroded over time by weather or reshaped by successive tectonic events, the Gamburtsev Mountains, by contrast, have remained largely untouched thanks to the protective shielding of the large quantities of ice above them.

Entombed within ice for most of their existence, the Gamburtsev Mountain range’s unique preservation makes it one of the best-preserved ancient mountain systems.

Going Beneath Antarctic Ice

Although their incredible preservation for eons makes them an ideal target for geologists’ study, sampling these deeply frozen mountains would be difficult since drilling through kilometers of ice would be extremely costly.

However, Halpin and Daczko note that recent fieldwork undertaken near the Denman Glacier revealed surface rocks that are believed to potentially be linked to the Gamburtsev range, which could allow scientists a rare opportunity to study the geology of what is arguably one of Earth’s most mysterious buried mountain ranges.

Such findings continue to reveal surprises about the hidden history of Earth’s southernmost continent, much of which remains inaccessible due to the large quantities of ice that cover it. In the future, as new ice-penetrating technologies and more advanced geological modeling become available, scientists hope to begin unraveling more of the secrets that remain frozen beneath Antarctica’s icy exterior.

“Antarctica remains a continent full of geological surprises,” the study’s authors recently wrote, “and the secrets buried beneath its ice are only beginning to be revealed.”

The team’s new study, “Gondwanan continental collision drives gravitational spreading and collapse of the ancestral East Antarctic mountains,” appeared in Earth and Planetary Science Letters.

A new study by scientists at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and several institutes across India and Saudi Arabia has reported 26 novel bacterial species growing inside cleanrooms associated with NASA space missions. These unknown and newly described species carry genetic traits associated with resilience to extreme environments such as those found in space, highlighting the importance of rigorous contamination control to prevent unintentional microbial transfer during space missions.

The work is published in the journal Microbiome.

Spacecraft are assembled in cleanrooms, which are highly specialized facilities engineered to maintain exceptionally low levels of dust and microorganisms. These controlled environments are extreme in their own right, with tightly regulated airflow, temperature, and humidity that inhibit microbial survival. However, some microorganisms—extremophiles—thrive in such environments.

""Our study aimed to understand the risk of extremophiles being transferred in space missions and to identify which microorganisms might survive the harsh conditions of space. This effort is pivotal for monitoring the risk of microbial contamination and safeguarding against unintentional colonization of exploring planets,"" explained King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) Professor Alexandre Rosado, the lead KAUST researcher on the project and a contributor to several NASA working groups on planetary protection and space microbiology.

The scientists did a comprehensive analysis of the microorganisms growing in the NASA cleanrooms, finding that many of the new species possessed genes that made them resilient to decontamination and radiation. Some of the discovered genes were associated with DNA repair, the detoxification of harmful molecules, and improved metabolism, all of which increased the species' survivability.

Moreover, these genes could lead to new biotechnologies that benefit food preservation and medicine.

Contrary to popular belief, neither Venus nor Mars holds this distinction. This revelation challenges decades of conventional astronomical wisdom and offers fascinating implications for future space exploration.

Mercury: our closest neighbor on average

Scientists from NASA and the U.S. Army‘s Engineering Research and Development Center have upended traditional understanding of planetary proximities. Using the innovative “point-circle method,” researchers have calculated average distances between planets over time rather than simply measuring closest approach points. Their findings revealed something unexpected: Mercury is, on average, closer to Earth than either Venus or Mars.

This discovery stems from Mercury’s rapid orbit around the Sun. Despite appearing distant at times, Mercury’s swift revolution means it spends more time on the same side of the solar system as Earth than other planets do. This proximity pattern remained hidden until researchers applied more sophisticated measurement techniques that account for orbital dynamics over extended periods.

The implications extend far beyond Mercury’s relationship with Earth. The research indicates that Mercury is actually the closest neighbor, on average, to every planet in our solar system—even distant Neptune. This perspective fundamentally reshapes how we conceptualize spatial relationships in our cosmic neighborhood and could influence future interplanetary exploration missions.

Journey time to Mercury: faster than you think

While 77 million kilometers—Mercury’s closest approach to Earth—seems vast by terrestrial standards, cosmic distances offer different perspectives. If we consider theoretical spacecraft capabilities similar to NASA’s Parker Solar Probe, reaching Mercury could take approximately five hours at maximum velocity. This revolutionary probe, designed to study our Sun, has achieved unprecedented speeds that transform our understanding of interplanetary travel potential.

The notion that humans could theoretically reach another planet within a half-day timeframe represents a paradigm shift in how we conceptualize space travel. While current technology doesn’t yet support passenger flights at such velocities, the mathematical possibility exists—much like how quantum computing breakthroughs have transformed what we once considered impossible in computational science.

Mercury’s extreme environmental conditions—temperatures ranging from -173°C to 427°C and lack of substantial atmosphere—currently make it inhospitable to human exploration. However, robotic missions like BepiColombo are gathering crucial data about this enigmatic world, following in the footsteps of earlier missions like MESSENGER, which revealed surprising evidence of water ice in permanently shadowed polar craters.

Challenging traditional astronomical wisdom

The misunderstanding about planetary proximities reveals how scientific assumptions can persist unchallenged for generations. Researchers attribute this misconception to “carelessness, ambiguity or group-think” among science communicators who perpetuated an incorrect hypothesis about average planetary distances.

This case demonstrates the importance of revisiting fundamental scientific concepts with new methodologies. Just as seemingly trivial observations have revealed profound cosmic mysteries, recalculating these basic spatial relationships has transformed our understanding of the solar system’s architecture.

The implications extend to various scientific disciplines. Astrobiologists must reconsider proximity factors when studying planetary development. Aerospace engineers might evaluate mission profiles differently knowing Mercury’s average proximity. Even educational materials worldwide require updates to correct this long-standing misconception.

These findings remind us that space observation requires multiple perspectives. While advanced telescopes reveal distant cosmic phenomena, sometimes the most surprising discoveries involve reassessing what we thought we already knew about our immediate cosmic neighborhood.

Reimagining our place in the solar system

This astronomical revelation invites us to reconsider our perception of cosmic proximities. The discovery that Mercury maintains the closest average distance to Earth challenges our Earth-centric view of the solar system and reminds us that orbital mechanics create complex spatial relationships that defy simple categorization.

As space agencies and private companies develop increasingly ambitious exploration plans, understanding these precise spatial relationships becomes crucial for efficient mission planning. Mercury’s newfound status as our closest planetary neighbor on average might influence future scientific priorities and resource allocation for solar system exploration.

This recalibration of our cosmic understanding demonstrates how science constantly evolves, sometimes overturning deeply held beliefs through methodological innovation. By measuring the average positions of planets throughout their orbits rather than focusing solely on closest approach points, researchers have provided a more accurate model of our dynamic solar system—one where Mercury occupies a more central role than previously recognized.","Mercury, often overlooked in discussions about our cosmic neighborhood, has emerged as Earth’s closest planetary companion according to revolutionary calculations.

On March 28, 2025, the city of Mandalay, Myanmar was hit by a magnitude 7.7 earthquake which was felt as far away as Thailand, leaving at least 4,900 people dead.

""Originating along the Sagaing Fault, a 1,400-km-long [870-mile] dextral strike-slip boundary separating the Burma Microplate and Sunda Plate, the earthquake propagated a supershear rupture over 460 km [286 miles], with surface displacements exceeding 6 meters [20 feet],"" a paper on the earthquake explains. ""The shallow (10 km [6-mile] depth) strike-slip mechanism unleashed violent shaking (Modified Mercalli Intensity IX) across densely populated urban centers, including Mandalay, Sagaing, and Naypyidaw, while amplifying seismic energy in distant regions such as Bangkok, Thailand.""

A video, reportedly filmed near Thazi, Myanmar, appears to show the moment two blocks of earth move past each other. Focus on the background in the short video, and you will see the landscape slide around.

The video appears to show a strike slip fault, which can occur as two blocks of rock slip past each other.

""A fault is a fracture or zone of fractures between two blocks of rock. Faults allow the blocks to move relative to each other. This movement may occur rapidly, in the form of an earthquake - or may occur slowly, in the form of creep,"" the US Geological Survey explains, adding that the San Andreas Fault is an example of a right lateral slip fault.

""Faults may range in length from a few millimeters to thousands of kilometers. Most faults produce repeated displacements over geologic time. During an earthquake, the rock on one side of the fault suddenly slips with respect to the other. The fault surface can be horizontal or vertical or some arbitrary angle in between.""

Though the ""everything has a camera in it"" age has given us footage of earthquakes around the world, this appears to be the first example of a fault shift being caught in the act, or at least so dramatically.

""The focal mechanism analysis indicated that the earthquake resulted from strike-slip faulting at a shallow depth of 10 km [6 miles], consistent with rupture activity along the Sagaing Fault,"" the study continues.

""From the epicenter, the rupture propagated over 75 km [47 miles] to the north, terminating just south of Singu, while a more extensive rupture of 420 km [261 miles] occurred to the south, ending near Pyu. The most significant fault slip exceeding 1 meter [3 feet] was concentrated in the section between Singu and Oktwin. In contrast, regions beneath and south of Pyu experienced less than 1 meter of displacement.""

The team adds that the largest slip of 4.3 meters (14 feet) was recorded between Sagaing and Amarapura.

""The entire rupture process spanned just over 80 seconds, with the highest seismic moment release occurring approximately 30 seconds after initiation. The rupture velocity is believed to have exceeded the shear wave velocity, classifying the event as a supershear earthquake.""","A video going around the Internet at the moment in geologist circles appears to show what might be the first ever fault movement caught on camera.

In the modern world, a reliable supply of hydrogen gas is vital for the function of society. Fertilizer produced from hydrogen contributes to the food supply of half the global population, and hydrogen is also a key energy component in many roadmaps to a carbon-neutral future, essential if we are to prevent the worst predictions of climate change.

Today, hydrogen is produced from hydrocarbons, with waste gases contributing to 2.4% of global CO 2 emissions. Demand for hydrogen is set to increase from 90 million metric tons in 2022 to 540 million metric tons in 2050, but it is vital that this hydrogen is not CO 2 emitting.

Production followed by the burial of waste CO 2 (""carbon sequestration"") or from renewable energy resources (wind or solar) are both future sources of hydrogen, but are not yet commercially competitive.

New research from the University of Oxford, in collaboration with Durham University and the University of Toronto, provides a solution. The work is published in the journal Nature Reviews Earth & Environment.

In the last billion years, enough hydrogen gas has been produced by Earth's continental crust to supply mankind's energy needs for at least 170,000 years. While a proportion of this has been lost, consumed, or is inaccessible today, the remaining hydrogen could offer a natural (and emission-free) source of this natural resource.

Until now, limited historical hydrogen sampling and measurement have restricted scientists' current understanding of where, and how much, hydrogen is located in the crust. An exploration recipe is critical to find accessible and commercially viable accumulations of natural geological hydrogen.

Study co-author, Professor Jon Gluyas (Durham University) notes, ""We have successfully developed an exploration strategy for helium and a similar 'first principles' approach can be taken for hydrogen.""

This research outlines the key ingredients needed to inform an exploration strategy to find different ""hydrogen systems."" This includes how much hydrogen is produced and the rock types and conditions these occur in, how the hydrogen migrates underground from these rocks, the conditions that allow a gas field to form, and the conditions that destroy the hydrogen.

Study co-author Professor Barbara Sherwood Lollar (University of Toronto) said, ""We know, for example, that underground microbes readily feast on hydrogen. Avoiding environments that bring them into contact with the hydrogen is important in preserving hydrogen in economic accumulations.""

The authors outline where understanding of these ingredients is strong, and highlight areas that need more work—such as rock reaction efficiencies and how geological histories can bring the right rocks together with the water that reacts with it.

Some sources of hydrogen gas, such as from Earth's mantle, have fueled much speculation and hyperbole—but this research shows that these are not viable sources. Instead, the authors showed that the ingredients for a complete hydrogen system can be found in a range of common geological settings within the crust.

Some of these can be geologically quite young, forming hydrogen ""recently"" (millions to tens of millions of years), others are truly ancient (hundreds of millions of years old)—but critically found globally.

Lead author Professor Chris Ballentine (University of Oxford, Department of Earth Sciences) said, ""Combining the ingredients to find accumulated hydrogen in any of these settings can be likened to cooking a soufflé—get any one of the ingredients, amounts, timing, or temperature wrong and you will be disappointed.

""One successful exploration recipe that is repeatable will unlock a commercially competitive, low-carbon hydrogen source that would significantly contribute to the energy transition—we have the right experience to combine these ingredients and find that recipe.""

The potential for natural geological hydrogen has motivated the authors to form Snowfox Discovery Ltd., an exploration company with a mission to find societally significant natural hydrogen accumulations.","In the modern world, a reliable supply of hydrogen gas is vital for the function of society.

Beneath the surface, root tips probe the soil and spread into branches that keep the plant alive.

Getting those branches to appear at just the right spot and moment matters even more now that weather swings between long dry spells and sudden cloudbursts.

Researchers have traced that timing to autophagy, the recycling pathway many people associate with health benefits from fasting.

By following a shape‑shifting protein through Arabidopsis roots, the team uncovered how brief clean‑up pulses let new branches form and help crops cope with tougher conditions.

Plant roots’ cellular clean‑up crew

Scientists at the University of Copenhagen mapped the pathway in living seedlings. They watched the transcription factor ARF7 vanish and return in predictable waves, each tied to a jump in the growth hormone auxin.

“Fasting has become popular as it seems to have a range of health‑promoting effects in humans, as periods without food cause the body to activate clean‑up processes to dispose of various waste products in cells,” explains Assistant Professor Eleazar Rodriguez from the Department of Biology, who led the study.

“We have proven that the same mechanism, which also exists in the plant kingdom, plays a vital role in the ability of plant roots to grow and absorb water and nutrients for the rest of the plant.”

The process relies on NBR1, a tag that guides used proteins toward a vacuole for breakdown. Each removal of ARF7 resets the signaling circuit so it can fire again a few hours later.

When autophagy slows, ARF7 accumulates, messages run long, and the root loses its usual rhythm.

Autophagy and auxin

Side branches normally form with steady precision. Roughly every four to six hours, auxin peaks at the root tip and switches on genes that mark a patch of tissue for future branching.

“The movement of a root is almost like watching a snake slithering forward in search of water and nourishment in the soil. And we can see that the heartbeat is strongest every time the root meanders forth,” says Rodriguez.

Using a luminescent reporter, the team confirmed that ARF7 cycles in step with those hormone pulses.

To investigate the significance of autophagy, the researchers developed a mutant Arabidopsis (thale cress) plant in which its autophagy was disabled which is shown on the right. With an enzyme from fire flies the researchers made it possible to distinguish the normal plant from the plant with its autophagy function disabled. The plant to the right has fewer light areas and thereby fewer potential places to grow new roots with it’s autophagy function turned off. Click image to enlarge.

The pattern resembles the circadian rhythms that guide leaf opening, yet it runs on its own schedule and focuses solely on building the hidden half of the plant.

When autophagy stalls

The group then disabled key autophagy genes to test the pathway’s limits. Mutant seedlings produced fewer lateral roots and soaked up less water.

“When we disrupted the plant’s autophagy, there was waste everywhere, and we were able to detect the ARF7 protein among the waste,” says Rodriguez.

Microscopy revealed swollen vacuoles packed with debris. Growth zones that once cleared their protein stockpile before each auxin wave now stayed loaded, leaving no room for a fresh signal. The result was a sparse, inefficient root system.

Why does any of this matter?

Because the recycling toolkit is shared across flowering plants, the findings open new options for breeders and for companies developing microbial soil additives.

Numerous methods to change the genetic characteristics of plants are available today. These can be used to get plants to develop longer roots, faster, and in doing so, become more resistant to droughts or floods.

“One of the methods enlists the help of bacteria that live in symbiosis with the plant and can cause the plant to change its growth pattern. Several companies in Denmark are working on this right now,” explains Ph.D. student Jeppe Ansbøl, who co‑authored the study.

Tuning autophagy or adjusting NBR1 tags could let roots chase moisture deeper in the soil and capture stray fertilizer before it washes away, improving harvests without extra inputs.

Autophagy makes stronger roots

“The more roots the plants have, the more water and nutrients they can take up, so the plants grow better, faster,” Rodriquez summarized.

“We’re heavily dependent on plants because they feed us, extract CO2 from the atmosphere and produce the oxygen we breathe. As such, it is extremely important to understand them fully, to which end we have just taken a big step forward.”

Pilot plots in Denmark are already testing these ideas under shifting rain patterns. Early observations hint that crops with tweaked recycling bounce back more quickly after both saturation and dry spells.

What next for crops and autophagy?

Upcoming work will examine whether other auxin response factors move through the same recycling pathway and how changes in light, temperature, or soil chemistry adjust the schedule.

Studies in mosses and liverworts, which split from flowering plants roughly 400 million years ago, may reveal how old the link between autophagy and development really is.

For farmers, a timely cellular tidy‑up could translate into sturdier yields. By keeping root cells clear of clutter, plants gain the freedom to build the networks they need to thrive in a climate that rarely sits still.

The full study was published in the journal EMBO Reports.

An extraordinary experiment on mice and leaves from two different plant species has uncovered direct physical evidence of an eerie 'biophoton' phenomenon ceasing on death, suggesting all living things – including humans – could literally glow with health, until we don't.

The findings might seem a little fringe at first glance. It's hard not to associate scientific investigations into biological electromagnetic emissions with debunked and paranormal claims of auras and discharges surrounding living organisms.

What's more, even in theory, visible wavelengths of light emitted by biological processes ought to be so faint that it's easily swamped by the intense shine of ambient electromagnetic waves in the environment and radiant heat generated by our metabolism, making it a challenge to accurately track across an entire body.

Still, University of Calgary physicist Vahid Salari and his team have claimed to observe just that – an ultraweak photon emission (UPE) produced by several living animals in strong contrast with their non-living bodies, as well as in a handful of plant leaves.

The science behind biophotons is from a controversial idea itself. A variety of biological processes clearly generate bright displays of light in the form of chemiluminescence. And for decades the spontaneous sputtering of light waves anywhere from 200 to 1,000 nanometers in length has been recorded from less obvious reactions among a wide diversity of living cells, from cow heart tissue to bacterial colonies.

A strong contender for the source of this radiation is the effect of various reactive oxygen species that living cells produce when troubled by stresses such as heat, poisons, pathogens, or lack of nutrients.

Given enough molecules of hydrogen peroxide, for example, materials like fats and proteins can undergo transformations that kick their electrons into high gear and spit out a suitably energetic photon or two as they settle back into place.

Having a means of remotely monitoring the stress of individual tissues in whole human or animal patients, or even among crops or bacterial samples, could provide technicians and medical specialists with a powerful, non-invasive research or diagnostics tool.

To determine whether the process could be scaled from isolated tissues to entire living subjects, the researchers used electron-multiplying charge-coupled device and charge-coupled device cameras to compare the faintest of emissions from whole mice – first alive, then dead.

Four immobilized mice were individually placed in a dark box and imaged for an hour, before being euthanized and imaged for another hour. They were warmed to body temperature even after death, to keep heat from being a variable.

The researchers found they could capture individual photons in the visible band of light popping out of the mouse cells before and after death. The difference in the numbers of these photons was clear, with a significant drop in UPE in the measurement period after they were euthanized.

A process carried out on thale cress (Arabidopsis thaliana) and dwarf umbrella tree (Heptapleurum arboricola) leaves revealed similarly bold results. Stressing the plants with physical injuries and chemical agents provided strong evidence that reactive oxygen species could in fact be behind the soft glow.

""Our results show that the injury parts in all leaves were significantly brighter than the uninjured parts of the leaves during all 16 hours of imaging,"" the researchers report.

The experiment encourages speculation that the faintest of ethereal glows produced by stressed cells may perhaps one day tell us whether we're in radiant health.

What's happening?

A team led by Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers determined that, with Earth's warming, space debris could accumulate enough to reduce the low Earth orbit area available for satellites by between a third and 82% by the year 2100, as the Associated Press detailed.

The reason for this, per the study published in Nature Sustainability in March, is that climatic changes high above ground could reduce the effectiveness of the upper atmosphere in clearing up space litter.

""Part of the greenhouse effect that warms the air near Earth's surface also cools the upper parts of the atmosphere where space starts and satellites zip around in low orbit,"" AP science writer Seth Borenstein explained. ""The cooling also makes the upper atmosphere less dense, which reduces the drag on the millions of pieces of human-made debris and satellites.""

Because of that drag, space trash normally gets pulled back toward Earth and burns up along the way. This cleanup effect weakens when the upper atmosphere is cooler and less dense.

Why is an increase in space debris concerning?

Orbiting debris endangers equipment that people on Earth depend on for numerous reasons.

""Rapid expansion in the utilization of satellites in low Earth orbit for communications, weather forecasting, navigation, defence and more has increased humanity's reliance on the long-term sustainability of this region,"" the study noted.

The AP reported that there are millions of pieces of space junk of about one-ninth of an inch or larger that can carry the impact of a bullet.

""A piece of space debris the size of a blueberry can create the impact of a falling anvil,"" per the Space Debris 101 page of The Aerospace Corporation, a company that tracks orbiting items.

""We rely on the atmosphere to clean up our debris,"" Will Parker, the study's lead author, told the AP. ""There's no other way to remove debris. It's trash. It's garbage. And there are millions of pieces of it.""

The researchers used modeling to calculate the satellite carrying capacity of low Earth orbit under different carbon pollution scenarios (with different abilities to burn up trash). Possibilities ranged widely, but the estimated reduction in capacity by 2100 was 82% under the worst-case scenario for the most useful part of the orbital space.

What's being done about space debris?

Scientists and space companies are exploring ways to clean up potentially costly space waste — or to minimize the creation of more.

Meanwhile, reducing the impacts of atmospheric pollution on space debris comes down to reducing that pollution. Under the researchers' better-case scenarios, carbon pollution is lower, and the atmosphere keeps burning space trash at a higher rate.

Reducing pollution carries with it the connected benefits of limiting other costs and risks to people and the planet that come with overheating at Earth's surface.

In addition to government and industry actions to reduce pollution, individuals can take actions big and small — from installing solar panels to finding ways to save money and energy at home.

It appears to have roamed what is now northern Mexico about 73 million years ago, leaving behind tantalizing clues about its life and habitat.

Dr. Claudia Inés Serrano-Brañas of the Smithsonian Institution led the team that analyzed the fossilized remains.

They identified it as an ornithomimid, a family of bird-like dinosaurs that often sported sleek bodies and slender limbs.

Understanding Mexidracon longimanus

Mexidracon longimanus stood around 10 feet from head to tail. It is described as having especially elongated forelimbs, giving it an unusual silhouette that sets it apart from other members of its group.

These dinosaurs are typically known for speed and agility. Paleontologists think ornithomimids relied on their long limbs and lightweight frames to navigate their environments without much trouble.

Experts suggest that the extended arm bones on Mexidracon longimanus hint at specialized behaviors. Some researchers believe long arms could have helped with feeding strategies or movement through dense vegetation.

This species marks only the second ornithomimosaur found in the Cerro del Pueblo Formation in Coahuila.

The fact that another close relative, a deinocheirid, also called this formation home points to a larger variety of so-called theropod lineages in the area.

What are ornithomimosaurs?

“Ornithomimosaurs are a clade of ostrich-like theropod dinosaurs characterized by relatively small and delicate skulls with large orbits, long necks, elongated forelimbs with non-raptorial manus and long cursorial hindlimbs,” explained Dr. Serrano-Brañas.

Body size can range from small forms (over 12 pounds) to the large Late Cretaceous Asian species Deinocheirus mirificus (6 tons).”

Scientists first recognized ornithomimosaurs more than a century ago. Their name derives from Greek words meaning “bird-mimic,” referencing their superficial resemblance to modern flightless birds.

The coahuila connection

The Cerro del Pueblo Formation has yielded several notable dinosaur finds, including this new one. It belongs to the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous, when shallow seas and lush vegetation spread across large parts of North America.

Paleontologists traced many local fossils to ancient floodplains and deltas. These environments likely provided abundant food, attracting a variety of dinosaurs, including smaller theropods and massive hadrosaurs.

Why Mexidracon longimanus matters

Mexidracon longimanus highlights the diversity of ornithomimids in southern Laramidia. This area was once a separate landmass during the Late Cretaceous, isolated by an inland sea that covered much of the central region of North America.

For years, most ornithomimid research focused on Canadian and U.S. sites. The discovery of these bones in 2014 helps fill in gaps about how these bird-like dinosaurs spread across what is now Mexico.

Additional bones from Mexidracon longimanus are stored at the Benemérita Escuela Normal de Coahuila museum. Researchers hope they will reveal more clues about the dinosaur’s growth, diet, and possible social behaviors.

Its extreme limb proportions could hint at broader differences within the family. Experts are keen to compare these remains with other fossils to see whether similar arm features existed elsewhere.

Slim build, big intrigue

Ornithomimids probably had toothless beaks. Many were either herbivorous or omnivorous, though some might have eaten small prey in specific conditions.

Even though this dinosaur appeared “ostrich-like,” it had a unique skeletal framework that sets it apart. Paleontologists are thrilled by the promise of analyzing something truly distinct in an already fascinating group.

Clues hidden in the bones

Bone structure plays a key role in determining how dinosaurs moved. In the case of Mexidracon longimanus, the team noted that its metacarpals – the palm bones – were longer than its foot bones, which is rare among similar species.

This unusual proportion may have affected its balance, stride, or how it interacted with the environment.

Combined with a slightly longer femur than tibia, it hints at movement patterns that might have been slower or more deliberate than expected for a lightweight theropod.

Step toward deeper understanding

Ancient creatures like Mexidracon longimanus can reshape ideas about evolutionary experiments in dinosaur body plans.

Each new discovery from Mexico adds to the picture of what Late Cretaceous ecosystems looked like on a sprawling land bridge.

This long-armed figure could inspire a renewed search for more fossils across Coahuila. That region might contain additional specimens waiting to be recognized, shedding light on how different species lived together.

What’s next for Mexidracon longimanus?

Researchers have been excited to confirm that this dinosaur belongs to Ornithomimidae. Detailed studies into its skeleton will likely continue for years, supported by advanced scanning and reconstruction technology.

There is interest in investigating if these extended arms were tied to feeding or courtship displays. Finding answers demands more fieldwork and collaboration among institutions worldwide.

The study is published in Cretaceous Research.

Study Reveals Your Visual Speed Limit,"When a camera whips around from one point to another, most people expect the fast movement to result in a blurry smear. What they don’t realize, however, is that our own eyes engage in a similar kind of rapid movement—called saccades—over 100,000 times a day. Unlike video cameras, our brain avoids the nauseating blur—but when things move in a particular way, they become invisible.

As detailed in a study published May 8 in Nature Communications, researchers have revealed that the speed of an individual’s saccades corresponds to the limit at which a moving object becomes too fast for them to see. That means people with faster eye movements can perceive faster-moving objects, with potential implications for activities requiring fast eye movements such as sports, video games, and even photography. The researchers claim to be the first to provide evidence for the theory that a person’s movement impacts their perception.

“What parts of the physical world we can sense depends fundamentally on how good our sensors are,” Martin Rolfs, lead author of the study and an active vision scientist at Humboldt University of Berlin’s Department of Psychology, said in a statement by the research group Science of Intelligence. “In this paper, however, we show that the limits of seeing are not just defined by these biophysical constraints but also by the actions and movements that impose changes on the sensory system.”

Rolfs and his colleagues demonstrated that when a study participant saw visual stimuli moving with the same speed and pattern as their own saccade shifts, the stimuli became invisible. This suggests the brain filters out motion that mimics our own eye movements, which might be why our saccades don’t cause visual blurs in the way that cameras do. More broadly, this suggests that physical movement—such as eye movement—limits our sensory system’s perception of the world. In other words, our ability to see things in motion is not just dictated by our sensory abilities, such as the strength, or sensitivity, of the photoreceptors in our eyes.

“In simple terms, the properties of a sensory system such as the human visual system are best understood in the context of the kinematics of actions that drive its input (in this case, rapid eye movements),” said Rolfs. Kinematics is the study of object motion without considering the cause of said motion. “Our visual system and motor system are finely tuned to each other, but this has long been ignored,” he continued. “One of the issues is that the people who study motor control are not the same ones who study perception. They attend different conferences, they publish in different journals—but they should be talking!”

Microbial ecosystems—for example, in seawater, the soil or in the human gut—are astonishingly diverse, but researchers often struggle to reproduce this diversity in the lab: Many microorganisms die when attempts are made to cultivate them.

A new study by researchers at the Helmholtz Institute for Functional Marine Biodiversity at the University of Oldenburg (HIFMB), Germany, offers fresh insights into this longstanding puzzle, suggesting that the survival of microbes does not depend solely on the needs of individual microbes but on a hidden web of relationships that can be caused to collapse by even small structural changes.

In work published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, biodiversity experts Dr. Thomas Clegg and Prof. Dr. Thilo Gross take a simplified view of microbial communities as a network based on cross-feeding, the exchange of metabolic by-products between populations. Each species needs nutrients and at the same time releases substances that are needed as food by others.

Clegg and Gross modeled this complex network by taking a novel approach. They used tools from network theory—a mathematical method developed by physicists—to understand the behavior of complex systems.

The result of the analysis: in the model, the loss of individual populations can cause the entire network to collapse, with the microbial community transitioning abruptly to a state of lower diversity. ""These collapses act as tipping points, resembling blackouts in power grids or supply chain breakdowns seen during the COVID-19 pandemic,"" explains lead author Clegg.

Trying to grow a microbial community in the laboratory is an example of such a perturbation according to the researchers. For example, if not all members of a natural microbial community are included in a sample, they will be missing as producers of metabolic products that are vital for other species. ""By focusing on the structure of these interactions, the study offers new insight into why diversity is so hard to maintain in a lab setting,"" explains Gross.

Although researchers have long suspected that the dependencies between microbes play a key role in our ability to grow them, this study is the first to show how this works across whole communities. The findings offer a new perspective on microbial resilience, highlighting how even in resource-rich environments like lab cultures, communities can fail if the networks of relationships are disrupted.

Crucially, the model also reveals that once a community collapses, recovery can be difficult, even when resources are reintroduced. ""It's not just about what individual microbes need, but who they depend on,"" says Clegg. ""The whole community thrives, or collapses, together.""

This finding shows a new path toward designer fibers with tunable strength, elasticity, and surface chemistry.

The experiments were carried out by the Biomaterials research group at the University of Bayreuth. Using the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing system, the team inserted a fluorescent marker gene into the spiders’ silk-protein DNA, then confirmed the edit when the offspring produced crimson red threads.

Why spider silk excites engineers

Dragline silk already outperforms many man-made fibers. It resists tearing, stretches without snapping, weighs very little and breaks down harmlessly in nature.

If its molecular recipe can be tweaked at will, future filaments could combine even greater toughness with added functions ranging from antimicrobial activity to electrical conductivity. Over the past decade CRISPR-Cas9 has become biology’s precision scalpel.

The enzyme-guide complex targets chosen DNA sites, cuts them, and lets the cell’s own repair crew delete unwanted sequences or patch in new ones. The method has been applied to plants, insects, mice and more, yet spiders had remained untouched.

“Considering the wide range of possible applications, it is surprising that there have been no studies to date using CRISPR-Cas9 in spiders,” said senior author Thomas Scheibel, a professor of biochemistry at Bayreuth.

From egg injection to glowing fiber

Scheibel and doctoral researcher Edgardo Santiago-Rivera mixed the gene-editing components with a sequence coding for a red fluorescent protein. They injected this cocktail into unfertilized spider eggs and later mated the females.

Because the edit happened before fertilization, every cell in the brood carried the new blueprint. When the juveniles spun safety lines, the filaments glowed scarlet under blue light, confirming a successful gene knock-in.

“We have demonstrated, for the first time worldwide, that CRISPR-Cas9 can be used to incorporate a desired sequence into spider silk proteins, thereby enabling the functionalization of these silk fibers,” Scheibel said.

“The ability to apply CRISPR gene-editing to spider silk is very promising for materials science research. For example, it could be used to further increase the already high tensile strength of spider silk.”

Lessons learned from red spider silk

The fluorescent marker acts as a beacon, showing where and how the modified proteins fold into the fiber. That view should help unravel the still-mysterious link between amino-acid sequence, spinning process, and macroscopic performance.

With the roadmap clearer, scientists can test added modules that stiffen the thread, alter its stickiness or carry therapeutic payloads.

Artificial vs. natural spider silk

Earlier attempts to engineer silk relied on copying genes of spiders into bacteria, yeast, plants or even goats. While those hosts churn out raw protein, the artificial threads seldom match the natural product because spinning in air differs from extrusion through a spider’s duct.

Editing the spider itself preserves the native assembly line, letting researchers fine-tune properties without losing the fiber’s intricate nanostructure.

Balancing innovation and ecology

The gene-edited arachnids remained confined to secure laboratories, and the team stresses that large-scale production will require strict containment.

Spiders play key roles in ecosystems, so any field release of modified lines would demand careful risk assessment. For now. the focus lies on fundamental insight and small-batch, high-value uses such as surgical sutures or micro-mechanical springs.

The next web strands to come

Having proved that complex proteins can be knitted into dragline silk, the Bayreuth group plans to insert sequences that enhance strength, adjust elasticity, or add sensing abilities.

Marker colors beyond red could enable multicolored performance mapping. Researchers also hope to explore the spider’s six other silk types – each specialized for tasks like web capture or egg protection – to see how far CRISPR can stretch nature’s design space.

Turning point for sustainable fibers

By merging a molecular editing toolkit with the planet’s premier fiber spinner, the study opens a fresh chapter in biomaterials science. It hints at a future where customized, biodegradable threads are spun at ambient temperature by miniature eight-legged factories – no smokestacks or petrochemicals required.

For now, a vivid red glow in a strand of spiders silk stands as proof that the possibilities are real, and only beginning to be woven.

The study is published in the journal Angewandte Chemie.

The European Space Agency 's (ESA) Proba-3 mission, consisting of two spacecraft called the Occulter and the Coronagraph, flew in perfect formation at a distance of 150 meters (492 feet) from each other with millimeter precision, the agency announced in a May 8 statement .

The pair autonomously maintained their relative position for several hours thanks to a series of sensors, including the Fine Lateral and Longitudinal Sensor (FLLS) laser instrument, a shadow position sensor, and camera-based systems, in combination with onboard software and small cold gas thrusters.

(Image credit: ESA — P. Carril, 2013)

""We are talking about millimetric accuracy in range, and sub-millimetric in the lateral position,"" Damien Galano, Proba-3 project manager, said in the ESA statement.

The successful test paves the way for the spacecraft to carry out their science objective: using the Occulter to block the sun to create a total solar eclipse and allow the Coronagraph to study the sun in this unique state only occasionally seen from Earth .

Scientists aim to use these artificial eclipses to unravel a number of mysteries, such as why the sun's corona , or outer atmosphere, is so hot, what accelerates the solar wind , and how the sun flings material out into space during coronal mass ejections .

But the breakthrough in demonstrating such exquisite levels of formation flying may well have bigger implications for future science and space applications beyond studying the sun. The precision formation technology could be used for enhancing Earth observation, docking spacecraft, using an occulter and observatory to search for exoplanets , and space-based gravitational wave detection.

The two Proba-3 spacecraft were launched by an Indian PSLV rocket in December into a highly elliptical orbit, which takes them as close as 373 miles (600 kilometers) to Earth and as distant as 37,612 miles (60,530 km). The pair form up as they move toward their farthest point from Earth, when the effects of Earth's gravitational pull is smaller, meaning formation flying can be maintained with very little propellant.

Next, the challenge will be getting the spacecraft's payloads ready and then aligning the pair with the sun to create total solar eclipses .

The team's paper introduces a new method to address a long-standing problem in fusion physics: high-energy particles, especially alpha particles produced by fusion reactions, don't always stay confined within the magnetic fields designed to hold them. In stellarators, the type of fusion reactor examined in the study, poor confinement of these fast particles can lead to significant energy loss, making sustained fusion much harder to achieve.

Stellarators use external magnetic coils to generate complex magnetic fields that confine plasma inside the reactor. But those fields can struggle to contain fast-moving particles, especially fusion-born alpha particles, whose trajectories don't always conform to the assumptions built into standard field models.

Accurately predicting how these particles move often requires full-orbit simulations based on the Lorentz force - essentially tracking each particle's exact path. That level of modeling is extremely precise, but also computationally expensive.

UT Austin noted that it could take thousands of designs with slight adjustments to eliminate all the holes in a stellarator magnetic field, making precision design of fusion reactor magnetic fields all but impossible.

Instead of simulating every particle's full orbit, scientists traditionally rely on perturbation theory, a method that approximates particle motion by building on simpler, ideal cases. While effective in many situations, it breaks down for fast-moving particles in complex magnetic fields, leading to inaccurate confinement predictions and underperforming reactor designs.

""Direct application of Newton's laws is too expensive. Perturbation methods commit gross errors,"" said lead paper author Josh Burby, who is an Assistant Professor in the UT Austin physics department. ""Ours is the first theory that circumvents these pitfalls.""

While deeply technical, the work boils down to improving on standard approximations with a machine-learned model that better tracks fast-moving particles in the complex magnetic fields of stellarators, by leveraging a hidden symmetry that traditional methods struggle to capture outside ideal conditions.

According to a UT Austin spokesperson, the new method is ten times faster than Newtonian analysis without losing any of the accuracy, but still has shortcomings. The paper stated that the new data-driven method ""falls short"" in certain applications because it has to be repeated whenever the magnetic field changes, ""encurring [sic] unacceptable computational overhead.""

As with all things lately, we may have to rely on AI to be the saving grace that could make the method practical.

""Recent advances in machine learning, especially in foundation models and sparse regression, stand poised to tackle this challenge,"" the researchers said in the conclusion of their paper.

Additionally, the ""non-perturbative guiding center theory,"" as it's called in the paper, is developed with stellarators in mind, but the approach could, in principle, be extended to tokamaks - the more widely used fusion reactor design.

Unfortunately, the larger problem with fusion energy remains that, in practice, it still takes more energy to run the whole system than the reaction gives back. One approach, firing high-powered lasers at a tiny fuel pellet, has shown real promise.

In the one case where researchers saw so-called ""ignition,"" meaning the energy released by the fusion reaction exceeded the energy delivered to the fuel itself. But even then, far more energy was needed to power the lasers and supporting systems than the fusion produced, resulting in a net energy loss when looking at the full input-output balance.

We definitely need more energy to power our increasingly electric-hungry society, including the massive datacenters that train AI systems. But as with every advance of this type, it's just one drop in a gargantuan bucket of other things that have yet to be resolved. ®","The team's paper introduces a new method to address a long-standing problem in fusion physics: high-energy particles, especially alpha particles produced by fusion reactions, don't always stay confined within the magnetic fields designed to hold them.

Scientists have been baffled after discovering bizarre structures on the Martian surface which look like 'a patchwork of honeycombs, or maybe a patch of waffles'.

These 'wild' hexagonal shapes were uncovered by the Mars Curiosity Rover inside the Gale Crater, where the roaming robot landed in 2012.

Scientists say these tasty-sounding structures might hold the secrets of how life could have started on the Red Planet.

Writing in a NASA blog post, Dr Catherine O'Connell-Cooper, a planetary geologist at the University of New Brunswick, wrote: 'Coming into planning this morning, we found a workspace with amazingly well preserved polygonal shaped fractures.

'We have spotted these before but usually not as well preserved and extensive as this.'

Previous studies suggest that these types of formations may have been created by wet and dry seasons 3.6 to 3.8 million years ago.

As the planet dried out, repeated wet-dry cycles created cracks just like the ones you might see around a drying lake bed on Earth, which have been preserved ever since.

NASA's Curiosity Rover has discovered a set of baffling 'honey and waffle' structures on the Martian surface, and scientists still aren't sure how they were formed

After discovering the honeycomb fractures last week, NASA scientists instructed Curiosity to analyse their composition.

Using a technique called 'Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy', Curiosity will fire a laser pulse at the surface of the sample to create a small burst of plasma.

By looking at the light emitted by this plasma, scientists are able to work out what kinds of chemicals are in the rocks.

NASA also plans to take some measurements of the nearby bedrock without any honeycomb structures for comparison.

However, it might be some time before the findings from those studies are analysed and made public.

In the meantime, NASA's rover operators are not entirely sure what the polygon structures might be.

Dr O'Connell-Cooper says: 'The origin of these cracks is not clear - could they have formed as desiccation cracks as Mars began to get drier, billions of years ago?

'Or during later periods when groundwater moved through the bedrock?'

The structures may have been formed when an ancient lakebed repeatedly filled and dried out in Mars' wetter past. Curiosity will use its laser to gather data about the structures' composition to learn more

NASA's Curiosity Rover has been travelling around Mars' Gale Crater since it landed in 2012. This vast impact crater was formed around 3.7 billion years ago when a meteor hit the planet. In the distant past, it may have been filled with water and formed a large lake

This is not the first time that NASA has spotted regular, polygon structures on Mars, but scientists are still working to learn more about how they formed.

Previously, scientists thought that they were mud cracks, like those you might see in an empty riverbed during a drought, formed as a once-wet Mars dried out.

However, new analysis has suggested that their origins might be more complex.

In 2021, NASA first took images of a series of polygonal cracks on the slopes of Mount Sharp, a 3-mile (5 km) tall peak in the Gale Crater.

The cracks were found above a rich clay deposit, which was probably once the bed of an ancient lake, and below an area rich in sulphates left behind as the water dried.

This initially supported the idea that the cracks had been formed by a drying lake, but subsequent analysis showed that the newer cracks contained traces of sulphates.

This suggested that the lake had dried out multiple times, pulling sulphate-rich water down into the cracks.

According to the researchers, this means the cracks were made during a time in which the water level in the lake was rising and falling seasonally.

Researchers found that these cracks contained chemicals called sulphates, which suggested the lake had been repeatedly filled and dried. On Earth, these wet-dry cycles could have been the origin of the complex molecules which led to the first lifeforms

Their complex, waffle-like shape emerged and became more complex through these repeated wet-dry cycles.

Since these newly discovered polygons have a similar shape, they may have been formed through a similar process.

If so, they could hold clues to how life might have formed on Mars during the planet's wet past.

On Earth, scientists believe that repeated wet-dry cycles could be how the first organic compounds, molecules found in all living things, were formed.

As the water rises and falls, new chemicals are constantly brought into the environment, which encourages the reactions which form complex molecules.

In a statement at the time, NASA scientist Dr Ashwin Vasavada said that these processes could have 'promoted the origin of life'.

However, these smaller structures are not the only mysterious patterns that scientists have spotted on Mars.

In 2023, the Chinese Zhurong rover detected 15 vast honeycomb structures hidden dozens of metres beneath the Martian surface.

Billions of years ago, Mars may have been covered with liquid water, the traces of this history can now only be found in its geology

Scientists have also found vast polygon-shaped cracks beneath the Martian surface, which may have been formed by sudden changes in temperature as the climate shifted

Each crack is 70 metres across and is bordered by 30 metres of ice and mud slurry formed between two and 3.5 billion years ago.

On Earth, similar structures are only found in Greenland, Iceland, and Antarctica, where sudden temperature shifts create fractures that are filled with ice and mud.

Scientists believe a similar process might have split open Mars' surface as it wobbled on its axis, drastically changing the seasonal temperatures.

This could be yet another clue about how the Red Planet's climate has changed over the last few billion years, and whether it was ever habitable.","Scientists have been baffled after discovering bizarre structures on the Martian surface which look like 'a patchwork of honeycombs, or maybe a patch of waffles'.

2025-05-12 23:48:45,2025-05-13 07:48:45 +08,https://www.earth.com/news/thousands-of-seafloor-holes-pockmarks-evenly-spaced-and-distributed-defy-explanation/,Thousands of massive holes found on the seafloor are evenly-spaced with 'eerie regularity',"The central California coast hides a dimpled and pockmarked seafloor region that is roughly the size of Los Angeles – five hundred square miles of soft‑edged pits stretching from Big Sur to Morro Bay.

For decades ocean scientists assumed these round depressions – a whopping six‑football‑field stretch from rim to rim and about 16 feet deep – were scars left by bubbles of methane burping up through the mud.

That tidy explanation raised eyebrows once plans for an offshore wind farm landed on the same patch of continental slope between 1,600 and 5,200 feet below the waves. If methane were still leaking, could turbine anchors stay put?

Curiosity turned urgent when more than 5,200 of the formations, known as pockmarks, appeared to be distributed with “eerie regularity.”

The pattern suggested an active force was sculpting and preserving the craters even today.

To settle the debate, a research team rolled out a fleet of high‑tech robots and a mountain of sensors – and overturned a favorite myth about how the seafloor breathes.

Seafloor full of large pockmarks

Autonomous underwater vehicles zipped barely yards above the bottom, beaming back sonar so sharp it mapped individual ripples of sand.

The survey refined ship‑based maps and revealed that most pockmarks sit almost perfectly spaced apart, each nearly circular and averaging 656 feet across.

Back at mission control aboard the research vessel, experts from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI), the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and Stanford University watched the topography scroll across their monitors at one‑foot resolution.

The robots also carried a CHIRP sub‑bottom profiler, a sound cannon that peeks some 25 feet beneath the mud.

Instead of pockets of gas, profiles showed neat layers: thin bands of fine silt interrupted by coarser sand sheets. Those buried sand sheets hinted at something far more dramatic than gentle gas seepage.

Sending in the robots

Guided by the maps, MBARI’s remotely operated vehicle Doc Ricketts descended for 30 dives, clocking 185 hours of video and punching 107 vibracores and 433 shallow pushcores into the pockmark floors.

An additional cruise brought up piston cores nearly 25 feet long for comparison outside the craters. Not a whiff – chemical or acoustic – of methane turned up in any sample.

“There are many unanswered questions about the seafloor and its processes,” said MBARI Senior Research Technician Eve Lundsten.

“This research provides important data about the seafloor for resource managers and others considering potential offshore sites for underwater infrastructure to guide their decision‑making.”

Seafloor avalanches and pockmarks

Each core carried a timeline of turmoil. Fine mud settled quietly for millennia, then a blanket of gritty sand crashed in, marking a colossal underwater avalanche called a sediment gravity flow.

The team counted turbidite layers back at least 280,000 years, with the most recent flow sweeping through roughly 14,000 years ago.

When such a slurry roars downslope, it scours the center of every pockmark in its path and drops a fresh sand layer across the field in one go – resetting the craters like simultaneous footprints.

“We collected a massive amount of data, allowing us to make a surprising link between pockmarks and sediment gravity flows,” Lundsten explained.

“We were unable to determine exactly how these pockmarks were initially formed, but with MBARI’s advanced underwater technology, we’ve gained new insight into how and why these features have persisted on the seafloor for hundreds of thousands of years.”

Clean energy from seafloor pockmarks

Undersea avalanches strike tens of thousands of years apart, yet their legacy shapes today’s renewable energy blueprint.

Turbine foundations must grip rock‑steady ground for decades; a bubbling gas pocket could undermine that. The new findings relieve a major worry.

Instead of methane, the main architect here is long‑dormant sediment flow, meaning the crust has remained effectively quiet since well before humans started farming California’s Central Valley.

“Expanding renewable energy is critical to achieving the dramatic cuts in carbon dioxide emissions needed to prevent further irreversible climate change,” noted MBARI President and CEO Chris Scholin.

“However, there are still many unanswered questions about the possible environmental impacts of offshore wind energy development,”

Many questions still need answers

Although the study pinned down how the craters stay fresh, their birth story remains elusive.

Did an ancient mega‑flow carve the first depressions, or did subtle currents gradually nudge sediment aside until a small hollow invited bigger scours?

Computer models will test whether an unconfined flow racing over the dimpled plain can muster enough force to keep those bowls tidy without help from escaping gas.

Future research will also track how water and sediment swirl through the neighboring Lucia Chica and San Simeon Channels – twin conduits that may funnel slurries into the field.

For now, the Sur Pockmark Field stands as the best‑charted seafloor province on North America’s west coast, a natural laboratory where wind‑farm planners, geologists, and marine ecologists share common ground.

What they’ll find next is anyone’s guess.

2025-05-12 13:52:49-07:00,2025-05-13 04:52:49 +08,https://scitechdaily.com/researchers-solve-impossible-math-problem-after-200-years/,Researchers Solve “Impossible” Math Problem After 200 Years,"A mathematician has developed an algebraic solution to an equation that was long thought to be unsolvable.

A groundbreaking discovery from a UNSW Sydney mathematician may finally offer a solution to one of algebra’s toughest problems: how to solve high-degree polynomial equations.

Polynomials are equations where a variable (like x) is raised to various powers. A simple example is: 1 + 4x – 3x² = 0.

These equations aren’t just for math textbooks, they’re essential in everything from predicting planetary motion to coding software.

But when it comes to “higher-order” polynomials, where x is raised to the fifth power or beyond, mathematicians have struggled for centuries to find a universal solving method. That could be about to change, thanks to this exciting new breakthrough.

Now, UNSW Honorary Professor Norman Wildberger has revealed a new approach using novel number sequences, outlined in a recent publication with computer scientist Dr. Dean Rubine.

“Our solution reopens a previously closed book in mathematics history,” Prof. Wildberger says.

The polynomial problem

Solutions to degree-two polynomials have been around since 1800 BC, thanks to the Babylonians’ ‘method of completing the square’, which evolved into the quadratic formula familiar to many high school math students. This approach, using roots of numbers called ‘radicals’, was later extended to solve three- and four-degree polynomials in the 16th century.

Then, in 1832, French mathematician Évariste Galois showed how the mathematical symmetry behind the methods used to resolve lower-order polynomials became impossible for degree five and higher polynomials. Therefore, he figured, no general formula could solve them.

Approximate solutions for higher-degree polynomials have since been developed and are widely used in applications but, Prof. Wildberger says, these don’t belong to pure algebra.

Radical rejection behind new method

The issue, he says, lies in the classical formula’s use of third or fourth roots, which are radicals.

The radicals generally represent irrational numbers, which are decimals that extend to infinity without repeating and can’t be written as simple fractions. For instance, the answer to the cubed root of seven, 3√7 = 1.9129118… extends forever.

Prof. Wildberger says this means that the real answer can never be completely calculated because “you would need an infinite amount of work and a hard drive larger than the universe.”

So, when we assume 3√7 ‘exists’ in a formula, we’re assuming that this infinite, never-ending decimal is somehow a complete object.

This is why, Prof. Wildberger says, he “doesn’t believe in irrational numbers.”

Irrational numbers, he says, rely on an imprecise concept of infinity and lead to logical problems in mathematics.

Prof. Wildberger’s rejection of radicals inspired his best-known contributions to mathematics, rational trigonometry, and universal hyperbolic geometry. Both approaches rely on mathematical functions like squaring, adding, or multiplying, rather than irrational numbers, radicals, or functions like sine and cosine.

His new method to solve polynomials also avoids radicals and irrational numbers, relying instead on special extensions of polynomials called ‘power series’, which can have an infinite number of terms with the powers of x.

By truncating the power series, Prof. Wildberger says, they were able to extract approximate numerical answers to check that the method worked.

“One of the equations we tested was a famous cubic equation used by Wallis in the 17th century to demonstrate Newton’s method. Our solution worked beautifully,” he said.

New geometry for a general solution

However, Prof. Wildberger says the proof for the method is, ultimately, based on mathematical logic.

His method uses novel sequences of numbers that represent complex geometric relationships. These sequences belong to combinatorics, a branch of mathematics that deals with number patterns in sets of elements.

The most famous combinatorics sequence, called the Catalan numbers, describes the number of ways you can dissect a polygon, which is any shape with three or more sides, into triangles.

The numbers have important practical applications, including in computer algorithms, data structure designs, and game theory. They even appear in biology, where they’re used to help count the possible folding patterns of RNA molecules. And they can be calculated using a simple two-degree polynomial.

“The Catalan numbers are understood to be intimately connected with the quadratic equation. Our innovation lies in the idea that if we want to solve higher equations, we should look for higher analogues of the Catalan numbers.”

Prof. Wildberger’s work extends these Catalan numbers from a one-dimensional to multi-dimensional array based on the number of ways a polygon can be divided using non-intersecting lines.

“We’ve found these extensions, and shown how, logically, they lead to a general solution to polynomial equations.

“This is a dramatic revision of a basic chapter in algebra.”

Even quintics – a degree five polynomial – now have solutions, he says.

Aside from theoretical interest, he says, the method holds practical promise for creating computer programs that can solve equations using the algebraic series rather than radicals.

“This is a core computation for much of applied mathematics, so this is an opportunity for improving algorithms across a wide range of areas.”

Geode’s unexplored facets

Prof Wildberger says the novel array of numbers, which he and Dr. Rubine called the “Geode”, also holds vast potential for further research.

“We introduce this fundamentally new array of numbers, the Geode, which extends the classical Catalan numbers and seem to underlie them.

“We expect that the study of this new Geode array will raise many new questions and keep combinatorialists busy for years.

“Really, there are so many other possibilities. This is only the start.”

A reconstruction of a cool-temperate rainforest and river landscape during the early Cretaceous period in what is now southern Australian.

Australia is rather isolated today, but around 120 million years ago, the island straddled the polar circle and formed a giant landmass with Antarctica. At that time, dinosaurs lived on this landmass — and thanks to a new study, we now know what their habitat looked like.

New illustrations show that ""polar dinosaurs"" roamed cool-temperate forests crisscrossed by rivers and carpeted with large ferns. These dinosaurs included small ornithopods — herbivorous dinosaurs with beaks and cheeks full of teeth — and small theropods, which were mostly carnivorous dinosaurs that walked on two legs and often had feathers, one of the study's authors wrote in The Conversation .

""What is now Victoria was once within the polar circle, up to 80 degrees south of the equator and shrouded in darkness for months at a time,"" wrote co-author Vera Korasidis , a lecturer in environmental geoscience at the University of Melbourne and a research associate at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History. ""Despite these harsh conditions, dinosaurs thrived here , leaving behind evidence of their existence at various palaeontological sites.""

The amount of sunlight reaching the Antarctic Circle has remained the same over the eons, but the climate was much balmier during the Cretaceous period (145 million to 66 million years ago) than it is today, with temperatures averaging between 11 and 25 degrees Fahrenheit (6 to 14 degrees Celsius) warmer than current temperatures. The Early Cretaceous (140 million to 110 million years ago), in particular, stands out as one of the warmest periods in the past 500 million years of Earth's history, Korasidis wrote, ruling out the existence of polar ice caps.

Paleontologists have been studying rocks containing dinosaur fossils from the southern Australian state of Victoria for decades, but they have also been analyzing microscopic spores and pollen grains that may be from plant life that existed near the South Pole during the Early Cretaceous, Korasidis wrote.

For the new study, Korasidis and her co-author Barbara Wagstaff , a pollen and spore specialist at the University of Melbourne, examined nearly 300 pollen and spore samples from 48 sites along the Victoria coast. These samples, which date to between 130 million and 110 million years ago, shed light on the evolution of forests and floodplains where dinosaurs lived, Korasidis wrote.

Ancient conifers made up most of the forest canopy, while ferns — specifically, scaly tree ferns (Cyatheaceae), forked ferns (Gleicheniaceae) and another group of primitive ferns (Schizaeaceae) — dominated the understory, according to the study. The researchers noticed an abundance of flowering plants appeared starting around 113 million years ago, which agrees with the timing of the proliferation of flowering plants globally.

""The appearance of flowering plants in the landscape resulted in the extinction of numerous understorey plants,"" Korasidis wrote in The Conversation.

A new review reveals how each hemisphere processes the opposite side of your field of vision, not only early on but even in higher-level cognition like attention and memory.

This separation gives us a “bilateral advantage,” increasing our capacity to track multiple objects across the visual field. The brain seamlessly coordinates the handoff of information between hemispheres, avoiding confusion as objects move across our gaze.

People have a lot of misconceptions about what the brain’s left and right hemispheres do, but one well-known aspect of this division may be even more true than people realize:

The brain not only splits up visual spatial perception—processing what’s on our left in the right hemisphere and what’s on our right in the left hemisphere—it takes cognitive advantage of that.

Credit: Neuroscience News

A new review by MIT neuroscientists explains what the field has learned about this division of labor, the trade-off it involves and how the brain ultimately bridges the divide.

“People hear all these myths about the left brain being more analytical and the right brain being more artistic, or people being right-brained vs left-brained. Ninety-nine percent of that is nonsense,” said paper co-author Earl K. Miller, Picower Professor in The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory and the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT.

“You think with your whole brain.”

But when it comes to visual spatial perception, the brain has evolved separate neural resources for the right vs left sides of gaze even in later stages of cognitive processing, Miller said. Why? To optimize its capacity.

“It’s for good reason,” said Miller, who co-authored the new review in the journal Neuropsychologia with Picower Institute research scientist Scott Brincat.

“Perceptual capacity is limited—you can only take in so much at once. If you’re your capacity is fully tied up on the right side of your gaze, you might miss a threat approaching on the left. Splitting resources between both sides helps avoid dangerous perceptual blind spots”.

Separated sight

When Miller was in graduate school, he said, he was taught that the brain neatly divided its visual perception of space between hemispheres until the information reached the prefrontal cortex where it became seamlessly blended.

But experiments by Miller and Brincat, as well as many other researchers, have been accumulating evidence to refine that view over the last 20 years.

These studies have shown that even in the prefrontal cortex, neural encoding of information about where an object is, is still biased toward the “contralateral” hemisphere, or the hemisphere opposite of where the object appears in the field of view.

“As a result, the two hemispheres appear to function surprisingly independently, even for high-level cognitive functions like attention and working memory,” the authors wrote.

The evidence is apparent in measurements of the brain waves produced by coordinated networks of neurons in each hemisphere. Gamma frequency wave power increases in frontal brain hemispheres when they consider the visual stimuli that appear on the contralateral side.

Meanwhile, studies for decades (including one in 1971) have shown that people and animals can remember more things if their presentation is split between hemispheres rather than presented all on one side.

Neuroscientists call this the “bilateral advantage,” though it is not perfect. People don’t track multiple things, even if split across both sides, as well as they track just one thing on either side.

People also exhibit individualized differences in perceptual capacity across the visual field. Miller has founded the startup company SplitSage to measure these differences with the goal of helping people with visually oriented complex tasks to improve their performance.

Notably, the studies that Brincat and Miller review in the new paper show that the split bias between hemispheres applies only to spatial information—the where something is. Other features like color or shape are processed by both hemispheres.

Seamless sight

If the brain maintains a separation in its processing of spatial visual perception, even at the stage of allocating attention and juggling objects in working memory, why aren’t we confused or surprised when a bird flying from our left passes into the right side of our field of view? We also easily handle cases where our shifting gaze moves an object from one eye’s field of view to the other’s.

“We experience a seamless world,” Miller said.

It turns out that the brain accomplishes the “handoff” from one hemisphere to the other much like two cellular towers do for your phone as you drive around, according to neural activity measurements in studies such as one in 2014 and one that Brincat and Miller led in 2021.

“As a tracked target approaches the visual midline, the hemisphere about to receive the target shows a ramp-up of activity well before the crossing time, as if it is anticipating the target,” the authors wrote.

“Further, activity in the sending hemisphere remains high well after the crossing. Thus, for up to a second or more, neural signals reflecting the target are shared across both hemispheres. It is as if both hemispheres are holding the baton.”

As with the “bilateral advantage,” there is a small performance cost when this transfer happens, studies show.

Deficits in interhemispheric connectivity or synchrony are apparent in neurological and psychiatric diseases including Alzheimer’s, anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder and autism spectrum disorders, the authors note. Brincat and Miller’s review emphasizes that such disruptions could affect cognition.

“A foundational understanding of interhemispheric processing, combined with interventions translatable to human patients offers hope for developing novel network-level treatments,” they wrote.

“Cognitive independence and interactions between cerebral hemispheres” by Scott Brincat et al. Neuropsychologia

Abstract

Cognitive independence and interactions between cerebral hemispheres

The two cerebral hemispheres can often operate independently.

But interactions between them are critical for cognition and have been implicated in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders.

Neurophysiological studies have long focused on a single hemisphere.

Here, we review recent studies showing neurophysiological evidence showing both independence and interactions between the hemispheres during complex behavior.","Summary: Despite popular myths about left- and right-brain thinking, research shows the hemispheres truly do divide up certain tasks—especially visual spatial perception.

Controlling quantum states with high precision—and entangling particles—has long been the goal of researchers pushing the boundaries of quantum technology. Although great strides have been made across various systems, applying this control to complex molecular structures presents new and thrilling opportunities.

A recent breakthrough showcases long-lived entanglement between ultracold polar molecules, marking a major step forward. This result could reshape what's possible in quantum computing, precision sensing, and the understanding of fundamental physical laws.

Unlocking Quantum Frontiers with Ultracold Molecules

Ultracold polar molecules offer distinct benefits for quantum experiments. Their internal complexity—shaped by vibrational and rotational states and permanent electric dipole moments—makes them highly responsive to control techniques, setting the stage for advanced quantum applications.

These features allow for long-range interactions and the ability to store quantum information for longer durations. Molecules can also be used to make highly accurate measurements using rotational states. But the same sensitivity that makes them valuable also makes them fragile. Environmental interference can lead to rapid decoherence, which poses a challenge for practical use.

Even with these difficulties, researchers have made remarkable progress. Individual molecules have been held in optical tweezers, and entangled pairs have been created with high accuracy. These successes are critical milestones that bring us closer to scalable molecular quantum technologies.

Entangling molecules allows them to share quantum states and influence one another instantly, no matter how far apart they are. This capability supports the creation of synthetic dimensions for quantum simulation and opens new paths for building powerful, high-dimensional quantum computers.

Breakthroughs in Molecular Entanglement

A team of researchers at Durham University has achieved a major milestone by creating a highly controlled environment for ultracold molecules. Using optical traps known as “magic-wavelength optical tweezers,” they eliminated single-particle decoherence on experimental timescales.

This innovation allowed the entanglement of molecule pairs with unprecedented fidelity, reaching over 92% and even higher when accounting for correctable errors.

Professor Simon Cornish, a lead researcher, explained, “The results highlight the remarkable control we have over individual molecules. Quantum entanglement is very fragile, yet we can entangle two molecules using incredibly weak interactions and then prevent loss of the entanglement for a time approaching one second.”

This level of control not only preserves entanglement but also extends its duration, critical for advanced quantum applications.

The use of magic-wavelength optical tweezers stabilizes the molecules by eliminating environmental noise. This stability allows researchers to entangle molecules using detectable hertz-scale interactions at particle spacings of just 2.8 micrometers.

Furthermore, the team demonstrated entanglement using direct microwave excitation, a technique that could enable robust entangling operations despite experimental imperfections.

Applications and Implications

This breakthrough has far-reaching implications for quantum science. Long-lived molecular entanglement enhances the potential for precision measurements in quantum sensing, a field essential for detecting minute changes in physical systems. These measurements could revolutionize fields like navigation, materials science, and fundamental physics by offering unmatched accuracy.

In quantum computing, molecular systems can encode and process information in rotational states, providing a platform for high-dimensional computation.

Dr. Daniel Ruttley of Durham University emphasized the potential, stating, “Our work demonstrates the incredible potential of molecules as building blocks for next-generation quantum technologies. Long-lived molecular entanglement could be exploited to construct quantum computers or precise quantum sensors and to understand the quantum nature of complex materials.”

Moreover, this research contributes to the development of quantum memories, devices capable of storing quantum information for extended durations. Quantum memories are essential for creating robust quantum networks, which underpin technologies like quantum internet and distributed quantum computing. By stabilizing molecular entanglement, researchers have taken a significant step toward realizing these technologies.

The Future of Molecular Quantum Control

The ability to precisely control and entangle molecules offers new avenues for exploring fundamental science. For instance, ultracold molecules can simulate complex quantum materials, providing insights into phenomena that are difficult to study directly. They also hold potential for quantum-enhanced metrology, enabling measurements that push the boundaries of accuracy and precision.

This research demonstrates how advancements in experimental techniques can overcome the challenges posed by molecular complexity. By creating stable environments and leveraging the unique properties of molecules, scientists are unlocking new possibilities in quantum science. The implications extend beyond quantum computing and sensing, influencing areas like ultracold chemistry and fundamental physics.

According to this research, the Earth will undergo a slow but irreversible atmospheric transformation.

This process, set to take place over the next billion years, will result in the depletion of atmospheric oxygen, making the planet uninhabitable for complex life forms. The study outlines a transition that is already underway on geological timescales and will eventually end the oxygen-rich conditions that support humans, animals, and plants today.

Earth’s Future Atmosphere Will Resemble Its Distant Past

The team of scientists simulated the long-term evolution of Earth’s atmosphere. They concluded that the eventual fate of our planet involves a return to a state that predates the rise of complex life. The researchers pointed to a mechanism involving the Sun’s gradual brightening, which will accelerate the breakdown of carbon dioxide (CO₂) in the atmosphere.

This decrease in CO₂ will cause photosynthetic plants to die off, eliminating the primary source of atmospheric oxygen. The result is a future where oxygen becomes so scarce that aerobic life forms—including humans—will not be able to survive. According to the study, this process could begin in as little as 10,000 years, with atmospheric oxygen dropping to levels up to a million times lower than today.

The transformation will unfold rapidly in geological terms, leaving very little time for oxygen-dependent species to adapt. Once the oxygen is gone, the Earth’s protective ozone layer will vanish as well, exposing the surface to lethal ultraviolet radiation from the Sun.

A Slow Countdown Toward Extinction

The BGR report adds context by explaining that Earth’s current oxygen levels are relatively recent. Before the Great Oxidation Event around 2.4 billion years ago, Earth was dominated by a methane-rich atmosphere and iron-saturated oceans. Life consisted primarily of anaerobic organisms like cyanobacteria.

When oxygen levels surged due to photosynthesis, the environment changed dramatically, giving rise to new ecosystems. But scientists now believe this process will reverse. The atmosphere is expected to lose its oxygen and become rich in methane once again, restoring ancient conditions unsuitable for most current life forms.

Researchers estimate that once photosynthesis collapses due to the lack of CO₂, the cascade effect will be irreversible. The surface of the planet will slowly become a dry and lifeless desert, stripped of breathable air and shelter from radiation. While humans and other animals will be long gone by the time this happens, anaerobic microorganisms—the same types that thrived before the oxygenation of Earth—may survive in isolated environments.

Microbes Will Remain After Complex Life Fades

In the distant future, Earth will likely be populated only by anaerobic bacteria and archaea, which can exist without oxygen and are immune to the high levels of methane expected in the atmosphere. According to the researchers, this form of life could persist even after the extinction of all complex species. The Earth’s environment will, in essence, return to what it was billions of years ago: a planet dominated by microbial ecosystems rather than animals or plants.

Despite the loss of complex life, the planet itself will not cease to exist. Earth will continue to orbit the Sun, albeit as a hostile and barren world. Researchers describe this scenario as a natural part of Earth’s long evolutionary arc, emphasizing that “the slow countdown of life on Earth will begin,” once atmospheric oxygen begins to fall. From that point forward, there will be no possibility of reversal.

Researchers Urge Reflection on Earth’s Temporary Habitability

The study, though focused on the far future, also carries a philosophical undertone. It highlights how fragile and temporary the conditions for life truly are. While humans may not be present when this event unfolds, the knowledge that Earth’s habitability is finite adds weight to current environmental and scientific efforts. The researchers suggest this awareness should prompt deeper reflection on how humanity treats the environment today.

The findings show that Earth’s oxygen-rich atmosphere, while seemingly permanent, is just a phase in the planet’s long geological history. The transition back to an oxygen-free world is not hypothetical—it is expected. This natural shift will not involve explosions, asteroid impacts, or artificial intelligence run amok. Instead, as described by the research team, life will end in silence, “asphyxiated by a lack of oxygen.”","This process, set to take place over the next billion years, will result in the depletion of atmospheric oxygen, making the planet uninhabitable for complex life forms.
Earth’s Future Atmosphere Will Resemble Its Distant PastThe team of scientists simulated the long-term evolution of Earth’s atmosphere.

Beneath the tranquil surface of Grand Traverse Bay lies a secret far older than any shipwreck. Long known for calm waters and a proud seafaring past, the bay is now drawing attention for a prehistoric twist hidden beneath its waves. Over the years, divers have uncovered the skeletons of sunken trade vessels, remnants of a vibrant shipping era. But this time, the spotlight has shifted to something far more ancient.

Dr. Mark Holley, an underwater archaeology professor at Northwestern Michigan University, made the find during a routine sonar scan. What he discovered stunned researchers—a mysterious arrangement of large stones resting on the lake bed. Dubbed ""Michigan’s Stonehenge"" by those who’ve seen it, the site is stirring fresh curiosity about the region's forgotten chapters.

About 40 feet below the surface, a winding line of stones spans over a mile. Though smaller than the famous British monument, the layout shows deliberate design. The stones range from basketball-sized to as big as compact cars, forming a serpentine trail that defies natural explanation.

Among these ancient rocks, one stands out. It measures about 3.5 feet tall and 5 feet across and features a carved mastodon. This detail links the site to a time when humans and prehistoric giants shared the same land. The image—etched in stone—offers a rare bridge between ancient life and early culture in North America.

Experts believe the stones were arranged roughly 9,000 years ago, shortly after the Ice Age ended. At that time, the waters of Grand Traverse Bay had not yet risen to cover the land. This would make the site 4,000 years older than England’s Stonehenge, placing it deep within the early Holocene period.

Mapping the Depths of Grand Traverse Bay

The bay itself stretches 32 miles long and 12 miles wide. Located along the northeastern coast of the lake, it’s a magnet for divers and history lovers. Many visit to explore the shipwrecks scattered across the bottom. But few know of the ancient relic that sleeps deeper still, hidden from curious eyes.

To protect the site, Dr. Holley took swift action. He informed the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa, showing respect for their ancestral ties to the land. Today, the location of the stone trail remains confidential. Its exact coordinates are withheld to preserve its integrity and guard it against potential harm.

The submerged nature of the stones poses a significant challenge for archaeologists. Since their discovery in 2007, progress in studying the site has been slow, leading to widespread speculation about its significance. Researchers have looked to other regional stone formations for potential correlations, hoping to unravel the secrets of these underwater stones.

Similar stone structures in the vicinity provide tantalizing clues about the purpose of the Grand Traverse Bay arrangement. Dr. John O'Shea from the University of Michigan has studied a rock formation in Lake Huron, dating back 9,000 years.

Situated 120 feet below the surface along the Alpena-Amberley Ridge, this stone assemblage is believed to have been used for ancient hunting practices, possibly to channel caribou.

Beaver Island, the largest island in Lake Michigan, also holds ancient stone formations. On the island's west side, along the Reddings Trail, a circle of glacial boulders is found, some marked with inscriptions. One stone even features a carved hole, suggesting it had a functional use.

Although formal analyses like carbon dating are lacking, these stones are thought to have been significant to the Native American communities that once inhabited the island, possibly serving as calendrical markers or celestial observation points.

Unraveling the Mysteries

The purpose of the Grand Traverse Bay stone arrangement remains speculative. It could have been used by ancient caribou hunters, similar to the Lake Huron formation, or it might have served as an ancient calendar, aligning with celestial events like Stonehenge. The ambiguity highlights the need for further research and analysis, which is complicated by the underwater setting.

As technology advances, new methods of underwater exploration and analysis emerge, bringing us closer to understanding these ancient structures. Each discovery adds to our knowledge of the past, allowing us to glimpse the lives and practices of those who lived thousands of years ago.

In the coming years, the secrets of Grand Traverse Bay are likely to unfold further, providing invaluable insights into prehistoric life and the ancient peoples who once called this region home. Through meticulous research and respectful preservation, we honor their memory and enrich our understanding of the world’s ancient past.

Located at the galactic center, this 230-light-year-long filament has been struck by a pulsar moving at incredible speeds. The findings, published in May 2024 in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, provide new insights into how pulsars can interact with their surroundings in extreme ways.

The Cosmic ‘Bone’ – What is the Snake Filament?

The Snake is no ordinary structure. It is a gigantic, smooth filament of magnetic fields that spans a colossal 230 light-years across the center of the Milky Way galaxy. The Snake is essentially a vast thread of energy and matter, glowing due to spiraling particles that accelerate along its magnetic lines. What makes this filament so intriguing is not only its scale but also the fact that it has been relatively smooth—except for two notable fractures, which were previously unexplained.

These fractures have been a mystery to astronomers for some time, but recent observations using Chandra X-ray Observatory and the MeerKAT radio telescope have helped uncover the culprit behind one of the cracks.

The Role of the Pulsar in the Cosmic Collision

The source of the fracture has been identified as a radio pulsar. Pulsars are the remnants of massive stars that have ended their life cycles in violent supernova explosions. These remnants are incredibly dense neutron stars, spinning rapidly and emitting beams of radiation. The pulsar in question is thought to have been ejected from its original position after its parent star’s supernova underwent a “natal kick”—a powerful force that accelerated the pulsar across the galaxy at extreme speeds.

This pulsar’s trajectory led it straight into the Snake, where it smashed through the filament with incredible force. The collision caused a disruption of the magnetic field within the Snake, distorting the radio signals that are typically emitted from it. The surrounding area of the fracture shows an enhancement in X-ray emissions, a clear sign of accelerated electrons and positrons as a result of the pulsar’s impact.

Known as G359.13, this is one of several giant structures that resemble bones found near the center of our Milky Way Galaxy. Scientists recently discovered that this galactic ""bone,"" roughly 230 light-years long, has been fractured by a speeding pulsar: https://t.co/PUsVPMKR1h pic.twitter.com/fsyt75i1AF — Chandra Observatory (@chandraxray) May 1, 2025

Understanding Pulsar Behavior and Its Impact on the Filament

Pulsars are not typically associated with such dramatic interactions with their environments, but this discovery reveals the potential for pulsars to affect cosmic structures far beyond their immediate vicinity.

The acceleration of particles in the magnetic fields of the Snake is a direct consequence of the pulsar’s high-speed collision. This highlights a broader phenomenon in space, where fast-moving celestial objects, like pulsars and high-velocity stars, can create disturbances in their surroundings.

Astronomers are still investigating whether this pulsar’s journey could possibly take it out of the Milky Way. Given its high speed and current trajectory, it is a possibility, though the pulsar’s 26,000-light-year distance from Earth means it has a long way to travel before it would exit the galaxy.","Located at the galactic center, this 230-light-year-long filament has been struck by a pulsar moving at incredible speeds.

This potential “Theory of Everything” could answer some of the deepest mysteries in science—from black hole singularities to the origins of the universe—while inviting the global scientific community to contribute to the final proof.

A Long-Sought Breakthrough in Unifying Physics

After decades of searching, scientists may finally be closing in on one of the biggest mysteries in physics: how to unite gravity with the other fundamental forces of nature. For generations, physicists have struggled to reconcile two powerful yet incompatible theories—Einstein’s theory of gravity and quantum mechanics. Now, a major breakthrough from researchers in Finland could bring us one step closer to a long-sought “Theory of Everything.”

Physicists at Aalto University have developed a brand-new quantum theory of gravity that plays nicely with the Standard Model—the framework that describes all known particles and forces, except gravity. Their work could help scientists better understand cosmic puzzles like how the universe began or what really happens inside black holes. It might sound like deep theory, but advances like this often lead to real-world tech—after all, your phone’s GPS system wouldn’t work without Einstein’s theory of gravity.

New Paper Could Unlock Big Bang Mysteries

In a newly published paper in Reports on Progress in Physics, researchers Mikko Partanen and Jukka Tulkki lay out their groundbreaking theory. And the implications could be huge.

“If this turns out to lead to a complete quantum field theory of gravity, then eventually it will give answers to the very difficult problems of understanding singularities in black holes and the Big Bang,” he says.

“A theory that coherently describes all fundamental forces of nature is often called the Theory of Everything,” says Partanen, although he doesn’t like to use the term himself. “Some fundamental questions of physics still remain unanswered. For example, the present theories do not yet explain why there is more matter than antimatter in the observable universe.”

Cracking the Gravity Gauge Theory Puzzle

The key was finding a way to describe gravity in a suitable gauge theory — a kind of theory in which particles interact with each other through a field. “The most familiar gauge field is the electromagnetic field. When electrically charged particles interact with each other, they interact through the electromagnetic field, which is the pertinent gauge field,” explains Tulkki. “So when we have particles which have energy, the interactions they have just because they have energy would happen through the gravitational field.”

A challenge long facing physicists is finding a gauge theory of gravity that is compatible with the gauge theories of the other three fundamental forces — the electromagnetic force, the weak nuclear force and the strong nuclear force. The Standard Model of particle physics is a gauge theory that describes those three forces, and it has certain symmetries. “The main idea is to have a gravity gauge theory with a symmetry that is similar to the Standard Model symmetries, instead of basing the theory on the very different kind of spacetime symmetry of general relativity,” says Partanen, the study’s lead author.

Where Relativity and Quantum Theory Clash

Without such a theory, physicists cannot reconcile our two most powerful theories, quantum field theory and general relativity. Quantum theory describes the world of the very small—tiny particles interacting in probabilistic ways—while general relativity describes the chunkier world of familiar objects and their gravitational interaction. They are descriptions of our universe from different perspectives, and both theories have been confirmed to extraordinary precision—yet they are incompatible with each other. Furthermore, because gravitational interactions are weak, more precision is needed to study true quantum gravity effects beyond general relativity, which is a classical theory.

“A quantum theory of gravity is needed to understand what kind of phenomena there are in cases where there’s a gravitational field and high energies,” says Partanen. Those are the conditions around black holes and in the very early universe, just after the Big Bang—areas where existing theories in physics stop working.

Always fascinated with the very big questions of physics, he discovered a new symmetry-based approach to the theory of gravity and began to develop the idea further with Tulkki. The resulting work has great potential to unlock a whole new era of scientific understanding, in much the same way as understanding gravity paved the way to eventually creating GPS.

Open Invitation to the Scientific Community

Although the theory is promising, the duo point out that they have not yet completed its proof. The theory uses a technical procedure known as renormalization, a mathematical way of dealing with infinities that show up in the calculations. So far Partanen and Tulkki have shown that this works up to a certain point—for so-called ‘first order’ terms—but they need to make sure the infinities can be eliminated throughout the entire calculation. “If renormalization doesn’t work for higher order terms, you’ll get infinite results. So it’s vital to show that this renormalization continues to work,” explains Tulkki. “We still have to make a complete proof, but we believe it’s very likely we’ll succeed.”

Partanen concurs. There are still challenges ahead, he says, but with time and effort he expects they’ll be overcome. “I can’t say when, but I can say we’ll know much more about that in a few years.”

For now, they’ve published the theory as it stands, so that the rest of the scientific community can become familiar with it, check its results, help develop it further, and build on it.

Hope for a New Era of Discovery

“Like quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity before it, we hope our theory will open countless avenues for scientists to explore,” Partanen concludes.

Warming global temperatures and an increasing number of extreme weather events have made the pollen season in North America 20 days longer than it was in 1990, according to one 2021 study.

“Pollen seasons are effectively year-round in some parts of the country,” says Melanie Carver, the chief mission officer at the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America.

In the US and UK, seasonal allergies – also known as allergic rhinitis or hay fever – are usually triggered by tree pollen in the spring, grass pollen in the summer and weed pollen in the fall. About 26% of adults in both countries have a seasonal allergy, as do about 19% of children in the US and 10-15% of children in the UK.

As pollen seasons continue to get longer and more severe, how does one best manage allergies? We asked experts.

How do you know if you have seasonal allergies?

Common symptoms of pollen allergies include itchy, watery eyes, an itchy and runny nose, sneezing, nasal congestion and/or post-nasal drip (when mucus runs from the back of your nose down the throat), headaches, sore throat, coughing, wheezing and trouble breathing, says Dr Arveen Bhasin, an allergist-immunologist at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida.

It’s possible to develop allergies at any time.

“It’s not uncommon for adults that have never experienced them before to find themselves managing seasonal allergies for the first time later in life,” says Carver.

Moving to a new environment and encountering different foliage can trigger pollen allergies. It usually takes two years to develop sensitivities to particular allergens, says Dr Payel Gupta, a spokesperson for the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, and the medical director for allergy and immunology at Tono Health.

How do you treat seasonal allergies?

A number of over-the-counter medications can help manage allergy symptoms, says Bhasin. These include decongestants, antihistamine pills, nasal sprays and eye drops.

In order for these medications to work, says Bhasin, you have to be proactive and start your regimen at least two weeks before pollen season.

Bhasin notes that antihistamines can lose efficacy over time. If a medication “is not consistently controlling symptoms”, you “may have developed tolerance” to it, she says.

Additionally, nasal sprays need to be used regularly to be of any help. Bhasin says she often sees patients discontinue using nasal sprays after three to five days because they don’t seem to be working, but it takes 10-14 days of consistent use for these sprays to reach maximum efficacy.

Experts caution that when overused, decongestants can cause a rebound effect, where nasal congestion worsens. “Do not use them for more than three days,” says Carver, and check with your doctor before using if you have high blood pressure, heart disease, thyroid disease, glaucoma or trouble urinating.

“I really don’t understand why [decongestants] are over the counter, but they are,” says Gupta. “So people have to be careful.”

Lifestyle changes can reduce your exposure to pollen.

Inflammation and irritation are caused by pollen sitting on the surface of your skin or inside your nose and eyes, explains Gupta.

People spend as much as 90% of their time indoors, so it’s important to be mindful of how much pollen you are bringing inside, says Carver. At home, keep windows closed and the air conditioning running so that clean air can circulate. Make sure to regularly change air filters as well. When pollen counts are especially high, Carver suggests wearing a mask outside. And always remove your shoes, shower and change into a fresh set of clothes when you get home, experts say.

Air purifiers are also helpful, says Gupta, but getting one that is the right size for your space is important. The strength of a purifier is based on the square footage of a room, she explains.

When should you see a doctor?

If you have tried all the above and are still struggling with allergy symptoms, see an allergist.

“There are so many ways we can help you feel more comfortable,” says Gupta.

When over-the-counter drugs are not helping, allergists may prescribe allergy immunotherapy, meaning allergy shots or sublingual treatment (medicated drops that go under the tongue). These can help with longer-term control and relief, says Carter.","About 26% of adults in both countries have a seasonal allergy, as do about 19% of children in the US and 10-15% of children in the UK.

The North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services reported Sunday, May 11, that two unvaccinated people in Cass County were infected during international travel. One person has been hospitalized, according to a news release.

The two cases included an adult and child between the ages of 5 and 19 years old, according to the state’s measles website. They are not related to nine other cases that were reported this month in Williams County, home to Williston.

North Dakota law requires a school that has been exposed to a person with measles pull children from class for 21 days who do not have the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. That includes year-end celebrations, last day parties, field trips, graduation ceremonies and extracurricular activities, according to a letter to parents and guardians from West Fargo Public Schools.

“West Fargo Public Schools is committed to keeping our stakeholders informed and prepared,” the letter said. “While there is no cause for alarm at this time, we want you to be aware of the steps we are legally required to follow should a case occur.”

The state hasn’t required any schools in Cass County to pull students.

Fargo Public Schools said it has 297 children, or 2.6% of its student body, who are not vaccinated for measles. West Fargo Public Schools reported 303 students, or 2.3%. Moorhead has 237 students who are not vaccinated, or 3%.

Health officials recommend 95% of the population have the MMR vaccination to prevent widespread infection. North Dakota is at less than 90%, while Minnesota is at 86.5%. Cass County's vaccination rate is almost 93%. Clay is at 87%.

'Trying to carry on'

North Dakota health officials have ordered Williston Public Schools to pull unvaccinated students from Missouri Elementary School, Williston Middle School and Williston High School until late May.

Williston Public Schools has 150 children, or 2.8% of its student population, that do not meet MMR requirements, Williston Schools Superintendent Jason Germundson said.

The students who have been pulled from schools are using virtual learning to stay involved, he said.

Germundson said his district doesn't plan to cancel any sporting events, proms or graduation. The Western Dakota Association, the high school athletic conference Williston competes in, is on board with letting Williston continue to send student athletes to competitions, he said.

Graduation will happen May 25, after the quarantine period for unvaccinated students is over, he said.

“We’re trying to carry on as business as usual,” he told The Forum.

The last day of school for Williston is May 23.

“If we can get through the next 10 days without any incidents, then we’ll be good,” he said.

Area schools not impacted now

Moorhead Public Schools follows the Minnesota Department of Health’s guidance, district spokeswoman Brenda Richman said. It also “proactively and continuously reviews” its students’ vaccination status and hosts vaccine events, she said.

“This provides a convenient and accessible option for families,” Richman said. “MAPS (Minnesota Area Public Schools) health services department consistently provides family outreach and education on the importance of vaccinations.""

Moorhead’s last day of school is May 30, with graduation planned for that evening, according to its school calendar.

Fargo Public Schools, West Fargo Public Schools and Moorhead Public Schools say there have been no measles exposures in their school facilities.

Fargo Public Schools spokeswoman AnnMarie Campbell said her district is working with Fargo Cass Public Health.

“If a case of measles would be reported among our student body, we would take direction from FCPH and state health officials on any impacts to our schools,” Campbell said in a statement.

Fargo’s last day is June 5, with graduation on June 6 and 8. West Fargo’s last day is May 22 and graduation is on May 25.

“All graduation ceremonies, sports and year-end events are moving forward as planned, and we do not have any concerns at this time,” West Fargo Schools spokeswoman Heather Leas said.

Keeping informed

Williston Schools has been preparing for measles for about a month before it arrived, said Lynn Douglas, nursing director for the district. Officials there used social media, local media outlets, emails and other messaging to keep parents informed about the highly contagious respiratory disease, what the school is required to do and how to prepare for it.

“We like to keep our parents, guardians and employees aware of any possible thing that could happen,” she said. “Regularly throughout the year, we do send out information.”

Measles has just arrived in Cass County, but state health officials say they have been preparing for months to prevent the spread of the virus that was once believed to be eradicated in the United States.

Similarly, Fargo Cass Public Health has been gearing up for the anticipated arrival of measles since the first U.S. cases were reported this year, FCPH Director Jenn Faul said.

“There was increasing outreach to the school systems to look at their vaccination rates and to encourage vaccinations,” she said.

The agency also reached out to child care providers, FCPH immunization coordinator Cheryl Wavrin said.

Fargo Cass Public Health will host a walk-in clinic for the MMR vaccination from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m. Thursday at its 1240 25th St. S. Fargo location, Wavrin said. People should bring insurance cards, but those who don’t have insurance can apply for the vaccines for children program, which provides federal assistance at no cost to eligible children. A similar program exists for adults, according to North Dakota Health and Human Services.

“We will not turn anyone away if you don’t have health insurance,” Wavrin said.

Patients also can make appointments with FCPH by calling 701-241-1383, Wavrin said.

The agency also has delivered the MMR vaccine to schools in Cass County so parents can inoculate their children there, Faul said.

Clay County Public Health offers state-supplied vaccinations for its residents, including those in Moorhead.

Residents in Minnesota and North Dakota can check their vaccination records with the Docket app, which can be found at hhs.nd.gov/IRR. North Dakotans also can update records at that site, while Minnesotans can find more information at health.state.mn.us/people/immunize/miic/records.html.

Editor’s note: The podcast Chasing Life With Dr. Sanjay Gupta explores the medical science behind some of life’s mysteries big and small. You can listen to episodes here.

Hot flashes and night sweats. Light, heavy or skipped periods. Mood swings and brain fog. Sleepless nights. Changes to hair and skin.

These can all be symptoms of the menopause transition, a natural process that a woman goes through as her brain and body wind down and eventually shut off the ability to reproduce.

But honest and open discussions about menopause and the years leading up to it — called perimenopause — have, until recently, been nonexistent. Women’s experience have been either ignored or superficially played out in public for laughs, often resulting in a shroud of secrecy and feelings of shame.

Treating menopause as taboo even made the process a mystery to the very people going through it.

“When I first started to notice changes in my body, I was probably … 46, 47-ish,” Emmy-award winning comedian and writer Samantha Bee told CNN Medical Correspondent Meg Tirrell recently on the podcast Chasing Life With Dr. Sanjay Gupta. “And I was starting to do my own show. ‘Full Frontal’ had just kind of started, and I was under just … immense amounts of stress, no question.

“And I really started to feel like I was not coping well,” she said. “My body was changing — I was having physical changes — and I actually, literally didn’t know what was happening.”

Bee, who rose to fame first as a correspondent on “The Daily Show With Jon Stewart” and later with her own series, “Full Frontal With Samantha Bee,” said she would stop getting her period for a couple of months here and there. Her hair also started falling out in a way that didn’t feel typical. And she developed frozen shoulder, started sweating at night and was on an emotional roller coaster with her insides “roiling.”

Because the majority of her friends are a little younger than she is, Bee said she thought she was “going crazy” because of her job.

She finally confided in her gynecologist that she wasn’t sleeping well and “turning into Lady Macbeth.”

“And she was like, ‘Oh, you’re in perimenopause.’ And I was like, ‘There’s a word?’” Bee recounted, noting that at the time the topic hadn’t really broken the surface of popular culture.

“We’re all talking about it now, and you can read about it, and people are like, ‘Yeah!’ But eight years ago: zip, like zero information,” she recalled. “Nobody in the conversation. Not cool. Very unsexy. Mention it and you are just like a witch-crone who lives in a cave, don’t come out. … I would never in a million years have thought, ‘Oh, I’m in perimenopause.’”

You can listen to the full episode here.

Bee’s most recent project, “How to Survive Menopause,” was born out of her own bewildering experience. She performed her one-woman show in New York City in October 2024, where it was recorded live and adapted for audio by Audible.

Having a word and a framework for what she was going through, Bee said, helped put her “on a path of knowledge.”

“You’re de-pubertizing,” Bee said. Her doctor had this helpful guidance: “‘Remember all the torment you felt … when you were 15 and … every zit was an operatic tragedy? She was like, ‘That’s what that is, but just in the other direction.’”

The No. 1 thing that helped Bee most, she said, “is that you have to find a community of people that you can talk to, even if it’s just one person.”

“Just saying the words out loud and normalizing it. It’s normal. It literally happens to 50% of the population,” she said. “It’s good to make a joke about. It’s good to say it out loud. That’s actually the main thing that has helped me.”

What was not helpful, she said, was turning to social media. “I don’t like to take advice from people who are trying to sell me any type of product. Ever.”

Whom did Bee trust? For advice and guidance, in addition to her own doctor, she turned to a woman who has been called “the internet’s gynecologist,” Dr. Jen Gunter. Gunter, who authored the best-selling “The Menopause Manifesto: Own Your Health With Facts and Feminism,” is known for debunking myths about this stage of life.

“She told me that some of what happens when you are in perimenopause is that your brain is creating new neural pathways because it’s kind of cleaning itself out,” Bee said. “It’s kind of scrubbing out all of the neural pathways related to getting pregnant, feeding a baby, all of those early childhood, maternal pathways in your brain. It clears a little bit of space so it can be a time of tremendous creativity.”

Gunter, who said she likes to call it the “menopause experience” or the “menopause continuum,” agreed that we don’t talk enough about perimenopause and menopause.

“If you’ve never heard about it, how would you really know what’s going on with your body?” she told Tirrell on a separate episode of the Chasing Life podcast.

You can listen to the full episode here.

“A lot of women get their symptoms dismissed,” she said. “But also, the symptoms can be really nonspecific.”

For example, she said, women can have irregular periods, heavy bleeding, hot flashes and brain fog for other reasons. “So, there’s a combination of reasons that a lot of people don’t realize that’s what it is until they’re in the middle of it.”

How menopause is discussed in the wider culture can also be impactful.

“How you talk about something actually changes your thoughts about it,” Gunter pointed out.

“It means that we have a mind-body experience,” she said. “Everybody around you is telling you that you’re an ugly old hag whose ‘time has come,’ and all you’re seeing are 70-year-old men dating 20-year-old girls. … You could see how someone would feel worse about maybe the changes happening to their body.”

Gunter said we speak in euphemisms about men. “They have ‘erectile dysfunction.’ We don’t say ‘penile failure,’” Gunter said. “If we talked about men’s bodies the way we talked about women’s bodies, woof, that would be a whole different ball game.”

So, what do women need to know about the menopause experience? Here are Gunter’s top five facts.

The ‘what’ of menopause

Menopause marks the end of an individual’s reproductive years. The ovaries cease releasing eggs. “This is when ovulation stops,” Gunter said via email. “This means estrogen levels eventually decrease, and production of progesterone stops.”

But the progress is not gradual or linear. “Hormones can be chaotic in the time leading up to menopause, which is known as the menopause transition.”

Remember the chaos of puberty? “Think of menopause like puberty in reverse,” she said.

When does menopause start?

The menopause transition typically starts at the average age of 45, according to Gunter. “The average age of menopause 51 and the normal range is 45-55.”

“This means for some women symptoms may start in their early 40s, but for others there may be no symptoms until their late forties or even early 50s,” she added via email.

In other words, everybody is different, which makes it an unpredictable ride.

The diagnosis of menopause

Gunter explained that an individual reaches the milestone of menopause when she has not had a period for one year. “Menstrual irregularity is normal in the menopause transition, and when people are reliably skipping a period then menopause is likely 1-3 years away,” she said.

No blood or urine tests exist that can indicate whether someone is close to menopause, according to Gunter. Blood work isn’t even needed for the diagnosis. “If you are over age 45 and have gone a year without a period, that makes the diagnosis,” she said.

But sometimes more testing is required. “Blood work is indicated if someone is younger than age 45 and going 3 months or more between periods. The reason for the testing is to identify the cause of the irregular bleeding, and one cause may be premature menopause (age 40- 44) or primary ovarian insufficiency (under age 40),” she said.

For people who don’t get their periods for other reasons — due to using a hormone IUD or having had a hysterectomy — Gunter said doctors go by symptoms other than bleeding, for example hot flashes.

Symptoms and medical concerns

Symptoms can vary greatly from person to person, affect many body systems, and start and resolve at different times.

“The most common symptom in the menopause transition is irregular periods, but they can also be heavy,” Gunter said.

“Everyone is different. Hot flashes and night sweats are common symptoms,” she noted. “Depression, brain fog and joint pain can happen as well. Vaginal dryness, pain with sex and an increased risk of urinary tract infections are also common concerns.”

Menopause also ushers in some physical vulnerabilities. “The risk of osteoporosis increases with menopause. Menopause also marks a time when there is a change in the risk of diabetes and heart disease, so it’s important to be checked for diabetes, have your blood pressure checked and also your cholesterol and lipids,” she said.

A variety of treatment options

The best therapies for you will depend on your symptoms and health risks, Gunter said.

“Menopause hormone therapy (also known as hormone replacement therapy) is the gold standard for hot flashes and night sweats, and for women who choose this therapy, it should be an FDA-approved product,” she said via email. “Hormone pellets and compounded hormones are not FDA-approved and not recommended as the dosing is inconsistent and can lead to unnecessary and serious health concerns.

“Many women have heard the word bioidentical, but it is a marketing term. That being said, women should know that most hormones approved by the FDA are bioidentical,” she said.

Should all women entering menopause be on it? “We do not recommend that every woman take menopause hormone therapy, rather (that) it be prescribed for specific reasons where we have data to show it works or that is biologically plausible that it could help,” Gunter explained.

Getting enough exercise is important throughout life, but maybe more so as one ages. Taras Grebinets/iStockphoto/Getty Images

There are several key lifestyle opportunities as well, Gunter said, such as not smoking and eating a balanced, healthy diet. She recommends aiming for 25 grams of fiber every day.

“It’s also important to do resistance training and do aerobic exercise, as this improves many health domains,” she said, noting, however, that there is no need to go overboard by, say, running marathons or engaging in competitive weight lifting if you don’t already enjoy these activities.

To maintain physical fitness, aging adults can follow the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity weekly and two days per week of muscle-strengthening activities of moderate intensity.

“There are no menopause-specific supplements that have been shown in rigorous studies to help with symptoms. Considering the menopause gold rush, I recommend people steer clear of those who sell supplements as their content online is almost always geared for sales, not education,” she said.

But if a person has a specific health concern, such as low iron or low vitamin D levels, Gunter said in the podcast, a supplement can be of value. Look for one that has been certified by a third party, such as US Pharmacopeia (USP) or the NSF (the National Sanitation Foundation).

Vaccine experts are perplexed by a project the Trump administration has launched to develop a universal flu vaccine, which has long been a goal, though an elusive one, in medical research.

Dubbed Generation Gold Standard, the project is aimed at creating a flu shot that doesn't have to be updated every year to match the latest strains of the virus. The project also aims to produce a vaccine that could protect people against other respiratory viruses that could cause a pandemic, such as bird flu and coronaviruses.

""Generation Gold Standard is a paradigm shift,"" said National Institutes of Heath Director Jay Bhattacharya in a statement announcing the project. ""It extends vaccine protection beyond strain-specific limits and prepares for flu viral threats — not just today's, but tomorrow's as well — using traditional vaccine technology brought into the 21st century.""

The announcement surprised vaccine researchers, given the anti-vaccine stance of health officials like Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

""I'm glad to see that this administration is still wanting to invest in developing next-generation influenza vaccines or respiratory vaccines in general,"" says Ted Ross, director of Global Vaccine Development at the Cleveland Clinic.

An old vaccine technology back in the spotlight

But Ross and other outside vaccine experts are mystified by many aspects of Generation Gold Standard.

First of all, the project plans to use an approach that would involve injecting people with a whole flu virus that has been killed with a chemical to render it harmless but is still capable of stimulating the immune system. Most vaccine experts consider the whole killed virus approach to be antiquated.

""This a head-scratcher to me. This is puzzling,"" says Dr. Gregory Poland, a vaccine expert who leads the Atria Academy of Science and Medicine in New York.

""We're going back to technology that was used 40, 50 years ago or more. So this is a little surprising to me why you would go backwards to this technology? It's a very old technology,"" Poland says. ""This is what influenza vaccines in the 40s, 50s and 60s looked like.""

Sponsor Message

Whole dead virus vaccines tend to produce more side effects, including high fevers and seizures that especially can frighten parents, Poland, Ross and others say. Newer, more advanced technologies are showing more promise with fewer side effects, they say.

""We have live attenuated nasal spray influenza vaccines. We have recombinant influenza vaccines. We have an mRNA-based influenza vaccine,"" Poland says. ""So why would you put all your eggs in one basket?""

A pricey bet on a single approach

And then there's the price tag: $500 million, which is a huge amount, especially at a time when federal health research funding is being slashed. The money that was originally earmarked to help explore a variety of technologies for next-generation COVID-19 vaccines.

""This amount of money is astronomical. It is foolish to put that much money onto one technology,"" says Rick Bright, a former federal vaccine expert who is now a private consultant. ""What we need now is bold 21st century solutions, not a retreat into nostalgia.""

Another aspect that's raising eyebrows is the fact that the technology — called a ""beta-propiolactone (BPL)-inactivated, whole-virus platform"" — was developed by two NIH scientists — Dr. Matthew Memoli and Dr. Jeffery Taubenberger.

Memoli was recently named as the principal deputy director of the NIH after serving as Trump's acting NIH director. Taubenberger was recently named acting director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Taubenberger holds a patent on the technology. In addition, the strategy was picked without independent, public review and based on only very limited preliminary testing.

""So that's odd,"" says Dr. Jesse Goodman, a former Food and Drug Administration vaccine expert who's now at Georgetown University. ""If you're going to do this, have an open scientific competition for the best ideas. There should be transparency for the process of how to allot funding.""

The Department of Health and Human Services confirmed the cost of the project and answered a question about the two vaccine candidates being explored, but didn't answer additional questions from NPR about the project, including why officials picked this approach and how the effort was vetted.

But in announcing it, the administration said a universal flu vaccine should be ready for widescale testing next year and could be available to the public within four years, which is a very ambitious timeline.

May 12 (UPI) -- U.S. health officials are advising patients using the drug Ixchiq to hold off while authorities seek newer information on vaccine results in the global fight against chikungunya.

The pause for U.S. patients was initiated Friday by the FDA and CDC while the two federal agencies investigate ""postmarketing reports of serious adverse events, including neurologic and cardiac events, in individuals who have received the vaccine"" Ixchiq, otherwise known as live ""Chikungunya Vaccine,"" according to a safety communication by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

In November 2023, the FDA approved Ixchiq for the prevention of disease caused by the chikungunya virus in patients age 18 years and older.

On Friday, health officials said the FDA will conduct an updated benefit-risk assessment for the use of Ixchiq in individuals 60 years of age and older after over 80,000 doses of Ixchiq were distributed worldwide.

Since the start of this year, roughly 80,000 cases and 46 CHIKVD-related deaths have been reported in 14 countries or territories, says the EU-backed European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

FDA officials said as of Wednesday that 17 ""serious adverse events"" were reported globally in people over age 62 who got Ixchiq, with two reported deaths. Of the 17 reports, six were U.S.-based, but American health officials did not indicate if any of those deaths were in the United States.

However, officials pointed out that reported adverse events ""may not be causally related to vaccination.""

According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the virus is transmitted by mosquitoes and the symptoms can last anywhere from one week to several months.

Like dengue fever, chikungunya virus causes high fever, rashes, headache and joint pain. And while most patients recover with days, the joint pain can persist for months that can be managed with pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory medications.

But while it has the potential to temporarily disable a victim, it does not often result in death.

The single-dose shot approved November 2023 by the federal government was for use in adults with an increased risk of exposure to the chikungunya virus.

Mosquitoes can infect people with Zika and chikungunya viruses at the same time, research has suggested, and may cause fatal brain infection which hit 24 victims by November 2015.

The virus was observed and described in U.S. patients who traveled from the Caribbean area to Georgia and North Carolina as chikungunya hit Cuba around May 2014.

Chikungunya, an illness caused by a virus spread via mosquito bites but not by person-to-person contact, was first detected in the Americas near the end of 2013 as it swiftly spread to other Caribbean nations, Africa and Asia.

However, no cases have been reported on Europe's mainland.

Friday's federal advisory on Ixchiq arrived amid a crackdown on vaccine use and its pertinent studies lead by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a known critic of effective and long-existing vaccines.

Researchers analyzed health data from over 142,000 adults and found that certain multimorbidity profiles more than doubled the chance of a depression diagnosis within 10 years.

Women with joint or bone issues and individuals with chronic lung, liver, or bowel conditions were also at elevated risk. The findings highlight the need for integrated care models that address both mental and physical health in tandem.

People with multiple long-term physical health conditions are at a significantly greater risk of developing depression, a study shows.

Researchers found that some combinations of illnesses – particularly cardiometabolic ones like diabetes and heart disease – could more than double the likelihood of a future depression diagnosis.

With multimorbidity – when patients live with two or more chronic conditions – continuing to put pressure on an already stretched healthcare system, experts say the findings highlight the need for integrated care models that address both mental and physical health.

Researchers from the University of Edinburgh used data from more than 142,000 people in the UK Biobank study to examine how physical illnesses interact to influence the risk of depression – a condition that often goes underdiagnosed in people managing long-term physical diseases.

Participants were aged 37-73 years and had at least one chronic physical condition but no history of depression.

Scientists used statistical clustering techniques to group individuals by their physical illness profiles and tracked how these clusters related to later diagnoses of depression.

One group, which included people experiencing the highest rates of physical illness also showed the highest risk of developing depression. This group had no single dominant illness, but rather a complex mix of issues.

People with both heart disease and diabetes were also found to be at high risk, as were those with chronic lung conditions like asthma or COPD – chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Liver and bowel conditions also showed a noticeable link to depression in both men and women.

Women with joint and bone problems, such as arthritis, were particularly affected, but this pattern was not as prominent for men.

In the highest-risk groups, about one in 12 people developed depression over the next 10 years, compared with about one in 25 people without physical conditions.

While the biological burden of illness may play a role, researchers say social and systemic factors could also help explain why physical multimorbidity leads to worse mental health outcomes.

Lauren DeLong, lead author and PhD student at the University of Edinburgh’s School of Informatics, said: “We saw clear associations between physical health conditions and the development of depression, but this study is only the beginning.

“We hope our findings inspire other researchers to investigate and untangle the links between physical and mental health conditions.”

Bruce Guthrie, Professor of General Practice at the University of Edinburgh’s Advanced Care Research Centre, said: “Healthcare often treats physical and mental health as completely different things, but this study shows that we need to get better at anticipating and managing depression in people with physical illness.”

Professor Mike Lewis, NIHR’s Scientific Director of Innovation, said: “Harnessing the power of data to understand the impact of chronic conditions is going to transform the way we treat patients in the future.

“NIHR’s research in this area is helping to paint a full picture of what patients are dealing with, rather than just focusing on one health condition at a time.”

“Cluster and survival analysis of UK biobank data reveals associations between physical multimorbidity clusters and subsequent depression” by Lauren DeLong et al. Nature Communications Medicine

Abstract

Cluster and survival analysis of UK biobank data reveals associations between physical multimorbidity clusters and subsequent depression

Background

Multimorbidity, the co-occurrence of two or more conditions within an individual, is a growing challenge for health and care delivery as well as for research. Combinations of physical and mental health conditions are highlighted as particularly important. Here, we investigated associations between physical multimorbidity and subsequent depression.

Methods

We performed a clustering analysis upon physical morbidity data for UK Biobank participants aged 37–73. Of 502,353 participants, 142,005 had linked general practice data with at least one baseline physical condition. Following stratification by sex (77,785 women; 64,220 men), we used four clustering methods and selected the best-performing based on clustering metrics.

We used Fisher’s Exact test to determine significant over-/under-representation of conditions within each cluster. Amongst people with no prior depression, we used survival analysis to estimate associations between cluster-membership and time to subsequent depression diagnosis.

Results

Our results show that the k-modes models perform best, and the over-/under-represented conditions in the resultant clusters reflect known associations. For example, clusters containing an overrepresentation of cardiometabolic conditions are amongst the largest (15.5% of whole cohort, 19.7% of women, 24.2% of men).

Cluster associations with depression vary from hazard ratio 1.29 (95% confidence interval 0.85–1.98) to 2.67 (2.24–3.17), but almost all clusters show a higher association with depression than those without physical conditions.

Conclusions

We show that certain groups of physical multimorbidity may be associated with a higher risk of subsequent depression. However, our findings invite further investigation into other factors, such as social considerations, which may link physical multimorbidity with depression.","Summary: A new study reveals that people with multiple chronic physical conditions face a significantly higher risk of developing depression, especially when conditions like heart disease and diabetes co-occur.

2025-05-14 00:56:39+01:00,2025-05-14 07:56:39 +08,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14707401/skinny-1960s-nutritionist-reveals-slimming-secrets.html,Why were we so skinny in the 1960s? Nutritionist reveals slimming secrets of the past,"It's no secret that everything is bigger nowadays.

Whether it's houses, TVs or cars - compared to decades ago, things have gone supersized.

And that includes serving sizes and waistlines.

In 2024, 43 percent of Americans were considered obese, compared to just 13 percent in the 1960s.

Experts have blamed an increased intake of ultra processed foods and meals with more calories and warned obesity can lead to a range of health problems, including heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, liver disease, sleep apnea and certain cancers.

And now, California-based nutritionist Autumn Bates has revealed what she believes is driving the obesity epidemic, detailing four reasons as to why people were slimmer in decades gone by, despite exercising less or not having access to fitness monitors like Apple Watches and FitBits.

She says she decided to investigate this phenomenon after watching a YouTube short recently that asked the question why were we so skinny in the 1960s?

The nutritionist said: '[This is a] fair question because in the 60s we had an obesity rate in America of about 13 percent.

'To put that into perspective now currently as of 2025 we have an obesity rate that is closing in on 43 percent and this is all kind of wild because it's not like people were known in the 60s for their healthy food choices.

'So why in the world did we have such lower body fat percentages back in the 60s?'

While it's easy to look at the past with rose tinted glasses, scientists say it's a cold hard fact that we were much skinnier in the past than today. Above, sunbathers sit in deckchairs at Virginia Beach in the 1960s

The first driving factor behind the rise in obesity is the decline in home-cooked, fresh meals. These used to be the rule; not the exception.

They traditionally featured 'some type of really high quality protein, some fruit, some bread, some veggies and then probably milk.'

She explains this same nutritious formula applied to children's packed lunches for school, so kids were getting more of a balanced diet compared to today.

From her research looking at what people ate in the 1960s, Ms Bates says some of the popular items included roast chicken, meatloaf, beef stew, steak and potatoes.

There was little mention of fast food, which has seen a surge in serving sizes - with calorie counts reaching nearly 2,000 for a serving of popular burgers and fries.

From personal interactions with her family, she said in a YouTube video: 'My dad said that they would pretty much always have like pot roast and my mom has a very specific, not fond, memory of lima [or butter] beans.'

Ms Bates says the benefits of meals prepared at home include a lower sugar intake, extra protein and an increased amount of vegetables.

A previous study from Johns Hopkins University found people who frequently cook their meals at home tend to consume fewer carbohydrates, less sugar, and less fat compared to those who don't cook as often.

Next, Ms Bates says another reason why today's society is fatter than ever is because of the explosion of ultra processed foods.

Ultra processed foods, or UPFs, is an umbrella term used to cover anything with a long ingredients list or made with artificial additives like colorings, sweeteners and preservatives that extend shelf life.

Ready meals, ice cream and ketchup are some of the most-loved examples of products that fall under the UPF term, now synonymous with foods offering little nutritional value.

They are different to processed foods, which are tinkered to make them last longer or enhance their taste, such as cured meat, cheese and fresh bread.

Explaining why UPFs are bad, she says: 'Ultra processed is the next level of processing that really strips down the satiety and make you so much less satisfied from your food and therefore [you] need to eat even more.

'These are foods that are primarily going to have ingredients that you don't recognize and typically a long list of ingredients that you would not be able to just get your grocery store and recreate at home.'

Ms Bates says it is estimated that 70 percent of Americans' diet today is made up of UPFs and 'some studies have found that these ultra processed foods can make us eat about 800 calories more a day because they are so much less satisfying.'

California-based nutritionist Autumn Bates (pictured above) reveals that in the 1960s America had an obesity rate of around 13 percent but today that number has more than tripled, with it now ballooning at 43 percent

The third thing that contributed to a slimmer society in the 1960s, Ms Bates says is that people were 'a lot more accidentally active'

Ms Bates advises avoiding the fattening impact of these foods and swap them out for healthier alternatives - packaged snacks with added ingredients can be swapped for fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds.

The third thing that contributed to a slimmer society in the 1960s, Ms Bates says is that people were 'a lot more accidentally active'.

She continues: 'A large portion of the workforce back then had more physically demanding jobs. They also had a lot less structured activity, meaning that they didn't really work out.

'My dad will always say that he was super embarrassed when he was younger because his dad was a health nut at the time and would go for runs and his friends would make fun of him and ask what he was running from because people had more active jobs.

'They had a full day where they were more active versus a full day of sitting in front of a computer screen and then also probably commuting.'

Ms Bates notes with the rise of technology, people have become more housebound and glued to their screens, so they are getting less physical activity.

She adds: 'My mom said that if you had to stay inside, that was a punishment when she was a kid. Kids back in the 60s really didn't have anything inside that would entertain them as much, so they had to go outside and be active and play.'

For people who have computer based jobs, Ms Bates suggests getting a walking desk, so you can walk on a treadmill while you type and keep trim.

On top of this, she recommends three to four days of structured exercise per week, such as strength training.

Lastly, Ms Bates points to a lack of sleep as another problem driving America's obesity epidemic.

Today the average American adult gets around 7 hours and 10 minutes of sleep per night and successful modern day individuals like Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey and President Donald Trump have claimed that 4 hours is the optimal amount of sleep.

This compares to the 1960s, when studies show the average was closer to 8.5 hours.

Commenting on this shift in sleeping patterns, Ms Bates says: 'Less sleep is significantly tied with obesity and weight gain.

'Low sleep causes increased hunger hormones so you're going to feel a lot more hungry the next day.

'It also increases our preferences for sweet foods and it increases our preferences for larger portion sizes.'

The nutritionist blames technology for hampering peoples' ability to sleep, with more distractions at nighttime in the form of things such as laptops, TVs and phones.

She adds: 'Plus people were more active throughout the day which meant that they were more tired and actually did want to go to sleep.

'We need to set bed times again for ourselves because there are so many different temptations to stay up late whether it be like binge watching a Netflix show or just scrolling on your phone.

'We need to actually set time limits for when we're going to be going to sleep.'","From her research looking at what people ate in the 1960s, Ms Bates says some of the popular items included roast chicken, meatloaf, beef stew, steak and potatoes.

Nearly 19 million children in the United States have at least one parent with a substance use disorder, according to a new study published Monday in JAMA Pediatrics. And a significant number of those children have a parent whose addiction is moderate or severe as opposed to mild, the study finds.

The number amounts to 1 in 4 children with a parent who has addiction.

""I'm an addiction doc, and so I think about this issue all the time,"" says Dr. Scott Hadland, chief of adolescent medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital, who wasn't involved in the new study. ""Even still, I was surprised at how high that percentage was. It's just an enormous number of kids that are affected.""

""If one-quarter of kids in the U.S. have a parent with a substance use disorder, that tells us that every day in our clinics we are encountering many, if not dozens of families that are affected by substance use disorders,"" he adds. ""And we need to be poised and ready to help support those families.""

The new study used data from the 2023 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, a federal survey that estimated the prevalence of substance use and mental health disorders based on the most updated criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 (DSM-5). The national survey is managed by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, but the team in charge of the survey was let go as part of the recent reduction in force. It is unclear how the cuts will affect the future of the survey.

The study's main finding is significantly higher than previous estimates (7 million in a study originally published in 2022), which had relied on diagnostic criteria from the DSM-IV.

The new study also estimated how many children have a parent with a moderate or severe addiction as opposed to mild.

""We also found that 7.6 million children live in a household with a parent that has either a moderate or severe substance use disorder,"" says study author Sean Esteban McCabe, director of the Center for the Study of Drugs, Alcohol, Smoking and Health at the University of Michigan. ""And 3.4 million live with a parent with multiple substance use disorders.""

McCabe and his team also found that more than 6 million children have a parent with a mental health condition in addition to a substance use disorder.

""These estimates are incredibly important to understand the scope of parental substance use disorder in the United States,"" wrote Dr. Davida Schiff in an email. Schiff is a pediatrician and addiction medicine physician at Massachusetts General Hospital and wasn't involved in the new study.

Another notable finding in the study, according to Schiff, is that a majority of the parents — 12 million — had alcohol use disorder. ""While alcohol is more socially acceptable in our society, the study points to a need to pay greater attention to a rising number of children exposed to parental alcohol use disorder.""

""It's also important to remember that alcohol is actually the leading cause of substance-related deaths in the United States,"" notes Hadland. ""It actually kills more people in the U.S. than do opioids every year, but it's a slower death rate. It's a chronic disease process that affects, you know, somebody's liver, somebody's risk of developing cancer.""

And children of parents with addiction are themselves at a higher risk of various physical and mental health problems.

""Young children growing up in homes affected by parental SUD (substance use disorder) are at increased risk of experiencing impaired caregiving, disruption of parental abilities, unintentional ingestions, and witnessing parental overdose,"" wrote Schiff.

They are also at a higher risk of developing certain mental health conditions and substance use problems in the long run.

""One thing that I'm doing as a pediatrician is when I'm caring for a young person who has a parent with a substance use disorder, is making sure that I'm doing a good job asking about and screening for mental health concerns like depression, anxiety, ADHD, all of which we know can be more common in kids of parents with addiction,"" says Hadland.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that pediatricians ask patients and/or parents about substance use in the family in order to educate them about the risks of substance use and connect families to treatment when needed.

""We as pediatricians and family medicine doctors might think about screening parents for substance use and substance use disorders when they come into our clinics to help make sure that we can identify problems and get parents connected to treatment, because that's probably in the best interest of their child,"" says Hadland.

Pediatric clinics affiliated with Mass General Brigham in the Boston area use a developmental screening that includes questions about parental substance use, wrote Schiff.

Parents with addiction love their children and want the best for them, she says, but may not access treatment because of stigma about seeking help for addiction and barriers to accessing care.

For parents with substance use disorder, Schiff says, she and her colleagues ""discuss safe storage of substances, identification of a safe and sober caregiver for children during periods of active use, and provide training in naloxone administration should an unintentional ingestion occur.""

As for parents with addiction who have infants, she recommends avoiding breastfeeding after using substances and discusses safe sleep practices ""to prevent unsafe sleep injuries and infant suffocation.""

""We know that over three-fourths of people with substance use disorders do not get treatment,"" says McCabe. ""And kids who are in households with parents that don't get help are much less likely to get help themselves. So I just think it's important for us who serve and provide care to children to understand what these numbers mean and also how we can design programs to meet these kids where they're at.""","A quarter of children have a parent with substance use disorder, a study findstoggle caption Olekcii Mach/Getty Images/iStockphotoNearly 19 million children in the United States have at least one parent with a substance use disorder, according to a new study published Monday in JAMA Pediatrics.

2025-05-13 16:20:41+01:00,2025-05-13 23:20:41 +08,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14707019/doctors-screen-pregnant-women-std-cause-birth-defects.html,Doctors officially told to start screening ALL pregnant women for frightening STD in bombshell move,"Every pregnant woman should get screened for an STD linked to rising rates of stillbirths and defects in babies, according to an influential medical panel.

The US Preventive Services Task Force, which sets clinical care guidelines for the country, issued new guidance today calling on doctors to screen for syphilis throughout pregnancies.

Syphilis is a bacterial infection that women can pass to their babies in utero, known as congenital syphilis, which can interfere with the fetus' development.

Rates of the STD have been rising rapidly in recent years thanks to a combination of missed testing, treatment and prenatal care gaps, substance use, social stigma, and testing delays.

In 2023, the US reported nearly 4,000 cases of congenital syphilis, up more than a third from 2021 and 10 times higher than a decade ago.

There were also 279 congenital syphilis-related stillbirths in 2023, the highest number reported in 30 years.

A 2018 federal recommendation urged all pregnant women to be screened for the disease, but the USPSTF is emphasizing its importance by reissuing this recommendation given the upticks in cases and still births.

Women are already recommended to get screened from the disease early, at their very first visit with a gynecologist weeks of pregnancy - between eight and 12.

Women are recommended to get screened from the disease early, at their very first visit with a gynecologist weeks of pregnancy - between eight and 12. This applies to women who have been previously tested for syphilis

But the UPSTF also recommended screening at 28 weeks' gestation and a third time at delivery.

Revealing the guidance, members of the task force said: '[We] conclude with high certainty that screening for syphilis infection in pregnancy has a substantial net benefit.'

They added: 'Rates of new syphilis cases have continued to rise over the past three decades, especially in women.

'Although men account for the majority of syphilis cases, the change in incidence among women was 2 to 4 times higher than that among men between 2017 and 2021.'

Congenital syphilis can cause severe long-term problems for the baby. They may be born too early, too small, or stillborn.

Newborns with the infection can have life-threatening complications such as severe anemia, swollen liver and spleen, yellowing skin (jaundice), and bone deformities.

The infection can also cause brain and nerve damage, leading to inflammation of the covering around nerves, blindness, and permanent hearing loss.

The USPSTF said: 'A recent analysis of national data from 2022 found that 5 percent of congenital syphilis cases (197/3761 cases) occurred in late pregnancy after having had a negative syphilis screening result earlier in pregnancy.

In 2023, states and DC reported nearly 4,000 cases of congenital syphilis. This marks a 3 percent rise from 2022, following a 32 percent surge from 2021 to 2022.

'Similar to the disparities seen in the burden of syphilis, 40.6 percent of these cases occurred in Black women, 28.4 percent occurred in Hispanic or Latina women, and 19.8 percent occurred in White women.'

Some retrospective studies estimate that 25 percent to 50 percent of congenital syphilis cases could be prevented by repeat screening in the third trimester of pregnancy.

The task force added: Congenital syphilis increased more than 10-fold over a recent decade, from 334 cases in 2012 to 3882 cases in 2023.

Your browser does not support iframes.

'It is estimated that almost 90 percent of new congenital syphilis cases could have been prevented with timely testing and treatment.'

The infection can be cured in utero with consistent treatment with the antibiotic penicillin, ideally before the second trimester.

A 2014 systematic review of 54 observational studies found that the incidence of congenital syphilis, preterm birth, low birth weight, stillbirth, and newborn infant death was dramatically reduced in pregnant women treated for syphilis during pregnancy compared with those who had untreated syphilis.

Screening for congenital syphilis involves a blood test that detects antibodies that may reflect infection with Treponema pallidum, the organism that causes syphilis.

Most states mandate screening for syphilis in all pregnant women at the first prenatal visit, and some mandate repeat screening early in the third trimester and at delivery.

During pregnancy, the body goes through many changes that can sometimes cause false positives on syphilis screening tests.

These tests look for signs of tissue damage, not just syphilis itself. Pregnancy can trigger similar reactions because of hormonal shifts, immune system adjustments, or other conditions like autoimmune diseases.

A positive result on the first test doesn’t always mean syphilis—it needs a second, more specific test to confirm.

The infection is spread through contact with fecal matter. Unhoused people are more likely to experience the dangerous infection given lack of easy access to handwashing and public restrooms.

Infection is also more common in women living in areas where cases are generally high, those with a history of HIV, incarceration, or sex work.

'Clinicians should be aware of the prevalence of syphilis infection in the communities they serve and state mandates for syphilis screening,' the task force said.","They added: 'Rates of new syphilis cases have continued to rise over the past three decades, especially in women.

The health agency said the Canadian resident spent time in western Washington between April 30 and May 3 and visited “multiple public locations in Renton, Bellevue, Seattle, Everett and Woodinville while contagious with measles, but before being diagnosed with measles.”

Health officials said the person’s vaccine status is unknown, and this case is not connected to any previous local measles cases. Measles can spread before a rash appears and people know they have the disease.

, the Canadian resident visited the 16 locations listed below. The times listed include the estimated time the person was at the location and two hours after since the measles virus can remain airborne for up to two hours after an infected person leaves the area:

on April 30 - May 3 from 9 a.m. through 10 a.m.

on April 30 from noon to 3:30 p.m.

on April 30 from 2-5 p.m.

on April 30 from 4-8 p.m.

on May 2 from 8:30-11:30 p.m.

(Gate S1)on May 3 from 8:30 a.m. – 1:30 p.m.

Most residents in western Washington are immune to the disease through vaccination. According to Public Health – Seattle and King County, anyone who visited the locations above during the listed times and is not immune to measles will “most likely” become sick between May 7 – 24.

“Globally and in the U.S., we are experiencing a significant measles resurgence. With over 1,000 cases reported so far this year nationally, 2025 is on track to have the highest number of measles cases in the U.S. since the early 1990s,” said Meagan Kay, Medical Epidemiologist for Public Health – Seattle & King County. “It’s an important time to check your vaccination status and get vaccinated if you aren’t protected.”

What is measles?

Measles is a highly contagious and potentially severe respiratory disease. The virus is airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. The virus causes fever, rash, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes.

If one person has measles, Public Health – Seattle and King County said up to nine out of 10 people nearby will also become infected if they’re not protected.

Symptoms can begin between seven to 21 days after exposure. The virus is contagious from around four days before a rash appears through four days after it appears, and the virus can be spread before the “characteristic measles rash” appears, health officials said.

There’s no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable.

Can measles be fatal?

It usually doesn’t kill people, but it can.

Common complications include ear infections and diarrhea. But about 1 in 5 unvaccinated Americans who get measles are hospitalized, the CDC said. Pregnant women who haven’t gotten the vaccine may give birth prematurely or have a low-birthweight baby.

Among children with measles, about 1 in every 20 develops pneumonia, the CDC said, and about one in every 1,000 suffers swelling of the brain called encephalitis — which can lead to convulsions, deafness or intellectual disability.

How can you prevent measles?

The best way to avoid measles is to get the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old.

There is data on the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine because it's been around for decades.

Vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the COVID-19 pandemic, and most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners — the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.

Do you need a booster if you got the MMR vaccine a while ago?

Health care professionals are sometimes tested for antibodies to measles and given boosters if necessary, even if they’ve already had the standard two doses as a child.

Health officials said people at high risk for infection who got the shots many years ago may also want to consider getting a booster if they live in an area with an outbreak. Those may include family members living with someone who has measles or those especially vulnerable to respiratory diseases because of underlying medical conditions.","is warning the public after a Canadian resident visited over a dozen locations in King and Snohomish counties while infectious with measles.

Do your wrinkles always form in the same pattern every time you’re in the water for too long?

According to new research from Binghamton University, State University of New York, the answer is yes.

A couple of years ago, Binghamton University Associate Professor Guy German published research about why human skin wrinkles when you stay in the water too long.

Received wisdom held that the water swelled your skin and made your fingers wrinkly, but little to no research had been done to prove that.

What German and his team at the Biological Soft Matter Mechanics Laboratory found is that blood vessels beneath the skin actually contract after prolonged immersion, and that’s where the wrinkles come from.

He wrote about the research for The Conversation — a nonprofit news organization that asks academics to share their expertise on current topics — as part of its Curious Kids feature. One of the follow-up questions stumped him, though.

“A student asked, ‘Yeah, but do the wrinkles always form in the same way?’ And I thought: I haven’t the foggiest clue!” said German, a faculty member at the Thomas J. Watson College of Engineering and Applied Science’s Department of Biomedical Engineering. “So it led to this research to find out.”

In a paper recently published in the Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials, German and Rachel Laytin ’23, MS ’24, show that, yes, the topography patterns remain constant after multiple immersions.

“Blood vessels don’t change their position much — they move around a bit, but in relation to other blood vessels, they’re pretty static,” German said. “That means the wrinkles should form in the same manner, and we proved that they do.”

The research put subjects’ fingers in water for 30 minutes, taking photos and then repeating the immersion under the same conditions at least 24 hours later. By comparing the images, German and Laytin found the same patterns of raised loops and ridges after both immersions.

They also made an interesting side discovery: “We’ve heard that wrinkles don’t form in people who have median nerve damage in their fingers,” German said.

“One of my students told us, ‘I’ve got median nerve damage in my fingers.’ So we tested him — no wrinkles!”

As much fun as it was to figure out something a child asked, the research also could have real-world applications in forensics, such as fingerprinting at crime scenes and identifying bodies found after prolonged water exposure. German’s father, a retired U.K. police officer, faced some of these challenges during his law enforcement career.

“Biometrics and fingerprints are built into my brain,” he said. “I always think about this sort of stuff, because it’s fascinating.”

German is eager to further explore questions about skin immersion with his students: “I feel like a kid in a candy store, because there’s so much science here that I don’t know.

“We thank the people at The Conversation and the wonderful question they asked us, because does it create cool new science.”

“On the repeatability of wrinkling topography patterns in the fingers of water immersed human skin” by Guy German et al. Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials

Abstract

On the repeatability of wrinkling topography patterns in the fingers of water immersed human skin

Finger wrinkling during and after water immersion, often called pruning, is an evolutionary mechanism that increases grip strength in water.

Previous studies have determined that water-induced finger wrinkles result from vasoconstriction, or the tightening of blood vessels below the skin’s surface.

However, no previous studies have characterized the morphology of topographical finger wrinkles.

We anticipate that vasoconstriction also governs the morphology of finger wrinkles formed.

Since these constricting blood vessels are stationary, we expect the pattern created by topographical wrinkles formed to remain constant over time.

To evaluate pattern repeatability, images of human fingertips at two separate time points are overlaid and compared visually to establish corresponding wrinkle pairs.

Wrinkle pairs are vectorized with orientation correlations evaluated quantitatively using normalized dot products, then compared against randomly oriented control vectors.

The results demonstrate a significant relationship between wrinkle orientation across both time points and thus reveal the consistency of wrinkle morphology over time.","Summary: New research confirms that the wrinkles on your fingers after water exposure always form in the same pattern.

A new study sheds light on the powerful connection between social networks and health in later life and reveals a surprising path for improving health equity among older adults.

Published in the journal Innovation in Aging, the study tracked over 1,500 older adults for a decade using three rounds of data from the National Social Life, Health and Aging Project.

Led by Lissette Piedra, a professor of social work at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; and James Iveniuk, a senior research scientist at the University of Chicago’s National Opinion Research Center; the team identified three types of social networks — enriched, focused and restricted — that reflected how socially connected people were as they aged.

People in enriched networks — those marked by diverse, active relationships — reported the highest levels of self-rated health, a measure strongly associated with overall well-being.

Those in restricted networks — smaller, more isolated groups centered on family — reported significantly poorer health. Focused networks fell in between, providing emotional support but with limited breadth.

Individuals in the restricted group reported significantly poorer health at the beginning of the study. However, by the end, both those in the restricted and the focused groups showed worse health outcomes than people in the enriched group, though the differences had narrowed, according to the study.

“Social isolation and loneliness can have corrosive effects on mental and physical health,” said Piedra, who is also a professor of Latina/Latino Studies.

“Older adults’ social circles may shrink due to poor health, loss of loved ones, poverty, discrimination, language barriers or living in rural or unsafe communities.”

Those who were Black, Hispanic or from other minoritized racial and ethnic groups reported the highest levels of loneliness. Yet one of the most hopeful findings from the study was that some individuals were able to expand their networks over time, Piedra said.

Despite having the smallest networks, people in the focused group reported lower loneliness than those in the restricted group, suggesting that frequent, meaningful interactions can buffer the effects of limited network size.

It was also a high mobile group: More than 43% of people in the focused group moved into enriched networks during the study, and 22% transitioned into the more isolated restricted group.

By contrast, over 85% of those who began in the restricted group remained there, highlighting the stability — and vulnerability — of this network type, the researchers found.

“If you start off in a restricted network, the likelihood that you’re going to move out of it is low,” Piedra said. “Many people who are vulnerable — such as women and people of color — are more likely to see their social connections decline and become restricted over time.”

The study also found that women, Black participants and the oldest respondents were more likely to transition from enriched to focused networks, reflecting the compounding effects of aging, widowhood and structural barriers. Loss of a spouse or close friend can trigger a rapid contraction of one’s social circle, especially for those in tight-knit networks, Piedra said.

“If you’re an older woman and your social life revolved around your husband, his death may cause your network to decline,” Piedra explained.

“Similarly, living in a community with high crime, a rural area with few activities, having limited transportation or disability can all make it harder to stay socially connected.”

Piedra said the key takeaway is that social networks are not fixed. With the right opportunities and supports older adults can build stronger, more enriching relationships despite these types of disadvantages.

“That was the silver lining,” Piedra said.

“We saw movement into more robust networks across all groups. That gives us reason to be hopeful. We know that these social networks are particularly important as we age and that loneliness has huge implications for cognitive and physical health. The quality of our final years becomes very problematic without an enriched social life,” Piedra said.

“It behooves us to understand who is vulnerable and think about creating tailored public health interventions so that everyone can age well.”

“Social network types and self-rated health among diverse older adults: Stability, transitions and implications for health equity” by Lissette Piedra et al. Innovation in Aging

Abstract

Social network types and self-rated health among diverse older adults: Stability, transitions and implications for health equity

Background and objectives

This study explores how social networks among older adults evolve over time and their impact on self-rated health (SRH), emphasizing differences across ethnoracial and linguistic groups. Though the link between social networks and well-being is well-known, how these networks change and affect health remains less understood.

Research Design and Methods

The study examined changes in social network types across three rounds of the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project. The initial sample included 3,005 individuals, which decreased to 1,592 by the final follow-up.

We analyzed data from participants in every round, totaling 6,858 observations, using Random-Intercept Latent Transition Analysis. Multinomial logistic regressions were conducted to predict network membership and transitions, and to assess correlations with SRH.

Results

We identified three distinct social network types: ‘Enriched,’ ‘Focused,’ and ‘Restricted.’ ‘Enriched’ networks feature broad connections, high marriage rates, active engagement, and low loneliness. ‘Focused’ networks involve small, close-knit groups with frequent interactions, moderate marriage rates, and low loneliness. ‘Restricted’ networks are family-oriented, with low marriage rates and the highest loneliness levels.

Over time, ‘Restricted’ networks became more prevalent, while ‘Focus’ networks showed the most mobility.

Network type membership varied significantly by ethnoracial identity and gender, with Black, Hispanic, and female respondents less likely to belong to ‘Enriched’ networks. Membership in ‘Enriched’ networks was linked to better SRH scores.

Discussion and Implications

The growth of ‘Restricted’ networks over time raises concerns about older adults becoming confined to limited social environments. However, there is a silver lining: within the ‘Focused’ group, more individuals transition to ‘Enriched’ networks than to ‘Restricted’ ones, indicating that older adults can expand their social connections as they age.

Understanding the factors driving this shift can guide interventions to promote network expansion for vulnerable groups, enhancing social well-being, and mitigating the risks associated with restricted networks.","“Social network types and self-rated health among diverse older adults: Stability, transitions and implications for health equity” by Lissette Piedra et al.

That does not mean that golf courses are directly causing Parkinson's, but the authors of the study, led by Brittany Krzyzanowski of the Barrow Neurological Institute in the US, have a hypothesis. They think that rampant pesticides on fairways and greens may be exposing nearby residents to toxic chemicals via the air and water.

That's a scary prospect, to be sure, but independent experts at the non-profit Parkinson's UK, who were not involved in the current research, have called these suspicions ""reductive"".

frameborder=""0″ allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"" referrerpolicy=""strict-origin-when-cross-origin"" allowfullscreen>

Parkinson's disease is a complex neurological condition without known cause, and in recent years, intense debate has raged over whether certain pesticides may increase the risk of neurodegeneration.

Farmers, for instance, tend to face higher risks of Parkinson's, as do those who live in historically industrial regions. Studies in the lab suggest some pesticides and air pollutants can be toxic to brain cells.

But while human-made chemicals may be a factor in Parkinson's disease, so could genetics. The evidence at this point is not clear-cut.

""Many studies have investigated whether pesticides increase the risk of developing Parkinson's in different populations around the world,"" says Katherine Fletcher, lead researcher at Parkinson's UK.

""The results have been varied, but overall suggest that exposure to pesticides may increase the risk of the condition. However, the evidence is not strong enough to show that pesticide exposure directly causes Parkinson's.""

The newest research from Krzyzanowski and colleagues at the Mayo Clinic, the University of Rochester, and the University of Kansas adds to the debate.

Their population-based study compared 419 Parkinson's cases with 5,113 healthy individuals, matched for sex, age, and demographics.

After adjusting for various neighborhood characteristics, the team found that living within a mile (1.6 kilometers) of a golf course was associated with a 126 percent increased risk of developing Parkinson's, compared to those living more than 6 miles (nearly 10 kilometers) away.

What's more, people living within water service areas containing a golf course were found to have nearly double the odds of developing Parkinson's compared to those living in golf-free areas.

These correlations have led Krzyzanowski and colleagues to argue that golf courses are a possible risk factor for Parkinson's disease, and that pesticides in the air and in the groundwater may contribute to that risk.

""Public health policies to reduce the risk of groundwater contamination and airborne exposure from pesticides on golf courses may help reduce risk of Parkinson's disease in nearby neighborhoods,"" argue Krzyzanowski and her team.

But Fletcher and her colleague, David Dexter, at Parkinson's UK are unconvinced. The new study never tested for groundwater contamination near golf courses, or pollutants in the air, nor did the researchers properly control for other sources of urban air pollution, like that kicked up by road traffic.

What's more, groundwater data on pesticides around golf courses is limited, and a 2024 study found that airborne pesticides are of ""limited concern"" to golfers, even after playing an 18-hole course purposefully sprayed with chemicals.

""Parkinson's starts in the brain 10 to 15 years before diagnosis, and the study didn't only use subjects who permanently lived in the area,"" adds Dexter in an independent comment.

""This would not only affect participants' exposure, but also suggests their Parkinson's could have started before they moved around a golf course.""

The current research elevates recent concerns around pesticides, but it is hardly a hole-in-one. Researchers will need to take quite a few more swings to prove that pesticides from golf courses are leaching into groundwater and raising the risk of Parkinson's for those living nearby.

The study was published in JAMA Network Open.","A contentious new study has found that people who live near golf courses may face a higher risk of Parkinson's disease.

The capsules produce a temporary coating in the gut that prevents food from being absorbed, forcing it into the lower intestine and triggering hormones that make you feel full.

Its manufacturers say it may have advantages over weight-loss injections such as Ozempic and Mounjaro, including having fewer side effects and being easier to take.

It is also far safer and less invasive than actual gastric bypass surgery.

Rahul Dhanda, chief executive of Syntis Bio, makers of the pill, said: ‘The problem is [fat jabs] are not very tolerable and patients want to come off them.

‘You want to have a long-term maintenance therapy, and an oral pill is the rational choice because it’s simple, tolerable and safe.

The capsules produce a temporary coating in the gut that prevents food from being absorbed, forcing it into the lower intestine and triggering hormones that make you feel full

‘What we’re seeing now is patients and clinics being more focused on having something safe and sustainable to keep on a manageable, sustainable weight-loss path.

‘I anticipate the side effects to be minimal to none, and we haven’t seen any yet in human tests. That is because it doesn’t enter the bloodstream like injections do.

‘It’s a mechanical molecule, so it’s like we’re inserting a stent, as opposed to a drug that is acting with the target, and also off the target.’

By binding to the mucous membrane lining of the duodenum - the top of the intestine near the stomach - the pills create a barrier that stops calories being absorbed.

It forces food directly into the lower part of the digestive system, the pills set off a ‘cascade’ of hormones including GLP-1, the same chemical mimicked by semaglutide jab Wegovy.

It also causes the body to stop producing ghrelin, which makes you feel hungry, and start producing leptin, which makes you feel satisfied.

Manufacturers say it may have advantages over weight-loss injections such as Ozempic and Mounjaro, including having fewer side effects and being easier to take

The person taking the pill feels full more quickly and stops eating.

The coating created by the pill sheds naturally after about 24 hours, leaving no trace.

The effect is similar to gastric bypass, in which surgeons make the stomach smaller and shorten the small intestine, changing how the body absorbs food and leaving people feeling fuller after eating less.

In rats, the drug caused the animals to lose 1 per cent of their bodyweight per week while preserving 100 per cent of their lean muscle mass.

Trials in humans have not studied weight loss but found the pills cause no harmful side effects.

If they prove effective in further trials, the pills could help patients maintain a healthy weight after intensive weight-loss with jabs, or replace the injections entirely.

Dr Louis Aronne of Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City told the conference that a 'golden age' of treatment had begun with these new drugs.

The Times reported he was pushing for health providers, including the NHS, to 'roll them out at scale', addding: 'I think use of drugs like this will prevent the need for many other medications, procedures, and surgeries.

Frozen pizzas are notoriously high in sodium, calories and saturated fat. They also tend to be lacking in the vegetable department. While an occasional pizza night isn't going to make or break your health, if pizza is a part of your weekly meal rotation it's worth being mindful of which ones you choose — after all, it's estimated that pizza makes up 27% of your total energy intake on the day that it's eaten.

Anna Smith, a registered dietitian for Lose It and owner of Anna Smith Nutrition in Nashville, notes that even if frozen pizza isn't ""exactly a health food, if it's what gets your family sitting down to share a meal, that's a win in my book. There's a ton of research linking shared meals with positive outcomes for kids and adults alike."" But what if you could enjoy a shared meal without compromising your health goals? Luckily, there are many better-for-you frozen options — the key is figuring out which ones are actually worth the money.

Best overall healthy frozen pizza

Alexandra Ginos Best overall healthy frozen pizza Banza Margherita Pizza Serving size: ½ pizza | Calories per serving: 400 | Protein per serving: 16 g | Fiber per serving: 10 g | Sodium per serving: 730 mg | Standout nutritional features: Vegetarian, certified gluten-free Banza became a household name thanks to its chickpea-based mac and cheese, but I'd argue that its frozen pizza is equally worthy of recognition. Banza Margherita Pizza is vegetarian-friendly, certified gluten-free and totally crave-worthy thanks to its crunchy crust and flavorful toppings. The ingredient list has nothing to hide, with easy-to-read ingredients, including real cheese, San Marzano tomato sauce, basil and oregano. Nutritionally, this pizza is a home run thanks to its chickpea flour-based crust. In fact, each serving — which is half of the pizza — offers 16 grams of protein and 10 grams of fiber, making it a much more filling option than your standard frozen Margherita pizza. Plus, unlike many cauliflower crust-based pies, Banza's pizza has a crisp yet slightly soft texture that more closely resembles a traditional flour crust. According to one Amazon reviewer, ""Banza Margherita Frozen Pizza is hands down the best gluten-free pizza I've ever had!"" They add, ""The crust is perfectly crisp, and the Margherita toppings are fresh and flavorful. With more protein and fiber than traditional pizza, Banza is my go-to option for a nutritious meal that doesn't compromise on taste. It's perfect for anyone looking for a healthier pizza alternative."" While the Margherita was our fave, this chickpea pizza is also available in other flavors, including vegan varieties like Vegan Roasted Veggie. The biggest downside is the price, as one pizza serves only two people. Some customers also complain about the lack of topping options, though this can easily be remedied by adding your own roasted veggies, lean proteins or sliced olives on top. Pros High in fiber

Despite its smaller size, each serving — which is the whole pizza — boasts 33 grams of protein and 17 grams of fiber. It's also low in carbs, with only 25 grams per pie. Considering that the pizza contains just 370 calories, it's also a good option if you're trying to lose weight. Thanks to the cheese topping, it's high in calcium, with 530 mg per portion, and a good source of vitamin A. Best of all, this pizza is quick to make, as it can be heated in the air fryer or microwave. I opted to try it in the microwave and liked it more than I thought I would. While the texture was a bit softer than an oven-baked pizza, the flavor more than made up for it thanks to the gooey cheese and savory chicken. Online reviewers are overall impressed by Vital Pursuit Chicken Mozzarella Pizza's nutrition stats, though it gets mixed reviews on taste, with some finding it too spicy, while others find the flavor to be lacking. As with others on our list, this pizza is high in saturated fat and sodium, which may be a downside for some. Pros High in protein and fiber

Can be prepared in the microwave or air fryer

Portion-controlled

Only 8 grams of net carbs

Delicious savory taste

Alexandra Ginos Best plant-based 'meat' frozen pizza Blackbird Pepperoni Pizza Serving size: ⅓ pizza | Calories per serving: 290 | Protein per serving: 9 g | Fiber per serving: 2 g | Sodium per serving: 550 mg | Standout nutritional features: Vegan-friendly, non-GMO Craving pepperoni pizza but following a plant-based diet? Try Blackbird Pepperoni Pizza. This vegan-friendly pizza features Beyond Meat Beyond Pepperoni and plant-based cheese for a meat- and dairy-free slice that's still every bit as gooey and savory as its non-vegan counterparts. The thick, chewy crust is another standout, as are the slices of fresh garlic on top. Blackbird Pepperoni Pizza is made by hand in a tree-nut and peanut-free New York City-based facility and has rave reviews from vegans and non-vegans alike. According to one reviewer, ""This pizza has a fluffy, airy crust, with a crisp bottom and the sauce is tangy and delicious. It's a simple Margherita, but the flavor goes a long way. Vegan or not, this pizza is great!"" The biggest caveat is the high saturated fat content, with 50% of the recommended daily amount. While it's not a deal-breaker, if you eat this pizza regularly you'll just want to keep an eye on your saturated fat intake at other meals and snacks. Pros Vegan-friendly

9 grams of protein per serving

Delicious chewy crust

Dietitian-approved tips for including pizza in a healthy diet

If you're trying to eat healthier, pizza doesn't have to be off the table. In fact, depending on the recipe or product, it can be a nutritious addition to your weekly meal rotation. The key is being mindful of portion sizes and slowing down to enjoy each bite. ""Eating slowly helps you tune in to your body and stop when you're full, not stuffed,"" recommends Smith. Diane Han, a weight management dietitian in San Francisco, agrees, noting that honoring your fullness cues allows you to enjoy pizza night without feeling sick or uncomfortable.

Also keep in mind that frozen pizza, even if it has veggies, typically isn't a balanced meal all on its own. Pairing pizza with a salad, a bowl of roasted vegetables and/or lean protein, like grilled chicken, can help round out the meal and ensure you're getting adequate amounts of important nutrients, like protein, fiber and healthy fats.

Han also recommends adding these nutrient boosters directly to your pizza, either before or after baking. ""Top your pizza with salad greens or roasted veggies so you won't even need utensils!"" she says. Brownstein offers a similar recommendation, saying you can ""zhuzh up frozen pizza by topping it with extra vegetables or leftover proteins."" For a quick and easy dinner, she recommends placing a pan of fresh or frozen vegetables in the oven at the same time as your pizza.

Factors to consider when shopping for frozen pizza

With many frozen pizzas being marketed as a healthier option, how do you know which ones deserve a spot in your shopping cart? Here are some key factors to keep in mind:

Serving size

Check the pizza box to see how much of the pizza counts as a serving. Pizzas vary in diameter and thickness, and suggested serving sizes range from one-fifth of a pizza to a whole pizza. Serving sizes can be deceptive, and if you're hungry, a pizza with a small serving size might not be satisfying enough.

Nutrition stats

The amount of calories, saturated fat, protein and fiber you should aim for per serving depends on your health goals and what you're eating the rest of the day. That said, as a general guideline, aim for pizzas with at least 3 grams of fiber and 12 grams of protein and less than 10% of the daily value for saturated fat. Sheth also suggests looking for options with around 300 to 400 calories per serving, though some people may need a higher-calorie option.

Sodium content

When it comes to frozen foods, it's hard to avoid sodium completely. Not only is sodium found in the cheese and crust of frozen pizza, but this salty nutrient also helps extend the shelf life. That said, some frozen pizzas are higher in sodium than others. Smith recommends choosing a pizza with less than 650 mg of sodium per serving. She also notes that it's not always possible to find a pizza that's high in protein and fiber yet low in sodium. Instead, she recommends simply choosing a pizza that comes closest to hitting these targets.

Toppings

Frozen pizzas are available with a wide range of toppings, from cheese- and meat-loaded pies to roasted veggies and vegan cheese alternatives. When looking for the healthiest frozen pizza, Brownstein recommends choosing a pizza that has some vegetables on it, ""whether it's mushrooms, olives, broccoli, spinach or something else. The vegetables add some extra vitamins, minerals and fiber to help create a balanced meal."" If you enjoy meat on your pizza, Sheth recommends choosing an uncured version without added nitrates/nitrites due to health concerns. Plant-based ""meats"" can also be a good alternative, though these products can be high in sodium.

Crust

Standard frozen pizzas feature crusts made with white wheat flour. While delicious, white flour crusts are typically low in fiber or other essential nutrients thanks to processing and refining. They also aren't suitable for folks with gluten allergies or sensitivities. For added fiber and protein, Han recommends opting for a crust made from chickpeas (for extra protein) or cauliflower. ""These crust options also offer more fiber and are lower in carbohydrates, making them a delicious option for those looking to manage blood sugar levels,"" she notes. Plus, cauliflower and chickpea crusts are typically gluten-free, though you'll want to double-check the label to be safe.

Caulipower Trufflicious Mushroom : The mushroom, truffle oil and white sauce made for a decadent and delicious taste. It's also vegetarian and free from gluten, wheat, peanuts and tree nuts, making it a suitable option for various dietary needs. However, the texture of the cauliflower crust wasn't my favorite — it was very thin and broke apart easily — and the pizza is lower in fiber and protein than many other cauliflower-based options.

Quest Uncured Pepperoni Pizza : This pepperoni pizza offers an impressive 28 grams of protein per serving and is low in carbs, making it a potentially good option for those following a low-carb diet. That said, I wasn't a huge fan of the crust. The pizza is also very high in saturated fat and sodium, with one serving providing 40% of the daily value for both nutrients.

California Pizza Kitchen Uncured Pepperoni Mushroom & Sausage : This cauliflower crust pizza is gluten-free and has 12 grams of protein and 1 gram of fiber per serving. The mozzarella cheese and other toppings tasted great, but the crust was too thin and crackerlike to be my favorite option in the cauliflower crust category. I also didn't find it filling enough to justify the amount of calories and saturated fat.

Daiya Supreme Pizza : As with all Daiya pizzas, the Supreme is vegan-friendly and gluten-free. I liked that it was generously topped with vegetables and plant-based ""sausage"" crumbles. I ultimately liked Blackbird's vegan ""meat"" pizza better, but this one is a good alternative if you can't find Blackbird or prefer a meatless sausage option instead.

Good & Gather Collabs Tavern Style Uncured Pepperoni & Jalapeño: This pizza packs a flavorful punch from the jalapeños and hot honey, plus has 15 grams of protein and 2 grams of fiber per serving. It's also made with uncured pepperoni and without artificial flavors or preservatives. However, it's quite high in saturated fat and sodium, and the crust didn't seem to bake as evenly as others we tried.

FAQs

Can I eat healthier frozen pizzas if I'm trying to lose weight?

Yes, frozen pizza can absolutely fit into a healthy diet for weight loss. Aim for pizzas that are high in fiber and protein and contain 300 to 400 calories per serving. To round out the meal, pair your pizza with a lower-calorie veggie-packed side, like a salad or a bowl of steamed mixed vegetables.

Should I eat frozen pizza regularly?

Everyone has different diet goals. While some frozen pizzas are healthier than others, these foods are still more highly processed and should be enjoyed in moderation. Instead, enjoy frozen pizza as part of an overall healthy diet, including plenty of home-cooked meals and minimally processed foods, like lean proteins, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds.

Is frozen pizza highly processed?

Most frozen pizzas are highly processed. To choose a less processed option, look for a frozen pizza with a relatively short ingredient list that's free of artificial additives and contains more recognizable ingredients, such as tomatoes, roasted vegetables and herbs like basil or oregano.

At a Glance By analyzing subtle facial movements, researchers found ways to objectively measure the severity of tinnitus and sound sensitivity disorder symptoms.

Better measures of symptom severity could aid in evaluating potential treatments.

Mass Eye and Ear

About 12% of adults experience chronic tinnitus, a persistent ringing, buzzing or clicking sound in the ears. This is often accompanied by heightened sensitivity to sounds, called hyperacusis, in which sounds that don’t bother most people become uncomfortable. There are currently no ways to measure these symptoms objectively. Instead, doctors must rely on subjective questionnaires to gauge disease severity.

A research team led by Dr. Daniel Polley at Massachusetts Eye and Ear examined whether certain sounds could elicit unconscious or involuntary responses. These responses, they reasoned, might predict the severity of tinnitus and hyperacusis. They compared 47 people with chronic tinnitus or sound sensitivity to 50 people without either condition. Results of the study, which was funded in part by NIH, appeared in Science Translational Medicine on April 30, 2025.

The team first recorded electrical activity in the participants’ brains. This allowed them to measure how neural activity increases with sound intensity, which is called central auditory neural gain. Excess central auditory gain has been proposed as a possible cause of tinnitus and hyperacusis. They found that people with disordered hearing had higher central auditory gain on average than people with normal hearing. But central gain didn’t correlate with symptom severity as measured by standard questionnaires.

Emotional stimuli can elicit unconscious physiological responses. For example, pupil dilation can be one sign of increased arousal. The researchers recorded participants’ faces while they listened to various emotionally evocative sounds, such as music or unpleasant animal noises. Pupil diameter increased sharply about a half-second after sound onset. The less pleasant the sound, the greater the dilation. In participants with disordered hearing, pupils dilated more for all sounds than in those with normal hearing. Also, pupil dilation was correlated with how severe people reported their tinnitus and hyperacusis to be.

In addition, the team was able to identify subtle involuntary facial movements that occurred in response to the sounds. Pleasant sounds elicited movements around the corners of the mouth. Unpleasant sounds triggered tightening of the muscles around the eyes and forehead. These facial movements tended to be less pronounced in participants with disordered hearing.

Pupil dilation and facial movements accurately reflected questionnaire scores for tinnitus severity. They also tracked with hyperacusis severity scores, although not as accurately as with tinnitus severity.

The results suggest that disrupted sound processing in people with tinnitus and hyperacusis causes unconscious physiological responses. With further development, this system might be used in health clinics and clinical trials to objectively measure the severity of these conditions. Better measures of symptom severity would improve our ability to assess potential treatments for these conditions.

“What’s really exciting is this vantage point into tinnitus severity didn’t require highly specialized brain scanners; instead, the approach was relatively low-tech,” Polley says.

Jackie and her three daughters have a family history of breast cancer

More than 1,200 patients a year in the UK could benefit from the change in practice if a larger clinical trial can confirm the findings.

Giving them the targeted drug olaparib before surgery greatly reduced the chances of the cancer coming back.

The trial, led by Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, and published in Nature Communications, involved women with early-stage breast cancer who have inherited BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutations.

A new treatment approach can significantly improve survival rates for patients with aggressive, inherited breast cancer, a study suggests.

The Hollywood star Angelina Jolie raised awareness of inherited breast cancer genes in 2013 when she had a double mastectomy to cut her risk of getting the disease.

'I'm cancer free'

Jackie Van Bochoven, 59, from Cambridgeshire, has a family history of breast cancer and carries a faulty copy of the BRCA1 gene, which significantly raises her risk of the disease during her lifetime.

She was diagnosed with an aggressive breast tumour in 2019 and took part in the trial.

""When I had the diagnosis I was completely shocked,"" she told BBC News.

""Six years on, I'm well and cancer free. It's amazing.""

Jackie's mother and sister both had breast cancer. She has three daughters and the eldest, Danielle, also carries the inherited BRCA gene mutation.

""For my future generations, if they have got the BRCA gene, it is a new hope,"" Jackie said.

Around one in 400 people carry mutations in either the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes.

Cancer Research UK estimates about seven in 10 women with changes in these genes will develop breast cancer, compared to about one in seven women without these mutations.

For men with BRCA mutations, the risks of developing breast cancer are much lower.

Olaparib is the first targeted drug treatment for cancers with mutations in the BRCA genes and is given as a tablet. It works by stopping cancer cells from being able to repair their DNA by blocking a protein called PARP, which causes the cancerous cells to die.

The trial, named Partner, took place at 23 sites in England, Scotland and Wales. Before surgery, 39 women with early stage breast cancer were given olaparib, also known as Lynparza, together with chemotherapy.

They started olaparib tablets 48 hours after each chemotherapy infusion. After three years, all had survived.

By contrast there were six deaths among 45 women in the study who received chemotherapy before surgery but did not get olaparib.

Prof, Jean Abraham, a consultant at Addenbrooke's and professor of precision breast cancer medicine at the University of Cambridge, who led the trial, described the results as were ""really exciting"".

""It is rare that you see 100% survival at 36 months for this subtype of breast cancer. We're incredibly excited about the potential of this new approach.""

The findings have the potential to be applied to other BRCA-related cancers, such as ovarian, prostate and pancreatic.""","A new treatment approach can significantly improve survival rates for patients with aggressive, inherited breast cancer, a study suggests.

Long working hours might not just be bad for you, they could also be altering the structure of your brain, a new study suggests.

The research, published Tuesday, found “significant changes” in the brains of people who were overworking, which is a combination of physical and emotional overexertion, as well as a lack of rest.

The research was conducted by two scientists at South Korea’s Chung-Ang University and Yonsei University, who followed 110 healthcare workers classified into “overworked” and “non-overworked” groups.

In South Korea, where 52 hours of work per week is the legal upper limit, overworking has become a public health concern.

The overworked group, clocking 52 hours or more each week, consisted of 32 people who were on average younger, in employment for less time and more highly educated in comparison to those working standard hours.

By comparing data from a different study and MRI scans, the researchers were able to use a neuroimaging technique to analyse the workers’ brain volume.

The technique allowed them to identify and compare differences in levels of gray matter in different regions of the brain, while the application of atlas-based analysis meant they could identify and label structures in brain scans.

“People who worked 52 or more hours a week displayed significant changes in brain regions associated with executive function and emotional regulation, unlike participants who worked standard hours,” researchers said in a press release.

Areas of the brain that showed an increase in volume include the middle frontal gyrus, which plays a major role in cognitive functions, attention, memory and language-related processes, as well as the insula, which is involved in emotional processing, self-awareness and understanding social context.

Researchers believe their findings suggest a “potential relationship” between having an increased workload and changes in these parts of the brain, providing a biological basis for the cognitive and emotional challenges reported by people who are overworked.

Joon Yul Choi, coauthor of the study and an assistant professor at Yonsei University’s Department of Biomedical Engineering, told CNN that these changes might be “at least in part, reversible” if environmental stressors are reversed. Still, returning to your brain’s baseline state could take much longer.

‘Important new evidence’

Previous research has also found evidence of the negative health impacts of long working hours. In 2021, joint research from the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that overworking led to more than 745,000 deaths in a year. Long hours have also been found to raise the risk of diabetes in women and contribute to a decline in cognitive ability.

While these behavioral and psychological consequences of overwork are well-known, the underlying neurological mechanisms and changes in anatomy are less understood, the study explained.

Frank Pega, who led the WHO-ILO 2021 study, told CNN that these latest findings constitute “important new evidence” that could help better understand how long working hours “radically” impact the physical health of workers.

Pega, a WHO technical officer who was not involved in this latest study, said the research supports WHO-ILO’s findings that “long working hours contribute the largest burden of disease of all occupational risk factors identified so far.”

However, the study’s small sample size and focus only on healthcare workers in South Korea makes it hard to generalize its results. “More studies in different populations are needed,” said Pega.

“While the results should be interpreted cautiously due to the exploratory nature of this pilot study, they represent a meaningful first step in understanding the relationship between overwork and brain health,” said the researchers.

As for anyone stuck working long hours? Now you might have a scientific basis to cut down on your time at work.

“Governments, employers, and workers can all take actions to protect workers’ health from long working hours,” advised Pega, citing laws, regulations and policies that can ensure healthy work hours.

“The results underscore the importance of addressing overwork as an occupational health concern,” said the study’s authors.

Jonny Gifford, principal research fellow at the Institute for Employment Studies in Brighton, England, who was not involved in the study, told CNN that the research “confirms some physiological reasons that working long hours affects our wellbeing.”

“The use of brain scanning equipment to give neurological explanations gives powerful new evidence linking overwork with structural changes in parts of the brain involved in executive function and emotional regulation,” he said.

“It’s a small study of 110 healthcare workers in Korea, but because it is based on robust neurological measures and concerns fundamental mechanisms (overwork and fatigue) that can affect anyone, the central findings are widely relevant,” Gifford added.

The study was published in the journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine.","CNN —Long working hours might not just be bad for you, they could also be altering the structure of your brain, a new study suggests.

The adverse effects on quality of life appear to be amplified by dysfunctional efforts to manage the intense emotional dysregulation associated with ADHD under the influence of alcohol. The research was published in the Journal of Psychiatric Research.

Alcohol use disorder is a chronic condition marked by an inability to control alcohol consumption despite harmful consequences, resulting in significant distress or impairment. It involves a pattern of excessive drinking, strong cravings, and a loss of control over alcohol intake. Individuals with this disorder often experience withdrawal symptoms such as tremors, anxiety, and nausea when not drinking.

The severity of alcohol use disorder can range from mild to severe, depending on the number of symptoms present. Over time, it can lead to serious health problems, including liver disease, cardiovascular complications, and cognitive decline. Social and occupational functioning often deteriorates as individuals begin to neglect responsibilities and relationships due to their drinking.

Study author Amandine Luquiens and her colleagues aimed to examine how alcohol use affects quality of life in individuals with ADHD. In particular, they focused on the roles of impulsivity, emotional dysregulation, and maladaptive emotion regulation strategies in this relationship.

ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by persistent patterns of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that interfere with daily life. It typically begins in childhood but can continue into adulthood, affecting academic, occupational, and social functioning.

The researchers analyzed data from the beginning of the TRAIN study, a clinical trial in France investigating the efficacy of a cognitive training program for patients with alcohol use disorder. The sample included 206 individuals diagnosed with alcohol use disorder, 40 of whom also had ADHD. All participants were classified as being at high risk due to their drinking levels—defined as consuming over 60 grams of alcohol per day for men and over 40 grams per day for women during the previous four-week period. At the time of the study, participants had been abstinent for between 7 and 30 days.

Participants completed a series of assessments measuring ADHD symptoms (using the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale), health-related quality of life specific to alcohol use disorder (using the Alcohol Quality of Life Scale), impulsivity (using the Impulsive Behavior Scale), emotion regulation strategies (using the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire), emotion regulation difficulties (using the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale – Impulse Control Difficulties subscale), and alcohol-related cognitive impairment (using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment).

The results showed that alcohol use had a greater negative impact on quality of life in individuals with ADHD compared to those without the disorder. Participants who were highly impulsive or who had difficulties with emotional regulation tended to report lower quality of life as well. Individuals with ADHD were more likely to suppress emotional expression, which was associated with further declines in quality of life. Overall, the researchers concluded that dysfunctional efforts to cope with emotional dysregulation significantly contributed to reduced well-being in individuals with ADHD and alcohol use disorder.

“Our findings have direct clinical and therapeutic implications. They underscore the relevance of identifying patients’ preferred emotion regulation strategies and the need to work with them on the limits of expressive suppression in the context of ADHD in AUD [alcohol use disorder], and on more functional and less costly alternatives,” the study authors note.

The study sheds light on the specificities of the relationship between alcohol use and quality of life in individuals with alcohol use disorder who also suffer from ADHD. However, it should be noted that the design of the study does not allow any causal inferences to be derived from the results.

A phenomenon largely ignored since its discovery 100 years ago appears to be a crucial component of diabetic pain, according to new research from The University of Texas at Dallas’ Center for Advanced Pain Studies (CAPS).

Findings from a new study, published in Nature Communications on May 5, suggest that cell clusters called Nageotte nodules are a strong indicator of nerve cell death in human sensory ganglia.

These could prove to be a target for drugs that would protect these nerves or help manage diabetic neuropathy.

“The key finding of our study is really a new view of diabetic neuropathic pain,” said Dr. Ted Price BS’97, Ashbel Smith Professor of neuroscience in the School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences, CAPS director and co-corresponding author of the study.

“We believe our data demonstrate that neurodegeneration in the dorsal root ganglion is a critical facet of the disease — which should really force us to think about the disease in a new and urgent way.”

Diabetic neuropathy is one of the most common forms of neuropathic pain and affects about 11 million people — nearly one-third of the 38 million diabetics in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It typically affects the extremities, causing sharp, shooting pain.

“Diabetic neuropathy can be debilitating,” said neuroscience research scientist Stephanie Shiers PhD’19, a co-corresponding author.

“Treatment options are not great, and if the underlying diabetes is not managed, people may require amputation due to damage to the peripheral nerves to the point of loss of sensation.”

With support from a Research Program Cooperative Agreement grant (U19) from the National Institutes of Health, Shiers and other scientists at CAPS are mapping human dorsal root ganglia and other sensory system tissue to understand human pain mechanisms.

“I found an abundance of these Nageotte nodules in a subset of the dorsal root ganglia recovered from organ donors. When I looked up the medical history on these samples, they were all from individuals with diabetes,” she said.

“These nodules were more prevalent in people with diabetes and even more so in those with diabetic neuropathy. Organ donors die from a range of conditions, so discovering these abnormalities in a large subset of the tissue with a similar medical history was a big break.”

Nageotte nodules are dead sensory neurons that have decayed, and what remains is a cluster of non-neuronal cells. They were first documented in 1922 in rabbits by the French neuroanatomist Jean Nageotte.

In the past 100 years, these nodules have been almost entirely ignored in the research literature, only appearing in about 20 papers, many of which are a half-century old.

“They appear to be a sign of degeneration where hyperglycemia reduces neuron viability,” Shiers said.

“Little has been documented about these structures’ molecular composition. Virtually nobody in the pain field had heard of them, and we knew almost nothing about their involvement in pain and neurodegeneration.”

In this study, Shiers and her colleagues sought to characterize Nageotte nodules at the molecular level.

Using histology and spatial sequencing, they demonstrated that Nageotte nodules are abundant in sensory ganglia of those with diabetic neuropathy. They are mainly composed of satellite glia and non-myelinating Schwann cells.

“Intertwined with the nodule is a bundle of axons: fibers of sensory neurons that look like little neuromas. The axons there appear to sprout from sensory neurons; they are pain-sensing fibers,” Shiers said.

“This appears to be a unique pathology — something never described before in humans.”

If that’s the case, the discovery could be an indicator of how to create treatment options.

“Spontaneous activity in these fibers may be what’s behind diabetic neuropathy,” Shiers said. “We also had several donors with other types of neuropathic conditions that weren’t diabetes-related, and their DRGs also had an abundance of Nageotte nodules.”

While the rare earlier papers mentioning Nageotte nodules are mostly case studies of single individuals, this study had samples from 90 people. Shiers said her documentation of axons sprouting in this manner is also novel — another aspect of this study that represents new territory.

“This could change our basic understanding of sensory neurons. Sensory neurons are not supposed to sprout fibers from their cell bodies; they have a unique shape that we call pseudounipolar, but these diabetic sensory neurons do not look pseudounipolar — they look multipolar.” Shiers said.

“We don’t know if this morphology is pathological or if we have lacked understanding of these cells in humans.”

Researchers can study human dorsal root ganglia from such a large selection of patients due to the work of the Southwest Transplant Alliance, a nonprofit organization that recovers donated organs and tissues for transplantation.

“The ability to give life to others through research is incredibly important to our donation community,” Southwest Transplant Alliance President and CEO Brad Adams said. “Knowing that your loved one’s gift led to incredible medical discoveries and advances such as this brings hope and healing to all who have lost a loved one.”

Price said, “The entire study would never have happened without them. This partnership is the most important thing that enables this work.”

Price said the research has led to new ways of thinking about neuropathy.

“In my view, one of the most important insights we gained from this work is thinking about treating diabetic neuropathic pain differently. I think what we need to focus on now is neuroprotection at early stages of disease so that these Nageotte nodules do not form in the first place.”

“Nageotte nodules in human dorsal root ganglia reveal neurodegeneration in diabetic peripheral neuropathy” by Ted Price et al. Nature Communications

Abstract

Nageotte nodules in human dorsal root ganglia reveal neurodegeneration in diabetic peripheral neuropathy

Nageotte nodules, first described in 1922 by Jean Nageotte, are clusters of non-neuronal cells that form after sensory neuron death.

Despite their historical recognition, little is known about their molecular identity nor their involvement in neuropathies that involve neuronal loss like diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN).

In this study, we molecularly characterize Nageotte nodules in dorsal root ganglia recovered from organ donors with DPN.

Here we show that Nageotte nodules are abundant in DPN sensory ganglia and account for 25% of all neurons.

Peripherin-and Nav1.7-positive dystrophic axons invade Nageotte nodules, forming small neuroma-like structures.

Using histology and spatial sequencing, we demonstrate that Nageotte nodules are mainly composed of satellite glia and non-myelinating Schwann cells that express SPP1 and are intertwined with sprouting sensory axons originating from neighboring neurons.

Our findings suggest that Nageotte nodules are an integral feature of dorsal root ganglion neurodegeneration, providing potential therapeutic targets for sensory neuron protection and pain management in DPN.","This discovery could shift how diabetic nerve pain is treated, moving the focus toward early neuroprotection before these nodules form.

You’ve heard it for years: Age is just a number. But there’s been a huge focus lately on biological age, which is how old your cells are. There are a bunch of different ways to calculate this number, including tests you can order online. But researchers have just discovered a new way of calculating your biological age—and they say it’s the most accurate one you’ll find. It’s called the Health Octo Tool, and it uses a slew of different metrics to figure out your biological age.

Meet the experts: David Cutler, M.D., a family medicine physician at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA; Parul Goyal, M.D., a geriatrician at Vanderbilt Health in Nashville; Shabnam Salimi, M.D., Ph.D., physician-scientist and an investigator at the University of Washington Medicine Healthy Aging & Longevity Research Institute

Here’s why there’s so much buzz around it right now, plus why knowing your biological age may help you live longer.

What is the Health Octo Tool?

The Health Octo tool is a new health assessment tool that uses several metrics taken from a physical exam and routine lab tests. When used together, it can help determine a person’s biological age and predict their risk of disability and death, according to a scientific paper published in Nature Communications.

The tool centers around an aging concept called health entropy, which is how much molecular and cellular damage the body accumulates over time, as well as how that damage impacts organs and bodily systems.

To create the tool, the researchers analyzed data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging, analyzing participants’ medical history as well as data from physical exams and other medical tests. The researchers also included data from two other large studies on more than 45,000 adults.

The scientists created what they called a Body Organ Disease Number, which was based on the number of organ systems, like the cardiovascular, respiratory, and central nervous systems, that were impacted by disease. They also factored in whether a person had a history of cancer or stroke to get a score between one and 14.

The researchers also created something called a Speed-Body Clock and Speed-Body Age to break down how a person’s biological age impacts their walking speed (which is a common measure of function in older people). Also in the mix: Disability-Body Clock and Disability Body Age, which analyzes how getting older impacts the risk of developing cognitive and physical disability.

All of those metrics can be gathered from a person's medical history, physical exam, and test results to calculate a person’s aging process.

Ultimately, the researchers say that the Health Octo tool is better than major tests used for assessing biological age, including the frailty index, a widely-used test that looks at a person’s susceptibility to age-related health issues. The researchers found that the test can predict the odds of developing disability and death with 90% or higher accuracy.

What makes this better than other biological tests?

The Health Octo tool uses some of the same data from existing biological tests, but takes things a step further. Many of the tests that are currently used focus on the impact of certain diseases, but don’t consider how those diseases and minor disorders impact a person’s overall health, the researchers explained in the paper.

“Health decline is multi-dimensional,” says lead study author Shabnam Salimi, M.D., Ph.D., physician-scientist and an investigator at the University of Washington Medicine Healthy Aging & Longevity Research Institute. “So, we decided to develop a multi-dimensional health metric that captures intrinsic aging and rate of aging.”

What can knowing your biological age do for your overall health and longevity?

Knowing your biological age has become more of a fun health flex lately, but doctors say it’s important to know this number beyond bragging rights. “There is some value to seeing the things you should be doing,” says David Cutler, M.D., a family medicine physician at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA. Meaning, if you know your diet isn’t as clean as it should be, and your biological age is older than your chronological age (i.e. how many years you’ve been alive), it should be a wake-up call to do things differently.

“Biological aging mechanisms underlie accumulation of chronic diseases,” Dr. Salimi says. “So, translating health to rate of aging can help to better understand biological aging mechanisms and response to interventions that target biological age.”

Parul Goyal, M.D., a geriatrician at Vanderbilt Health in Nashville, agrees. “Knowing your biological age is a good tool so that patients are more aware of what their health looks like,” she says. “They can then make proactive, positive changes in their health to be more physically fit and emotionally engaged.”

While Dr. Cutler points out that “you probably know that you should be doing things differently anyway,” if you’re not on top of your health habits, he notes that a higher biological age may motivate some people to make changes. Of course, that doesn’t mean that it will. “Is that going to make people drink less, avoid smoking, and eat better? We don’t know,” Dr. Cutler says.

What do doctors recommend for healthy aging?

Doctors recommend doing a lot of different things to age in a healthy way, although none are shocking. Here’s the advice Dr. Cutler and Dr. Goyal share with their patients:

Eat a healthy, varied diet—ideally the Mediterranean diet.

Limit alcohol or avoid it entirely.

Don’t smoke or quit smoking.

Try to be active on a daily basis.

Stay on top of routine healthcare, including cancer screenings.

Wear a helmet when you ride a bike.

Use your seatbelt in the car.

Try to minimize stress in your life.

Focus on getting good sleep.

Try to stay mentally stimulated.

Socialize with friends and family.

Dr. Salimi says that she and her fellow researchers are now working on developing an app to make the Health Octo Tool easier to use.

Any disruption, even slight, can rapidly trigger Alzheimer’s-like damage.

For the first time, researchers have shown using living human brain tissue how a toxic variant of a protein associated with Alzheimer’s disease can attach to and damage the connections between brain cells.

The study used small samples of healthy brain tissue obtained during routine neurosurgical procedures. These samples were exposed to amyloid beta, a protein linked to the development of Alzheimer’s.

Unlike the response to the normal form of amyloid beta, the brain tissue did not attempt to repair the damage caused by the toxic version.

The study also found that even small changes in the natural levels of amyloid beta, either increasing or decreasing, were enough to disrupt brain cells. This suggests the brain requires a finely tuned ‘sweet spot’ of the protein to function properly, experts say.

Researchers at the University of Edinburgh hope the discoveries will allow them to hone in on drugs that have the best chance of preventing the loss of synapses – connections which allow the flow of messages between brain cells and are vital to healthy brain function.

Alzheimer’s disease attacks synapses, and their loss strongly predicts reduced memory and thinking abilities.

Keeping Human Brain Tissue Alive in the Lab

Central to the early success of the Dyson RAD Dementia Research Acceleration Project has been the pioneering method that keeps tiny fragments of human brain alive in laboratory dishes for several weeks after collection, with the patient’s permission.

This innovative approach offers a rare and powerful opportunity to investigate the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease in living human brain cells.

Researchers also discovered that brain slices taken from the temporal lobe, a region known to be affected early in Alzheimer’s, released higher levels of another key disease protein, called tau. This may help explain why this part of the brain is particularly vulnerable in the early stages of the condition, as increased tau release may enable faster spread of toxic forms of this protein between cells.

In addition, a number of the samples were found to contain early indicators of Alzheimer’s, such as amyloid plaques and tau tangles, demonstrating the potential of this model to study the disease before symptoms appear.

Accelerating Drug Discovery

Experts say this innovative approach will make it easier to test experimental drugs before they enter clinical trials, increasing the chance of finding drugs that work in the human brain.

The study is published in Nature Communications and was supported by a fellowship from Race Against Dementia (RAD) – a charity formed by Sir Jackie Stewart following his wife’s dementia diagnosis – and a £1 million donation from the James Dyson Foundation – Sir James Dyson’s charity that supports medical research and engineering education. The donation helped employ two scientists, secure time from research nurses, and obtain the cutting-edge laboratory equipment needed for working with living human brain tissue.

The project links experts from Formula One and Dyson with early-career researchers to accelerate progress towards a cure for dementia. It marries best practice from these fast-paced, innovative industries with novel scientific techniques to investigate the biology of human brain tissue.

Dr Claire Durrant, RAD Dyson Fellow and UK Dementia Research Institute Emerging Leader at the Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences at the University of Edinburgh, said: “Working alongside the neurosurgical team at the University of Edinburgh, we have shown that living human brain slices can be used to explore fundamental questions relating to Alzheimer’s disease. We believe this tool could help accelerate findings from the lab into patients, bringing us one step closer to a world free from the heartbreak of dementia.

“These findings are a testament to the incredible support of my funders and the hard work of my team members Dr Robert McGeachan and Dr Soraya Meftah who led on the experiments.”

Voices from the Frontlines of Dementia Research

Sir Jackie Stewart OBE, founder of Race Against Dementia, which has supported Dr Durrant’s laboratory since 2019, said: “It’s a horrendous reality that as things stand, one in three people born today, will die with dementia. Someone develops dementia every three seconds – and we still don’t have a cure. I created Race Against Dementia to challenge this awful disease in the fullest sense. Our collaboration across industries allows us to think keener and faster and the breakthrough that we have achieved shows what is possible when science moves faster, with new tools and fresh thinking. Our unique program is enabling us to test potential treatments which are bringing us closer to a world without dementia. I am sure that for you, like me, that cannot happen soon enough.”

James Dyson, Founder of Dyson, said: “I’ve been delighted to support Dr Durrant’s novel approach. Working with brain surgeons and their consenting patients nationwide to collect samples of living human brain and keep them alive in the lab is a groundbreaking method. It allows researchers to better examine Alzheimer’s disease on real human brain cells rather than relying on animal substitutes, such as mice. Dr Durrant’s findings show that she is progressing towards solving one of the most devastating problems of our time.”

Professor Tara Spires-Jones, Group Leader at the UK Dementia Research Institute at the University of Edinburgh, said: “This important work by Dr Durrant’s team brings a new tool to scientists’ toolbox to better understand Alzheimer’s disease and how to treat it. The use of living human tissue samples generously donated by people undergoing surgery to remove brain tumours allows scientists to probe how living human brain reacts to toxic proteins produced in Alzheimer’s, and in the future will allow testing of whether new treatments are effective in human brain. This cutting-edge study is an example of how the UK Dementia Research Institute is at the forefront of global efforts to understand and treat Alzheimer’s.”

As the weather turns warmer, a lot of us are spending more time outside, which means dog owners are on the lookout for ticks.

While people think of the spring and summer as tick season, a Maryland-based veterinarian said he sees more ticks in the fall months of October, November and December than he does in July and August.

“Ticks come out all year round,” said Dr. Victor Katz, of the Muddy Branch Veterinary Center in Gaithersburg. “If it gets to 32 degrees frost, they might be a little dormant, but as soon as it warms up to 35-37 degrees, they start moving around.”

A dog’s ambient temperature is 101 degrees. Ticks want to be warm and can sense temperature, humidity and movement.

“They basically hatch out and basically attach to the dogs. They just want to be warm,” Katz said.

There are several tick-related diseases prevalent in the D.C. region, including Lyme, ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis.

“They moved the epicenter for studying Lyme disease from Hartford, Connecticut, to Derwood, Maryland, about seven years ago,” Katz said. “We are in ‘Lyme central.’”

Katz pointed to monthly oral preventive medication, such as Simparica, Bravecto and NexGard, as the best way to keep your dogs safe from tick borne diseases.

“It does not put a bubble around the dog where it basically shoots the tick with laser beams or something like that,” he said.

But if a tick bites a dog that’s on an oral preventive, it will die in about four to six hours. Transmission of some of these diseases often takes up to 10 to 12 hours.

“So, it’s basically wiping the tick out before they get a chance to transmit enough of the disease to harm the dog,” he said.

There is data, according to Katz, that shows the preventatives might increase seizure potential in some dogs. He recommended for those dogs, using a Seresto tick collar that lasts about six months and, he said, “works really well.”

In a nutshell Older adults who sat longer each day showed faster brain shrinkage, even if they exercised regularly.

Sitting time was linked to worse memory and cognitive performance, especially in people with the APOE-ε4 gene.

Spending less time sitting may protect your brain as much as adding more exercise.

NASHVILLE — Are you reading this while lounging on your couch? You might want to stand up. New research shows that too much sitting could damage your brain, regardless of your exercise habits.

A study spanning seven years found that older adults who spent more hours sitting experienced faster brain shrinkage and mental decline – even among those who regularly worked out.

This finding challenges what many people believe: that regular exercise makes up for hours of sitting. According to the research, most participants were active enough to meet CDC guidelines for weekly physical activity. Yet their sedentary behavior still harmed their brain health.

The Hidden Cost of Being Sedentary

Researchers from Vanderbilt University’s Memory and Alzheimer’s Center followed 404 older adults (average age 71) for seven years, using wrist-worn activity monitors to accurately track movement patterns. On average, participants sat for about 13 hours daily – a number that might seem high until you add up your own sitting time from commuting, desk work, meals, and evening relaxation.

The brain changes linked to more sitting occurred in regions that are typically vulnerable to Alzheimer’s disease. People who sat more showed thinning in these areas and performed worse on memory tests that asked them to recall past experiences and events.

Over time, those who sat more lost hippocampal volume faster and showed greater declines in their ability to name objects and process information quickly. The hippocampus, which helps form memories, is among the first brain regions affected by Alzheimer’s disease.

Genetic Risk Factors Amplify the Problem

Most concerning was that sitting had worse effects on carriers of the APOE-ε4 gene variant, which increases Alzheimer’s risk. When researchers separated participants by genetic status, they discovered that APOE-ε4 carriers who sat more showed significantly greater reductions in total brain matter, frontal lobe volume, and parietal lobe volume compared to non-carriers with similar sitting habits.

The study, published in Alzheimer’s & Dementia, found that “APOE-ε4 carriers appear to be at increased risk for neurodegeneration associated with greater sedentary behavior, independent of physical activity level.”

While previous studies have connected too much sitting with heart disease, diabetes, and cancer, this research strengthens the evidence that brain health belongs on that list. Researchers believe that prolonged sitting may harm blood vessels in the brain, increase inflammation, and reduce connections between brain cells.

How the Study Worked

The research team used advanced equipment that measured movement 30 times per second. This allowed them to distinguish between sitting still, light activity like casual walking, and more vigorous movement far more accurately than asking people to recall their activity levels.

Each participant completed extensive cognitive testing and underwent detailed brain scans at the beginning of the study and during follow-up visits. Researchers analyzed various brain regions and something they called an “AD-neuroimaging signature” – a measurement of brain thickness in areas typically affected by Alzheimer’s.

What makes this study particularly valuable is that it controlled for physical activity, allowing researchers to isolate the specific effects of sitting. This reveals that even if you follow exercise guidelines religiously, spending most of your remaining hours sitting could still harm your brain.

Protecting Your Brain Health

With smartphones and artificial intelligence making it easier and easier for people to do countless tasks without getting up, it’s no surprise Americans are becoming increasingly sedentary. The average older adult spends over 9 hours sitting daily, according to previous research mentioned in the study. And that was before the pandemic pushed many people toward even less active lifestyles.

For anyone worried about brain health, the message is clear: cutting sitting time matters just as much as increasing exercise. Standing desks, movement breaks throughout the day, and finding ways to add more motion to daily routines could help protect against cognitive decline.

The evidence points to an important conclusion: what you do between workouts matters just as much as the workouts themselves. Your brain health depends not just on making time for exercise, but on minimizing time spent sitting still.","New research shows that too much sitting could damage your brain, regardless of your exercise habits.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.

CNN —

Pressed into a piece of rock is the flattened, 47 million-year-old body of a cicada. Measuring about 1 inch (26.5 millimeters) long with a wingspan of 2.7 inches (68.2 millimeters), its fossilized form is nearly intact, with its veined wings spread wide.

Scientists recently described the insect as a new genus and species, using this fossil and one other that was nearly as well preserved, from the same site. Even though the specimens are female, their location on the cicada family tree suggests that males of this species could sing as modern cicadas do. Found in Germany decades ago, their presence there reveals that singing cicadas dispersed in Europe millions of years earlier than once thought.

The fossils are also the oldest examples of “true” singing cicadas in the family Cicadidae, researchers reported April 29 in the journal Scientific Reports. Most modern cicadas belong to this family, including annual cicadas that appear every summer worldwide, as well as broods of black-bodied and red-eyed periodical cicadas, which emerge from May to June in eastern North America in cycles of 13 or 17 years. Brood XIV, one of the biggest broods, emerges across a dozen US states this year. Cicadas are found on every continent except Antarctica, and there are more than 3,000 species.

The fossil record for insects in general is abundant in just a few dozen locations, and while modern cicada species are numerous today, paleontologists have documented only 44 Cicadidae fossils. The earliest definitive fossil of a singing cicada was discovered in Montana and dates from 59 million to 56 million years ago, said lead study author Dr. Hui Jiang, a paleontologist and researcher with the Bonn Institute of Organismic Biology at the University of Bonn in Germany. Its newly described relative is the earliest singing cicada from Europe, Jiang told CNN in an email.

Because the body structures of the European fossils were so well preserved, scientists were able to assign the ancient insect to a modern tribe of cicadas called Platypleurini, “which is today primarily distributed in tropical and subtropical regions of sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, but is absent from Europe,” Jiang said.

Prior research suggested that this lineage evolved in Africa about 30 million to 25 million years ago and dispersed from there, according to Jiang. “This fossil pushes back the known fossil record of sound-producing cicadas in the tribe Platypleurini by approximately 20 million years, indicating that the diversification of this group occurred much earlier than previously recognized,” the researcher added.

The discovery hints that this group of cicadas evolved more slowly than prior estimates from molecular data proposed, said Dr. Conrad Labandeira, a senior research geologist and curator of fossil arthropods at the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History in Washington, DC.

“This suggests that older fossils of the Platypleurini are yet to be discovered,” said Labandeira, who was not involved in the research. “Such discoveries would assist in providing better calibrations for determining a more realistic evolutionary rate.”

Researchers named the cicada Eoplatypleura messelensis. Its name refers to where the specimens were discovered: the Messel Pit in Germany, a rich fossil site dating to the Eocene epoch (57 million to 36 million years ago). Excavated in the 1980s, the fossils have since been in the collection of the Senckenberg Research Institute and Natural History Museum Frankfurt in Germany, said senior study author Dr. Sonja Wedmann, head of Senckenberg’s paleoentomology department.

A very deep volcanic lake, with a bottom where no oxygen penetrated, once filled the Messel Pit. That environment created ideal conditions for fossilization, and fine-grain sediments from this former lake bed hold a variety of Eocene life, Wedmann told CNN in an email.

“The excellent preservation not only of insects, but of all groups of organisms, is the reason why Messel is an UNESCO world heritage site,” a designation it earned in 1995, Wedmann said.

The more complete of the two cicada fossils “is one of the best preserved insects from the Messel pit fossil site,” Wedmann added. “Senckenberg has a collection of over 20,000 fossil insects from Messel, and among these it stands out because of its really beautiful and complete preservation.”

In its overall head and body shape, E. messelensis strongly resembles modern cicadas. Its rostrum — a snoutlike mouth — is intact, but closer analysis is needed to tell whether it used the rostrum for feeding on plant tissues called xylem, as most modern cicadas do, Labandeira said.

E. messelensis also shows hints of colors and patterns in its wings. This feature camouflages modern cicadas as they cling to tree trunks, and it may have served a similar purpose for E. messelensis, according to Jiang.

However, E. messelensis differs from modern cicadas in subtle ways. For example, its forewings are broader and less elongated than those of species alive today, which may have affected how it flew.

Would the ancient cicada’s call have sounded like those of its modern relatives? “We can’t know the exact song,” Jiang said. However, based on the cicada’s body shape and placement in the singing cicada group, “it likely produced sounds similar in function to modern cicadas.”

When Brood XIV emerges in the billions in the late spring and early summer of 2025, their calls will measure from 90 to 100 decibels — as loud as a subway train. Other types of cicadas produce an even bigger ruckus: Songs of the African cicada Brevisana brevis peak at nearly 107 decibels, about as loud as a jet taking off.

The volume of the ancient species’ songs may have been even louder than that, Jiang said. The abdomen of E. messelensis is broader and larger than those of its modern relatives, suggesting that males could have had a larger resonating cavity. This cavity may have amplified sound from the vibrating structures in their abdomens, called tymbals, to produce a louder buzz.

“Of course, this is only a hypothesis,” Jiang added. “Future studies on how morphology relates to sound production in modern cicadas will help to test it.”

ROACH: I recently read this morning that the shingles vaccine, Shingrix, “may have a protective effect against dementia.” It goes on to say the studies that have been conducted so far are only observational. Is this something that you could address? -- J.S.B.

ANSWER: There have been several studies showing that people who get a shingles vaccine (either the old one, Zostavax, which is no longer given, or the current vaccine, Shingrix, which provides longer-lasting benefit) are at a lower risk for developing dementia. However, in these kinds of studies, sometimes the people who get the vaccine are generally healthier and less likely to develop dementia anyway, so it’s impossible to be 100% sure that the vaccine is actually lowering the risk of dementia.

In the recent study that the news article was referring to, a change in the recommendations of who should get the shingles vaccine in the United Kingdom led to a large group of people being recommended the vaccine, while another large group of people who were almost the same age weren’t recommended the vaccine. In this way, the study was much closer to a randomized trial, which provides the highest degree of the evidence of a benefit.

In this study, those who had the Zostavax vaccine had a 3.5% point reduction in a new dementia diagnosis over seven years, which is equivalent to a 20% relative reduction in risk. The Shingrix vaccine would be expected to have an even greater benefit.

It has long been known that shingles increases the risk of stroke. Inflammation in the brain and blood vessels are suspected to cause the roughly double risk of stroke that is seen shortly after an episode of shingles. The increased risk for stroke goes down with time but is still present even a year after shingles.

Multiple stroke episodes are a leading cause of dementia, so it is biologically plausible that preventing shingles can reduce dementia by preventing blood vessel damage and strokes, although there may be other mechanisms at work.

Not getting painful shingles and its complication, post-herpetic neuralgia, is a good enough reason to recommend the shingles vaccine, but this new information makes getting the vaccine more important for adults over 50, even if they’ve had shingles or the old Zostavax vaccine.

DEAR DR. ROACH: I read that papaya seeds will clear out intestinal parasites. Should I use it? -- V.P.

ANSWER: I have heard about this as a social media trend. Studies in Africa, where there is a high rate of infection from worms like Ascaris (roundworm), Trichuris (whipworm) and Ancylostoma (hookworm), showed that dried papaya seeds decreased the rates of carriage. However, the risk of these worms in most areas of the United States and Canada is low.

Furthermore, the medications we have for diagnosed intestinal worms are much more effective than papaya seeds. The dosing and preparation of the seeds needs to be done carefully, and even when it’s properly done, there can be side effects. People with suspected intestinal parasites should get a medical evaluation instead of trying therapies that aren’t as effective as the standard ones and can’t treat the condition at hand.

How are we able to recall a word we want to say?

This basic ability, called word retrieval, is often compromised in patients with brain damage. Interestingly, many patients who can name words they see, like identifying a pet in the room as a “cat”, struggle with retrieving words in everyday discourse.

Scientists have long sought to understand how the brain retrieves words during speech. A new study by researchers at New York University sheds light on this mystery, revealing a left-lateralized network in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex that plays a crucial role in naming.

The findings, published in Cell Reports, provide new insights into the neural architecture of language, offering potential applications for both neuroscience and clinical interventions.

Mapping the Brain’s Naming Network

Word retrieval is a fundamental aspect of human communication, allowing us to link concepts to language. Despite decades of research, the exact neural dynamics underlying this process — particularly in natural auditory contexts — remain poorly understood.

NYU researchers — led by Biomedical Engineering Graduate Student Leyao Yu and Associate Professor of Biomedical Engineering at NYU Tandon and Neurology at NYU Grossman School of Medicine Adeen Flinker — recorded electrocorticographic (ECoG) data from 48 neurosurgical patients to examine the spatial and temporal organization of language processing in the brain.

By using unsupervised clustering techniques, the researchers identified two distinct but overlapping networks responsible for word retrieval.

The first, a semantic processing network, was located in the middle and inferior frontal gyri. This network was engaged in integrating meaning and was sensitive to how surprising a word was within a given sentence.

The second, an articulatory planning network, was situated in the inferior frontal and precentral gyri, which played a crucial role in speech production, regardless of whether words were presented visually or auditorily.

Auditory Naming and the Prefrontal Cortex

The study builds upon decades of work in language neuroscience. Previous research suggested that different regions of the brain were responsible for retrieving words depending on whether they were seen or heard.

However, earlier studies relied on methods with limited temporal resolution, leaving many unanswered questions about how these networks interact in real time.

By leveraging the high spatial and temporal resolution of ECoG, the researchers uncovered a striking ventral-dorsal gradient in the prefrontal cortex.

They found that while articulatory planning was localized ventrally, semantic processing was uniquely represented in a dorsal region of the inferior frontal gyrus and middle frontal gyrus — a previously underappreciated hub for language processing.

“These findings suggest that a missing piece in our understanding of language processing lies in this dorsal prefrontal region,” explains lead author Leyao Yu.

“Our study provides the first direct evidence that this area is involved in mapping sounds to meaning in an auditory context.”

Implications for Neuroscience and Medicine

The study has far-reaching implications, not only for theoretical neuroscience but also for clinical applications. Language deficits, such as anomia — the inability to retrieve words — are common in stroke, brain injury, and neurodegenerative disorders.

Understanding the precise neural networks involved in word retrieval could lead to better diagnostics and targeted rehabilitation therapies for patients suffering from these conditions.

Additionally, the study provides a roadmap for future research in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and neuroprosthetics.

By decoding the neural signals associated with naming, scientists could potentially develop assistive devices for individuals with speech impairments, allowing them to communicate more effectively through direct brain-computer communication.

For now, one thing is clear: our ability to name the world around us is not just a simple act of recall, but the result of a sophisticated and finely tuned neural system — one that is now being revealed in greater detail than ever before.

Abstract

A left-lateralized dorsolateral prefrontal network for naming

The ability to connect the form and meaning of a concept, known as word retrieval, is fundamental to human communication.

While various input modalities could lead to identical word retrieval, the exact neural dynamics supporting this process relevant to daily auditory discourse remain poorly understood.

Here, we recorded neurosurgical electrocorticography (ECoG) data from 48 patients and dissociated two key language networks that highly overlap in time and space, critical for word retrieval.

Using unsupervised temporal clustering techniques, we found a semantic processing network located in the middle and inferior frontal gyri.

This network was distinct from an articulatory planning network in the inferior frontal and precentral gyri, which was invariant to input modalities.

Functionally, we confirmed that the semantic processing network encodes word surprisal during sentence perception.

These findings elucidate neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the processing of semantic auditory inputs ranging from passive language comprehension to conversational speech.","Researchers used high-resolution electrocorticography in 48 patients to reveal that semantic processing and articulatory planning occur in neighboring yet functionally distinct regions.

MURRAY — Ann Itchon says she will never forget the sound of her husband falling in the bathroom the night he suffered a stroke.

On Jan. 23, 2024, Ted Itchon woke up around 2 a.m. to use the bathroom and lost his balance, causing him to collapse onto the floor. Ann found him quickly after and called 911. She says she had no idea what was wrong until she overheard a paramedic saying Ted might be having a stroke.

In the time it took Ann Itchon to leave their house and meet her husband at the hospital emergency room, first responders had already assessed Ted and provided him a stroke-stopping medication that prevented further damage to his brain.

Dr. Paul Johnson, medical director of the Comprehensive Stroke Program at Intermountain Medical Center, and the neurologist who treated Ted Itchon that night, explained that medical staff work as fast as possible when treating a stroke patient because, for every second they are experiencing a stroke, 32,000 neurons in the brain die.

""A stroke is a very time-sensitive disease. When somebody is having a stroke, it's just a matter of time until you have a permanent brain injury,"" said Johnson. ""We often say, in the stroke world, that 'time is brain.' Every minute you delay care, it costs brain cells. The sooner somebody comes into the hospital, the sooner we can intervene and prevent that injury from happening.""

Utah was recently ranked as the top state for providing the fastest stroke treatment in the nation by the American Heart Association, according to Intermountain Health.

The American Heart Association recommends that patients receive a tissue plasminogen activator medication to dissolve blood clots in the brain within 60 minutes of arriving at the hospital. In Utah, 87.1% of stroke patients received the medication within 45 minutes of their arrival, making it the only state in the country reaching that goal for over 85% of patients. Furthermore, Intermountain Health reports 94.5% of patients arriving at its stroke centers receive the medication within 45 minutes, and 88% receive it in 30 minutes or less.

To improve its door-to-needle time, Johnson says Intermountain Health has implemented changes such as having the blood clot-dissolving medication premixed, expediting CT scans, and improving the emergency department workflow overall. The health care system also has a stroke neurologist on staff 24/7 to ensure patients can be diagnosed and treated as quickly as possible.

""We have been able to treat patients very quickly because we — along with our sister hospitals in the state — have focused very intensely on assessing patients, when they come to the hospitals, as quickly as possible,"" said Johnson. ""We have worked very closely with EMS crews, with the ER doctors, with our nurses in the ER, to make sure that we shave off every minute that we can ... so that when a patient like Ted comes in, we are very quickly able to get the data that we need.""

When a patient arrives at the emergency room, medical staff must be able to determine definitively that the patient is having a stroke before administering the medication to stop it. They also need to verify the patient's medical history and what medications they may be taking to ensure nothing will interfere with the stroke treatment medication.

In Ted Ichton's case, doctors also had to perform a thrombectomy, or surgical procedure to remove blood clots from arteries in the brain, in addition to administering the tissue plasminogen activator medication. Because his specialized stroke team was able to move so quickly in treating him, Ted Itchon says most people he meets don't even know he suffered a stroke.

""I can't tell you how much I appreciate the doctors. They were fantastic, and I enjoyed them, even though I wanted to get out (of the hospital). I don't even know how to explain the gratitude I have,"" he said. ""If it wasn't for Ann and her diligence, her quickness of calling 911, I would probably be less than what I am now.""

Ted Itchon was able to return home just four days after his stroke. While he still required outpatient physical therapy sessions to help him recover some speech skills and treat his foot that was affected by the stroke, Johnson says Ted Itchon experienced a relatively speedy recovery thanks to the quick door-to-needle time he received.

Typically, a stroke occurs when a blood clot blocks an artery, preventing blood flow and oxygen delivery to the brain, which can result in the death of brain cells. Strokes are most common in older adults — especially those with high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes — but can happen to anyone, according to Johnson. As strokes are the fifth-leading cause of death in the U.S., he encourages people to be informed so they can help themselves or loved ones suffering from a stroke.

""We always like to remind people that we use the mnemonic device BEFAST to remind patients and the public what to look out for for a stroke: sudden severe balance problems, eye problems — so vision loss on one side or the other — facial droop, arm weakness, speech problems .. and then 'T' is time, so time to call 911 and time to come in and seek treatment,"" said Johnson.

After calling 911, Johnson says one of the best things a loved one can do to expedite the door-to-needle time for someone suffering from a stroke is to know what medications they take and be prepared to provide their medical history. Most stroke patients are unable to speak clearly or coherently, so having a family member or friend's number to contact for information can help first responders and hospital staff.

Finally, prevention can be the best medicine for some stroke patients, according to Johnson. While not all strokes are preventable, 80% are if patients receive treatment for conditions that make them higher risk for stroke, like high blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes and smoking.

Suffered by 80 to 100million Americans, the disease often develops silently, causing minimal or no symptoms - but it can lead to inflammation in the body linked to cancer.

The most common kind is caused by alcohol, though sugary diets, obesity and smoking can lead to non-alcoholic liver disease (NAFLD).

The team found people under 50 with a history of NAFLD were up to 24 percent more likely to develop colon cancer than people without the condition.

And people who showed early signs of the disease had a 12 percent greater risk than people with no history of liver disease.

The researchers suggested the inflammation caused by NAFLD may travel to the colon, damaging cell DNA and leading to the formation of cancer cells.

The team South Korea said that while more research is needed, early colon cancer screening should be adopted for people with NAFLD.

In the study of nearly 5million adults ages 20 to 49, men living with NAFLD were also 17 percent more likely than women to be struck by colorectal cancer.

The researchers tied this to men being more likely to smoke and be obese, risk factors for liver disease.

Writing in the study, they said: 'Our findings revealed a strong link between NAFLD and early-onset CRC in young adults, suggesting the importance of implementing effective preventive strategies, particularly in populations with a growing burden of metabolic dysfunction.'

The findings come as colorectal cancer surges in young Americans, with rates in under-50s increasing from 8.6 cases per 100,000 people to 13 cases per 100,000 people in the last two decades.

The study, published in the journal Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology, evaluated 4.6million adults in South Korea ages 20 to 49 from a South Korean insurance database.

Of those, 2,733 developed early-onset colorectal cancer after an average of nine years.

Each participant underwent routine health checks in 2009 and was followed until 2019.

All participants were grouped into four categories: NAFLD, borderline NAFLD or no NAFLD.

Fatty liver is diagnosed through a combination of physical exams, blood tests, and imaging studies, including ultrasound, CT scans, or MRIs.

About 11 percent were diagnosed with NAFLD, 19 percent were borderline and 70 percent had no history of the condition. Participants in the NAFLD group tended to be older and male, smokers and mild-to-moderate drinkers.

They also tended to have a higher BMI, waist circumference and blood pressure, all risk factors for liver disease.

After taking risk factors into account, patients with NAFLD had a 24 percent increased risk of developing early colon cancer, and those in the borderline NAFLD group had a 12 percent higher chance compared to people without the condition.

And of those with NAFLD, men were 17 percent more likely than women to develop colorectal cancer.

As well as men living generally unhealthier lives, the researchers suggested the gender divide could be because the female sex hormone estrogen has been shown to promote the growth of healthy bacteria in the gut and protect against inflammation.

Smoking, a risk factor for NAFLD, is also more common in men, and women are more likely to eat non-inflammatory fruits and vegetables.

NAFLD patients in their 20s were also 24 percent more likely to develop colon cancer than people in their 30s and 11 percent more likely than patients in their 40s.

The likelihood of developing colon cancer was also 18 percent greater for non-diabetics compared to people with diabetes, leading the experts to suggest NAFLD may be a better indicator of colon cancer risk than diabetes.

The researchers wrote: 'To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to provide clinical evidence supporting a correlation between NAFLD and early-onset CRC.'

The team suggested NAFLD and early-onset colorectal cancer could be connected through shared 'inflammatory pathways.'

Symptoms of fatty liver disease can be difficult to notice at first, other than fatigue. However, as the disease progresses, symptoms such as swelling, red palms, and jaundice appear

NAFLD creates inflammation that damages cell DNA and causes cells to rapidly replicate, increasing the risk of cancerous cells forming.

According to the researchers, chronic liver inflammation also releases cytokines - signaling proteins that communicate with the immune system - which promote the growth of cancer cells.

NAFLD also disrupts the function of bile acids, which leads to imbalances in the gut microbiome, a risk factor for colorectal cancer.

Additionally, NAFLD raised the risk of tumors specifically in the lower left side of the colon and the rectum, suggesting the condition targets lower areas of the colon and rectum, though the exact mechanism is unclear.

There were several limitations, including a lack of data on family history, colon cancer stage and colonoscopy history.

The researchers wrote: 'These findings highlight the need for multifaceted preventive strategies, including lifestyle interventions and expanded screening for younger populations with NAFLD.'","Scientists have discovered a link between early-onset colon cancer and fatty liver disease, a condition where excessive fat accumulates in the liver.

If the results hold, the implications could be enormous — not just for Parkinson’s, but for other neurodegenerative diseases too. Huntington’s, ALS, even Alzheimer’s could be future targets for similar cell-replacement strategies.

Changes before and after the procedure. Image from the study.

Parkinson’s disease is a progressive brain disorder that affects movement, balance, and coordination. It begins subtly, often with tremors in one hand or a slight stiffness in the limbs. But over time, it chips away at a person’s ability to walk, speak, and live independently. It’s estimated that 10 million people live with Parkinson’s, and is prevalence is rising fast as populations age.

The culprit is the gradual loss of dopamine-producing neurons in a part of the brain called the substantia nigra. Without enough dopamine, the brain’s signals to the muscles falter. There’s currently no cure for Parkinson’s disease, just treatments to slow down progression and deal with some of the effects.

Scientists have had the idea to replace dead cells directly in the brain for decades. In the 1980s and ’90s, some researchers tried transplanting fetal brain tissue into patients, but the results were inconsistent. Some patients improved, others didn’t. Tumors and uncontrolled movements were common side effects. And the ethical concerns surrounding fetal tissue never went away.

This new study from Japan takes a new approach to this idea. Instead of fetal tissue, researchers used induced pluripotent stem (iPS) — adult cells that have been genetically reprogrammed to behave like embryonic stem cells. These versatile cells can be turned into nearly any cell type in the body. And that includes the dopamine-producing neurons that Parkinson’s destroys.

Promising, though not perfect

Seven patients were enrolled in the study. One dropped out before surgery due to a COVID-19 infection, and another received the transplant in two stages and was evaluated only for safety (not for drug efficacy).

None of the patients had any major side effects and four showed improvements in movement when off their usual medications. Their average motor scores improved by 20%, and brain scans confirmed that the implanted cells were producing dopamine. A fifth patient improved while on medication. One patient didn’t improve, but their symptoms didn’t worsen either.

The gains were modest but meaningful. One patient improved by two stages on the Hoehn–Yahr scale, a widely used measure of Parkinson’s severity. Another saw a 50% improvement in motor function during off-medication testing.

“It is a significant achievement that we have been able to confirm improvement in patients’ symptoms,” said Jun Takahashi, director of Kyoto University’s Center for iPS Cell Research and Application, who is leading the research. “We hope to deliver this treatment to patients as soon as possible.”

Dopamine is back, to an extent

Researchers carried out brain scans to see how much dopamine production increased. They used a specialized tracer and found that in the patients that received the highest dose, dopamine increased by an average of 63.5%; in the low-dose group, it rose by just 7%.

Notably, in three patients, dopamine activity increased only in specific parts of the brain — right where the cells were injected. That local boost was still enough to improve symptoms in some cases, but there was no generalized return of dopamine production.

Still, the study authors are confident.

This trial is the most advanced test yet of iPS-cell-derived neurons in human patients — and the results may open the door to regulatory approval. Sumitomo Pharma, the company which helped manufacture the cells, plans to seek approval to manufacture and sell the treatment in Japan by the end of fiscal 2025. If successful, it would become only the second approved iPS-cell-based regenerative medicine product in the country, after a treatment for heart disease.

The team’s goal is to develop a standardized, off-the-shelf cell therapy that can be administered to a wide population. The cells used in this study were derived from a donor whose genetic immune profile matches about 17% of the Japanese population, reducing the risk of rejection.

Japan has made regenerative medicine a priority. It was the first country to approve clinical use of iPS cells, and it continues to lead in funding and infrastructure for stem cell-based treatments. This trial may put Japan at the forefront of a new era in neuroscience.

The results of an international study led by researchers from Queen Mary University of London’s Precision Healthcare University Research Institute (PHURI) shed new light the underlying biological mechanisms which cause differences in health risks, symptoms and outcomes between males and females.

The study, carried out in collaboration with the Berlin Institute of Health at Charité, Universitätsmedizin Berlin, and the Medical Research Council (MRC) Epidemiology Unit at the University of Cambridge, was published today in Nature Communications.

Using data from UK Biobank and the Fenland study, the team carried an in-depth analysis of the genetic links between ~6,000 proteins and hundreds of diseases in 56,000 males and females.

The team found that for two-thirds of these proteins, their levels differed between males and females. Further examination revealed that only a very small fraction, around 100 proteins out of the 6,000 studied, had differences in the genetic ‘switches’ which control their levels, when compared between males and females.

These findings, which may have implications for drug development, indicate that while there are differences between the sexes in relation to how much they express certain proteins, what’s causing these differences isn’t solely down to differences in their genetics.

Instead, the authors highlight the importance of looking beyond genetics – and other medical factors such as hormones – when comparing health risks and outcomes between males and females.

Their findings indicate that non-medical factors such as where people work and live, their education, financial situation, access to resources, as well as their lifestyle also contribute to the health differences experiences between the sexes and so should be explored further and considered more when exploring sex differences in health.

Mine Koprulu, lead author of the study and a postdoctoral researcher at Queen Mary’s PHURI, said: “For the first time in history, we are able to study human biology at this level of detail—across genes, proteins, and more. This is the largest study to date exploring the similarities and differences in how our genetic code regulates blood protein levels between sexes.

“Our findings highlight the need to better understand the factors that impact health differences — at the genetic level and beyond— to create more tailored and equitable healthcare for everyone.”

Professor Claudia Langenberg, Director of the PHURI at Queen Mary and Professor of Computational Medicine at the Berlin Institute of Health at Charité, Germany, said: “Drug development pipelines increasingly incorporate information on genetic differences in protein levels and function and this has led to large investment in human cohorts, such as UK Biobank.

“From this perspective, better understanding of population differences in the regulation of proteins, such as those between males and females, is essential to guide precision medicine approaches and identify where one size may not fit all.

“Our results clearly show that with very few exceptions, protein regulating genetic variants identified so far behave in a very similar way in males and females. This provides evidence for an important implicit assumption – that insights arising from studying these variants apply to both sexes.”

In this study, data was categorised as male or female based on chromosomal information (XX or XY). The authors acknowledge that chromosomal information does not always align with an individual’s gender identity.

However, for the purposes of this study (genetic and protein-level scientific analyses), this categorisation was necessary, and data on gender identity was not reliably recoded meaning it could not be consistently used across all data.

“Sex differences in the genetic regulation of the human plasma proteome” by Mine Koprulu et al. Nature Communications

Abstract

Sex differences in the genetic regulation of the human plasma proteome

Mechanisms underlying sex differences in the development and prognosis of many diseases remain largely elusive.

Here, we systematically investigated sex differences in the genetic regulation of plasma proteome (>5800 protein targets) across two cohorts (30,307 females; 26,058 males).

Plasma levels of two-thirds of protein targets differ significantly by sex. In contrast, genetic effects on protein targets are remarkably similar across sexes, with only 103 sex-differential protein quantitative loci (sd-pQTLs; for 2.9% and 0.3% of protein targets from antibody- and aptamer-based platforms, respectively).

A third of those show evidence of sexual discordance, i.e., effects observed in one sex only (n = 30) or opposite effect directions (n = 1 for CDH15).

Phenome-wide analyses of 365 outcomes in UK Biobank did not provide evidence that the identified sd-pQTLs accounted for sex-differential disease risk.

Our results demonstrate similarities in the genetic regulation of protein levels by sex with important implications for genetically-guided drug target discovery and validation.","These findings challenge the assumption that genetic differences alone explain sex-based health disparities.

2025-05-12 00:00:00,2025-05-12 00:00:00 +08,https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2025/05/12/ai-tool-biological-age-faceage/,New AI tool predicts your biological age from a selfie,"Our faces suggest our true age and even how much time we may have left on Earth. While doctors learn to form a picture of a patient’s health from their face, using what they call “the eyeball test,” new research in the Lancet Digital Health indicates that this may be a job that artificial intelligence can enhance in the future.

Scientists at Mass General Brigham in Boston have developed and carried out some initial testing of an AI tool called FaceAge, an algorithm designed to tell patients’ biological age from a photograph as simple as a selfie ― not how old they are in years, but how old they are in health.

Biological age is considered crucial in helping doctors determine the most appropriate therapy, such as whether a cancer patient is healthy enough to tolerate an aggressive treatment. FaceAge requires more testing before doctors can begin using it routinely, but scientists said that in the next week or two, they expect to begin enrolling about 50 patients in a pilot study.

Researchers said they trained FaceAge using about 59,000 photographs of people ages 60 and older who were presumed to be healthy. Most of the photos were publicly available on Wikipedia and the internet movie database IMDb, while some came from UTKFace, a large-scale dataset with pictures of people from less than a year old to 116 years old.

The developers of FaceAge tested it on a group of 6,200 cancer patients, using photographs taken at the start of radiotherapy treatment. The algorithm determined that when it came to their health, cancer patients were, on average, about five years older than their chronological age. Moreover, the tool found that the older their faces looked, the worse their survival outlook.

Scientists then conducted an experiment in which they asked eight doctors to determine whether terminal cancer patients would be alive in six months based first on the patient’s photograph alone, then on the photograph and clinical information, and finally based on FaceAge and clinical information.

“We found that doctors on average can predict life expectancy with an accuracy that’s only a little better than a coin flip,” when using a photo alone for their analysis, said Raymond Mak, a radiation oncologist at Mass General Brigham and one of the lead investigators for the study.

When using a photo alone, the doctors were right about 61 percent of the time. Given photos and clinical information on the patients, they were right about 74 percent of the time. Provided with FaceAge and medical chart information, the doctors’ accuracy reached 80 percent.

In a news conference last week, Mak said he tested FaceAge using the photograph of a patient whom he first met four years ago, an 86-year-old man with terminal lung cancer.

“Some doctors would hesitate to offer cancer treatment to someone in their late 80s or 90s with the rationale that the patient may die of other causes before the cancer progresses and becomes life-threatening,” Mak said. “But he looked younger than 86 to me, and based on the eyeball test and a host of other factors, I decided to treat him with aggressive radiation therapy.”

Several years later, when Mak ran the man’s photograph through FaceAge, “we found he’s more than 10 years younger than his chronological age.” The patient is now 90, “and still doing great,” Mak said.

Researchers stressed that FaceAge is not intended to replace a doctor’s assessment, but rather to provide an objective measure to help fill out a clinical picture.

“I think it’s really important to know that different people age at different rates, and, as they’re showing here, that clearly seems to have a major effect on their actual prognosis,” said Gary Schwartz, a scientist at University Health Network’s Princess Margaret Cancer Center in Toronto, who was not involved in the research.

Having a face with a lot of mileage on it, however, does not necessarily doom someone to an early grave.

In a second demonstration of FaceAge, the developers had it analyze photographs of actors Paul Rudd and Wilford Brimley when each man was 50. The algorithm determined that Rudd’s biological age was about 43; Brimley’s was almost 69 (though he would live to 85).

Irbaz Riaz, an assistant professor of medicine and senior associate consultant in the department of AI and informatics at Mayo Clinic, called FaceAge “a promising early-stage tool.”

While the tool does not replace a doctor’s experience, said Riaz, who did not work on the study, “it could standardize the subtle visual assessments we make every day. That said, clinicians will need to understand how the model was trained, when it might be biased and where it could add value without overstepping its role.”

Nasim Eftekhari, vice president of applied AI and advanced analytics at City of Hope cancer treatment and research center in Duarte, California, who did not participate in the study, called the tool “an incremental improvement,” saying, “if this goes through validation and bias testing and approvals, and all of that, this could be an additional biomarker, at best,” to go with cancer stage, characteristics of the tumor and other factors.

Developers of FaceAge acknowledged that should the technology be approved by the Food and Drug Administration, ethical guidelines will need to be established to govern its use and access to its information.

“This technology can do a lot of good, but it could also potentially do some harm,” said Hugo Aerts, director of the Artificial Intelligence in Medicine program at Mass General Brigham and another lead investigator on the FaceAge study.

Aerts said hospitals have “very strong governance committees and regulatory guidelines that they have to adhere to [to] make sure these AI technologies are being used in the right way, really only for the benefit of the patients” and not for others, such as insurers.

Privacy has been a key concern for earlier technologies that attempt to show how we might use age based on a photo, such as FaceApp.

Although initial testing of FaceAge focused on cancer patients, the scientists plan also to measure its performance for other conditions.

Aerts said that the tool still needs to be trained to deal with numerous variables that can affect a photograph of a face: lighting, makeup, skin tone and, of course, our attempts to look younger through plastic surgery.

“So this is something that we are actively investigating and researching,” Aerts said. “We’re now testing in various datasets [to see] how we can make the algorithm robust against this.”

While the tool still has much to learn, we may have something to learn from it, too.

“It is important to know that the algorithm looks at age differently than humans do,” Aerts said. “So, for example, being bald or not, or being gray is less important in the algorithm than we actually initially thought.”","Researchers said they trained FaceAge using about 59,000 photographs of people ages 60 and older who were presumed to be healthy.

Become an Insider and start reading now.

Colon cancer is rising in people under 50. James Kinross, a gastrointestinal surgeon who researches how the gut microbiome affects our risk of the disease, told Business Insider that poor gut health could be partly to blame.

Research suggests the gut microbiome, the trillions of microbes that live in the digestive tract, has a wide-ranging effect on our health. But our sterile, urbanized lifestyles, appear to have made them less diverse overall and, therefore, weaker, according to Kinross, who is based at Imperial College London.

""You're seeing a generational loss in our internal ecology, which is being hammered with a series of environmental hits that it simply cannot adapt to,"" he said, referring to factors including microplastics, ultra-processed foods, and minimal access to nature. Many studies have linked these changes in the gut microbiome to an increase in colon cancer risk.

But, the gut microbiome is changeable, meaning there are things we can do to increase its diversity, which in turn could help lower colon cancer risk. ""It is an ecosystem which you can adapt, and you can modify,"" he said.

Kinross previously shared with BI how he eats to boost his gut microbiome. He shared the three things he does aside from healthy eating to lower his colon cancer risk.

Don't take antibiotics if you don't need to

As a surgeon, Kinross is acutely aware that antibiotics are often necessary and save millions of lives each year, but he believes we use them too liberally — particularly to treat viral infections they can't tackle.

""In my house, to qualify for antibiotics, you've really got to have a pathogen that you need treated,"" Kinross said.

Kinross and his family limit their use of antibiotics as much as possible because taking them can disrupt the ecosystem of the gut microbiome, killing off good bacteria along with pathogens, and reducing diversity.

He likened it to pouring weed killer all over your garden. ""Your garden won't really grow into a lovely garden full of wild meadows and flowers and color. It will just be brown and lifeless,"" he said.

Take vitamin D

Vitamin D is crucial for several biological processes, including calcium absorption and cellular repair — but also keeps the lining of the small intestine strong. If the lining becomes weak, microbes can pass through it into the bloodstream and cause inflammation. Chronic inflammation is linked to a higher risk of chronic diseases, including cancer.

Vitamin D is found in foods including oily fish, egg yolks, and red meat, as well as from sunlight. In countries with climates like the UK's, where Kinross lives, it can be difficult to get enough vitamin D in the colder months, and residents are advised to supplement from October to March.

Socialize

Social connections are a pillar of health. pixdeluxe/Getty Images

Kinross goes cycling with friends regularly and makes sure to sit down to eat dinner with his family in the evenings. As well as being a pillar of overall health, research suggests that socializing positively impacts the composition of our gut microbiomes, Kinross said.

We exchange microbes through physical touch, and studies have found that friends, family members, and spouses have similar gut microbes to one another.

A 2024 study published in the journal Nature, based on 1,787 adults from 18 isolated villages in Honduras, found that people in the same social network shared more similarities in their gut microbiomes compared to those outside of it. This was regardless of diet, water sources, and medications. Spouses and people living together had the highest amount of microbial sharing, but the phenomenon still occurred among friends and even friends of friends.

""Our social interactions, our real-world social interactions, define so much of our health,"" Kinross said. ""It's good for all aspects of our health. It's good for our mental health, it's good for our cardiovascular health. It's good for everything. But if you're not having real-world social interaction, you are not really optimizing your gut health, I believe.""","Many studies have linked these changes in the gut microbiome to an increase in colon cancer risk.

But just a year later, the 39-year-old from Franklin, New York, suddenly couldn't breathe and felt like she was suffocating.

She was rushed to the hospital — where doctors made a devastating diagnosis and said she could die at any moment.

Physicians said vaping had severely damaged her lungs, causing inflammation and fluid buildup that made it harder to breathe.

Her collapsed lung could no longer expand and contract properly, and even slight movements risked rupturing more fragile air sacs.

Her doctors warned her lungs were like a 'ticking time bomb'.

She had to stop vaping immediately and could no longer lie flat — not even to sleep. Instead, she was forced to sleep upright in a recliner.

Lying down, they cautioned, could trigger more ruptures and internal bleeding that might flood her lungs with fluid — ultimately suffocating her.

Loyda Cordero Galiero, 39, was left fighting for her life after she switched from smoking to vaping, believing she had made a healthy choice

She also could not do any exercise in case the strain burst the air-sacs, even something as simple as cooking or carrying groceries.

The lungs are made up of tiny balloon-like structures called alveoli, or air sacs, which are responsible for exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide.

When these sacs are damaged or burst — as can happen with severe inflammation or pressure changes — it can lead to bleeding, fluid buildup, and a dangerous loss of lung function.

Galiero said she was a pack-a-day smoker before switching to vaping. But once she started using e-cigarettes, she would puff 'like crazy'.

She said: 'With a cigarette, you can put it out and do what you've got to do.

'But with a vape it's like a cell phone — it's literally stuck in your hand 24/7 and you're hitting it even when you don't want to hit it just because it's there.'

She added: 'It's horrible. Vaping is 100 percent more dangerous than cigarettes.'

Doctors say vaping can be healthier than smoking because it doesn't involve burning tobacco, which is what produces the most harmful chemicals in cigarette smoke.

But physicians also say that using vapes regularly — particularly those not approved by the FDA — can cause complications.

Smoke from the devices contains propylene glycol — made from petroleum — that can inflame the airways, leading blood to leak into the lungs.

Galiero didn't say what brand she was using, or what flavors — but many are attracted to vapes for their appealing and often fruity tastes.

She added that she was 'so proud' when she had made the switch from smoking to vaping, and was never once warned about the potential risks.

After she was rushed to the ER in March this year, when she choked on a sip of a drink, doctors diagnosed her with pulmonary bullae — or when large air-filled spaces open up in the lungs when lung tissue is destroyed.

She was told she would need to quit vaping before having surgery, which would likely involve removing fluid-filled areas of her lungs.

Galiero, from New York state, is pictured above in her hospital bed after doctors said that vaping had put her life at risk

After quitting, she underwent surgery on April 30 — and is still there now recovering from the procedure.

Galiero said: 'My doctor said that my lung collapsed because they were building up with the liquid from my vape and one of the pulmonary bullae ended up rupturing.'

She added: 'My esophagus is out of place to where the pulmonary bullae sac is putting pressure onto that and if that ruptures, it could cause... internal bleeding which could kill me instantly.'

Speaking before the surgery, she added: 'It's causing a lot of problems.

'If I lay down when sleeping instead of sitting up I can choke to death on my own spit or I can suffocate and die.

'I literally have to sit up in bed or on a recliner when I sleep because I'm no longer allowed to sleep lying down until after the surgery — it's pretty much a life or death situation.'

Doctors say that it is healthier not to use cigarettes or vapes than to use either of the devices.

They warn that many vapes sold in the US are not FDA-approved, and have been shipped into the US from other countries — often China.

The mother-of-two underwent grueling surgery to repair her lungs, and is now recovering from it in the hospital

Vaping was initially approved in the US as a method to help people quit smoking, with some experts saying it was '95 percent less dangerous'.

But this is dependent on how often people use the devices, with many reporting that they puff on them far more than they ever smoked cigarettes.

About 6.5 percent of US adults vape, according to the CDC, equivalent to about 16.7million people in the country.

It isn't clear how many are sickened by the devices every year, but the CDC reports that between 2019 and 2020 there were 2,800 hospitalizations and 68 deaths due to lung damage from the devices. Numbers now are likely much higher.

The FDA has authorized 34 tobacco- and menthol-flavored e-cigarette devices to date, which underwent rigorous scientific review. It has not approved any vapes with fruity flavors.","She was rushed to the hospital — where doctors made a devastating diagnosis and said she could die at any moment.

Indulging in a delicious food item daily could potentially reduce your risk of a severe health condition by up to 28 per cent, research suggests. A study has indicated that a particular fruit could significantly decrease your likelihood of developing dementia.

Dementia is a syndrome characterised by a continuous decline in brain function. Symptoms can range from memory loss and behavioural changes to mobility issues.

While certain factors increasing the risk of dementia are beyond our control, such as genetics, age, and injury, others can be mitigated through lifestyle changes. Research indicates that approximately 45 per cent of dementia cases could be prevented with specific alterations.

Scientists also propose that our diet influences our risk of dementia. A study published in JAMA Network Open revealed that consuming one serving of berries daily could reduce your dementia risk by up to 28 per cent.

This is believed to be due to a chemical called flavonoids present in berries. These flavonoids are responsible for the vibrant colour of the fruit.

Flavonoids can also be found in other colourful foods like peppers, oranges, grapes, and even red wine. For this study, researchers tracked over 121,000 individuals without dementia (aged between 40 and 70) in the UK for about nine years.

The researchers examined their health and dietary data, including the daily consumption of various flavonoid-rich foods and beverages such as black or green tea, apples, berries, grapes, oranges, onions, peppers, dark chocolate, and red wine.

Harvard Health experts in the US, commenting on the study, stated: ""People who ate the most flavonoid-rich foods - six servings per day - had a 28 per cent lower risk of developing dementia during the study period, compared to those who ate the least. The link was especially strong among people with high blood pressure, depression, or a high genetic risk for dementia, as well as people who consumed at least two of the following each day: half a serving of berries, five cups of tea, or a glass of red wine.""

The authors of the study remarked: ""The findings from this large prospective cohort study of more than 120 000 UK Biobank participants suggest that consuming six additional servings per day of flavonoid-rich foods, specifically tea, red wine, and berries, was associated with a lower risk of dementia, with the strongest associations observed for tea. We were also able to show, for the first time in our knowledge, that these associations were evident in participants at high genetic risk of dementia and those with modifiable risk factors, including depression and hypertension, but not in those without.""

What does other research say?

Berries have once again been linked to a potential reduction in dementia risk. A 2021 study published in the Neurology journal underscored the positive impact of flavonoids on cognitive health.

The research was spearheaded by experts from Harvard Medical School who shared findings on their website stating: ""After accounting for factors that could have affected cognition (such as age, weight, physical activity, alcohol intake, depression, and intake of nutrients other than flavonoids), scientists found that people with the highest daily flavonoid intakes were 19 per cent less likely to report trouble with memory and thinking, compared with people who had the lowest daily flavonoid intakes.""

The study identified specific fruits and vegetables, such as strawberries, blueberries, peppers, celery, apples, bananas, oranges, and grapefruit, as being particularly associated with cognitive benefits. Although the study was observational and cannot conclusively prove that high flavonoid intake maintains mental sharpness in older age, smaller studies have observed similar links.

Researchers recommend aiming for a ""goal"" of consuming five portions of fruits and vegetables each day and suggest eating ""a rainbow"" to ensure a diet rich in variety for optimal brain and overall health.

Dementia symptoms

The NHS outlines that dementia can manifest differently across individuals, with everyone experiencing symptoms in their own way. However, there are some common early signs that might emerge well before a formal diagnosis of dementia is made.

The symptoms encompass:

Memory loss

Difficulty concentrating

Challenges in performing familiar daily tasks, such as confusion over the correct change when shopping

Struggles to follow a conversation or find the right word

Confusion about time and place

Mood changes.

These symptoms often start off mild and progressively worsen over time. If you or someone you know is exhibiting signs of dementia, it's important to consult with a doctor.","More infoIndulging in a delicious food item daily could potentially reduce your risk of a severe health condition by up to 28 per cent, research suggests.

He stepped out into his backyard atop the Pacific Palisades in early January to find a raging fire leaping from three houses away to two. He gathered his family, helped older neighbors to their cars and fled without a single keepsake.

In the days that followed, Dr. Elsayegh, a pulmonologist, did not have a chance to grieve. As he did his rounds with patients at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif., his cellphone was bombarded with neighbors and friends seeking his expert advice.

What kind of air purifier?

Is an N-95 mask enough?

My daughter has asthma — should we rent a place farther away?

“Forty phone calls a day with the same set of questions,” Dr. Elsayegh recalled.

So when the chief administrative officer of the hospital invited him into his office to ask Dr. Elsayegh how he could support him and his family, Dr. Elsayegh replied instead, “Let’s open a clinic.”

Just three weeks after the blaze tore through neighborhoods of Los Angeles, the hospital’s urban fire clinic for pulmonary issues began seeing patients. They came in droves, each with a different set of symptoms and concerns. The clinic has served as an early indicator of the types of health problems developing among those exposed to the fires, ranging from newfound shortness of breath in healthy people to exacerbated symptoms in patients with asthma, C.O.P.D. and other lung diseases.

The health effects of an urban fire differ from a those of a wildfire, and when an entire community burns quickly, releasing unquantifiable toxins in unexpected directions for an unknowable period of time, there are long-term health effects that no expert can yet fully calculate. Dr. Elsayegh is making it his mission to support patients from the Palisades and surrounding communities for months and years into the future, when, he fears, cleanup crew members and others with chronic exposure may begin to show signs of severe lung diseases, like asbestosis and silicosis, and even cancers like mesothelioma.","He stepped out into his backyard atop the Pacific Palisades in early January to find a raging fire leaping from three houses away to two.

A new theory suggests that we don't just listen to it; our bodies physically resonate with music, as our brains' natural oscillations synchronize with structures like rhythm and pitch.

Music is often thought of as a 'universal language' – people across cultures will bust out similar moves, and young kids will instinctively bop to a beat.

According to neural resonance theory, it's not just that we learn to expect and predict what's coming; aspects like harmony in the music we make and enjoy sound so good to us because they're in sync with the brain's resonant patterns.

""This theory suggests that music is powerful not just because we hear it, but because our brains and bodies become it,"" says Caroline Palmer, neuroscientist at McGill University in Canada. ""That has big implications for therapy, education, and technology.""

It's not a coincidence, of course. As humans messed around with music over millennia, we figured out what sounds best without necessarily understanding why.

Neural resonance theory (NRT) has now been formally described by Palmer and co-authors in a perspective paper reviewing the literature on musical neuroscience.

One of the key suggestions of NRT is that neural oscillations synchronize with external audio at different rates. On the slower end of the timescale is what we call rhythm, with distinct beats you can dance or bang a drum to. Neurons in the cortex oscillate at frequencies that resonate with those pulses in the music.

Higher frequencies, from about 30 to over 4,000 Hertz, are perceived as pitch. Gamma-frequency oscillations in the cortex sync up with the lower end of that, while the auditory nerve, brain stem, and cochlea resonate at the higher pitches.

This all comes together to make music pleasurable regardless of musical background – from young children to classically trained pros.

""Statistically universal structures may have arisen in music because they correspond to stable states of complex, pattern-forming dynamical systems,"" the authors explain.

That's not to say that there's no learned factor to appreciating music; the team says that aspects like pulse and more complex structures like meter can vary widely based on culture.

Simple pulses, like one you might clap to or bounce a baby on your knee to, develop more quickly and become stronger over time, but more complex structures are culture-specific. Over time, the brain oscillations showed bias towards those learned structures, called attunement.

Other aspects covered by NRT include groove, which is basically the urge to move your body to music. When a beat doesn't follow a predictable pulse but falls between pulses to a degree, the brain has to fill in the blanks – which the team calls nonlinear resonance.

""High groove ratings"" required just the right amount of this nonlinear resonance. Of course, music that's too disjointed isn't groovy enough to dance to either. Understandably, pop music tends to fall right in the middle of that range.

The paper also explores how NRT explains various other aspects of music, and what we can learn by applying it to this universal joy.

""NRT can provide insights into both neuroscience and human behavior, as well as the link between the two,"" the researchers write.

""Such insights can shed light on the interconnectedness of brain and body, the ability of music to communicate affect and emotion, the role of music in interpersonal bonding, and applications of music to brain health.""

The perspective was published in the journal Nature Reviews Neuroscience.","A new theory suggests that we don't just listen to it; our bodies physically resonate with music, as our brains' natural oscillations synchronize with structures like rhythm and pitch.

The energy drink cans are the colors of a tropical beach sunset — aqua and tangerine and neon pink — so they really pop when lined up for fridge organizing shots on TikTok. They’re sugar-free but come in summery dessert flavors like Sherbet Swirl. On social media, the drinks are brandished by members of an official collegiate ambassadors program, gymnasts and cheerleaders whose dewy complexions suggest they’ve never had a hangover or slept through their alarm after a late-night study session.

Alani Nu, which was founded in 2018 by fitness influencer and coach Katy Hearn and acquired by competitor Celsius for $1.8 billion this spring, has styled itself as the nectar that fuels today’s effortlessly high-achieving, hummingbird-like young woman. (You can imagine Margot Robbie cracking open a can in the “Barbie” movie, just before her character experiences an existential breakdown.) Its success shows how the $22 billion energy drink industry, long dominated by labels like Monster and Red Bull that use extreme sports swagger to appeal to young men, is tapping into the aesthetics of health and wellness to reach new demographics and continue its exponential growth.

Many of the newer breeds tout “better for you ingredients” and benefits, from biotin (“oh, that hair skin + nails,” promises the copy on Gorgie) to lion’s mane mushrooms (“boosts memory, focus, and mental clarity,” declares the vaguely intellectual Odyssey). One hedge fund recently said it was betting against the $55 billion Monster empire, predicting it would be edged out by brands that appear more health-conscious.

The problem, health experts say, is the new wellness-themed marketing may be worsening consumer confusion over the risks of energy drinks. Many energy drinks contain supercharged doses of caffeine that are particularly risky for children, teenagers, people who are pregnant or breastfeeding, and people with underlying heart conditions. More surprising may be their potential dangers when working out, particularly since energy drinks are often promoted by fitness influencers and athletes. Researchers also worry the health risks may be compounded when combined with other common energy-drink ingredients like the amino acid taurine and guarana, a plant seed that contains caffeine.

“We’re seeing kids who show up with tachycardia,” or rapid heartbeat, said Mark Corkins, the division chief of pediatric gastroenterology at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center. “Some of them have chest pain and you find out they drink three or four energy drinks a day.”

It’s not just adolescents, Corkins said, but preteens too. He tells parents and kids the same thing: Energy drinks are not benign, nor are they a substitute for sleep.

“People just don’t have any idea of what they’re getting,” said Victoria Vetter, a pediatric cardiologist at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia who co-authored a recent commentary on energy drinks’ risks to young people. She recalls evaluating a 7-year-old patient for an abnormal heart rhythm and asking if he drank any caffeine. Sure enough, his parents had bought him YouTube influencer Logan Paul’s Prime Energy, which contains 200 milligrams of caffeine, after he saw a video game influencer drinking it and asked for one. (The brand also has a caffeine-free drink, Prime Hydration, with similar packaging, albeit in a bottle rather than a can — which critics say creates more potential confusion.)

The American Beverage Association, which represents 94% of the U.S. energy drink market, said in a statement that for more than a decade, its members “have gone beyond all federal requirements when it comes to responsible labeling and marketing practices by displaying total caffeine content from all sources on labels and adhering to a long-standing commitment to not market to children.”

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children under age 12 avoid caffeine entirely, and that adolescents between 12-18 have no more than 100 mg per day. But an estimated 30%-50% of adolescents in the U.S. still consume energy drinks, many of which contain between 160-300 mg of caffeine per can. Some high schools even make them available in vending machines and cafeterias. Making them all the more risky is that many “are marketed in a way that makes them appear not to be energy drinks — not to be highly caffeinated products that could potentially be dangerous,” said Frances Fleming-Milici, director of marketing initiatives at the UConn Rudd Center for Food Policy and Health.

Research has linked energy drinks to cardiovascular issues like arrhythmias and, in rare but potentially fatal cases, sudden cardiac arrest, along with a wide range of health problems like seizures, stomach problems, poor sleep, and higher levels of stress and anxiety. That said, it can be difficult to tell whether energy drinks are a direct cause of such health problems or merely correlated with them. The most recent data from America’s Poison Centers shows an uptick in calls about exposure to energy drinks in children and teens up to age 19, with 2,609 calls in 2024.

Energy drinks, the 24/7 beverage

The health risks of energy drinks were a hot topic in the U.S. about a decade ago. Since then, the market has only grown. As of 2025, there were 254 energy drink businesses in the U.S., compared to just 49 in 2015.

“What we’ve learned over the years is that energy is a need state” for which there’s round-the-clock demand, said Michael Bellas, head of the research and consulting firm Beverage Marketing Corporation. Other than water, he said, energy is the No. 1 fuel that today’s anxious, hassled consumer relies upon: “You can do it 24/7.”

Leaning into that broad appeal, energy drinks are increasingly blending into the broader functional beverage market alongside probiotic sodas, hydrating sports drinks, and adaptogenic elixirs containing ingredients like hemp or ashwagandha meant to help with mood and stress.

The $9 billion Celsius strategically built its brand within the health and beauty category in grocery stores, “next to the Atkins and the protein bars,” as CEO John Fieldly said in a recent interview, and then became affiliated with the wellness movement during Covid. Now the third-most-popular energy drink in the U.S. after Monster and Red Bull, a 12-ounce can of Celsius contains 200 mg of caffeine per can — half of the maximum daily amount considered safe for adults. (Twelve ounces of coffee contains anywhere from 113 mg to 247 mg of caffeine, according to the FDA.) Though it’s labeled as an energy drink, some find it easy to mentally miscategorize: It’s often shelved alongside sparkling and flavored waters in grocery stores, featuring a “Live Fit” motto and minimalist packaging with pictures of berries or passion fruit.

High school and college-age women are drawn to Celsius because it’s low-calorie, experts say, and claims to help speed up metabolism. The Wall Street Journal reports the drinks are popular among young women with eating disorders, who may be more susceptible to adverse effects from too much caffeine. Celsius also markets itself as a pre- or post-workout drink, holding influencer events at the Pilates-inspired gym Solidcore — which also sells cans in studios at a discount to members. “That’s something that is really not recommended to do at any age, is to consume these products and exert yourself and exercise,” said Fleming-Milici.

The American College of Sports Medicine recommends that energy drinks be avoided before, during, and after strenuous activities, noting that some deaths allegedly linked to energy drinks happened under those circumstances. In the past year, Katie Donnell, a teacher who habitually drank three energy drinks a day as part of her workout routine, died after a heart attack at age 28. Eighteen-year-old mixed martial arts athlete Zach Doran, who had a fatal heart attack, reportedly consumed energy drinks regularly. It’s not known whether or to what extent the energy drinks played a role in their deaths.

Other energy drinks are leaning less into wellness and more into partnerships with brands and flavors associated with childhood innocence. Ghost and C4 have energy drinks in varieties like Welch’s Grape, Sour Patch Kids, and Popsicle. If it sounds like those might appeal to young kids, there are several regulatory complaints and a recently dismissed class-action lawsuit that make exactly that argument.

In her research on energy drink consumption among teens and children, Teesside University public health nutrition professor Amelia Lake found that parents were using energy drinks as breakfast substitutes. “The word energy is really positive — it’s going to give you energy and improve concentration,” she said.

Back in 2018, Lake campaigned with celebrity chef Jamie Oliver to curb sales of the product to young people in the U.K., prompting a number of grocery store chains to voluntarily instate age requirements. Energy drinks “remain the fastest-growing sector within the soft drink market,” said Lake, who is also the deputy director of Fuse, an inter-university center for translational research in public health. “They are highly profitable, and their manufacturers will say they are not marketing to children or young people. But when they are associated with everything that is part of youth culture — music, extreme sport — they can’t help being part of youth culture.”

The health risks of energy drinks

The most serious risks of energy drinks involve their impact on the heart, said Vetter, the pediatric cardiologist. “They increase heart rate, do all of these abnormal things — it can increase the likelihood of having a coronary event, a blockage of the artery, or a perforation of the artery,” she said. “Anybody who is more susceptible to these things is going to be more significantly affected, but a lot of people don’t know they’re at risk” — particularly young people who haven’t lived long enough for an underlying heart condition to be identified.

A Mayo Clinic study published last year found that seven out of 144 survivors of sudden cardiac arrest had consumed an energy drink within 12 hours of the event. Four of the survivors had heart rhythm disorders, while three had no clear underlying cause. That’s a small sample size, and the authors note that energy drinks may be just one of several factors contributing to the “perfect storm” of circumstances that led to the sudden cardiac arrest. But they found sufficient evidence to say that energy drinks could be triggering for people with underlying heart disorders, and urged the Food and Drug Administration to provide guidelines about energy drink consumption and risks.



Coffee, of course, also contains caffeine — but it’s less trendy among young people, less concentrated, and less likely to be downed quickly as a pre- or post-workout beverage. And it’s not just the caffeine that’s a potential risk for people with underlying conditions. “The energy drinks have a lot of other substances in them,” Vetter explained, the effects of which are not fully understood.

Beyond heart issues, health experts have also sounded alarms about links between energy drinks and seizures, gastrointestinal problems, dental issues (varieties like Monster often contain as much sugar as soda), and worse mental health — potentially because of all that tossing and turning that over-caffeinated people tend to do instead of sleep. Studies have linked energy drink consumption among young people with higher levels of anxiety, depression, stress, and insomnia.

“What happens is, you feel good immediately and then there’s a big crash,” said Vetter.

Energy drink bans and caffeine labeling proposals

Concerned about the potential harms for people whose bodies are still developing, countries in Europe are increasingly cracking down on sales of energy drinks to minors. Lithuania, Latvia, Turkey, the Galicia region of Spain, and Sweden have age requirements, and more recently Poland and Kazakhstan have followed suit. The U.K. Labor party pledged last year to ban energy drinks for children under 16 if elected to power (they won, though no law has been announced yet), and Czech lawmakers are moving forward with a similar ban.



In the U.S., the Sarah Katz Caffeine Safety Act, a House bill introduced by Rep. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) in March, would introduce some restrictions. Named after Katz, a 21-year-old college student who died from cardiac arrest in 2023 after drinking Panera Bread’s Charged Lemonade, the bill would introduce new requirements, such as a “high caffeine” notice on restaurant menus for beverages with more than 150 mg, and require government agencies to further study the safety of caffeine and other ingredients in energy drinks, as well as energy drinks’ marketing tactics.

With the Make America Healthy Again movement calling attention to the health impacts of sugary drinks like soda and the concern that many people feel over the safety of food ingredients, Menendez is hopeful about the bill’s chances. But for now, the U.S. has comparatively few regulations in place: Previous attempts by Congress and state officials yielded only a voluntary commitment from manufacturers.

Not only is there no minimum age for purchases of energy drinks in the U.S., some are regulated by the FDA as dietary supplements rather than as soft drinks — meaning they can bypass the FDA’s limit of 71 mg of caffeine per 12 ounces of carbonated soda.

Figuring out exactly how much caffeine an energy drink contains requires some detective work, and often a pair of reading glasses. Companies can place information about a drink’s amount of caffeine anywhere on the packaging — often in tiny type and consistently without context about the recommended daily limit.

Alina Yang, a high school junior in New York’s Westchester County, said drinks like Celsius and Red Bull are a common accessory among her classmates. But her family has a history of heart disease, and as the founder of Guardians of the Heart, a nonprofit focused on educating young people about cardiovascular disease prevention, she tries to let her peers know that energy drinks can be a problem. The trouble is, she said, “adolescents don’t do anything until something bad happens to them.”

In a March 2025 letter to the editor for The Journal of Pediatrics, Yang described how influencers on TikTok and elsewhere can make energy drinks seem like not just a habit but a symbol of achievement. The medical students she watches for career inspiration on social media often guzzle the beverages while preparing for exams. The videos, which are sometimes sponsored by energy drink brands, are bound to make people like her wonder: “Oh, if that’s the path I want to go, are those the habits I have to have and the decisions I’d have to make?”

That’s the kind of logic that health experts worry could turn young people into lifelong energy drink customers. “Once we start dietary behaviors,” Lake said, “it’s really hard to change.”

Just like we care for other aspects of our health, there are steps we can take to support brain health and lower the risk of dementia as we age, according to Professor Jonathan Schott, professor of neurology at UCL and chief medical officer at Alzheimer’s Research UK.

Professor Schott has outlined six easy ways to give your brain a boost this summer.

1. Learn a new skill (that you enjoy)

“Keep your brain active by doing the things that you enjoy doing,” recommends Schott. “I’ve previously said, ‘If you hate Sudoku, don’t do Sudoku’ as you’re not going to stick with it.”

It’s more about finding whatever keeps you engaged and stimulated, he emphasises.

“For some people, that’s reading a book, for others it will be playing chess or learning a new skill like crochet,” says Schott.

Learning a new skill, or getting better at a pre-existing one, helps keep your brain flexible, explains the neurology professor.

“What we think is, when you learn new skills, those areas [in the brain] get connected better together and the connections get stronger – that’s why when you repeat a skill over and over and over again then that movement becomes more automatic,” says Schott. “And we think that it probably makes the brain a bit more resilient.”

2. Do something active every day

“I think exercising is the single best thing that we can do,” says Schott. “We talk at Alzheimer’s Research UK about what’s good for your heart is good for your brain, and that’s because lots of the risk factors for your heart are also risk factors for brain diseases as well.

“Exercise can lower your blood pressure, can lower your cholesterol, can take your weight down and gives you a sense of wellbeing.

“Ideally, you want to be doing a little bit of exercise every day and want to be doing something that gets your heart rate substantially elevated for at least 20 minutes three or four times a week.”

There is also growing evidence that suggests exercise can buffer some of the effects of the causes of dementia in the brain.

“The mechanisms aren’t entirely clear, but it’s likely that the chemicals that get released from the muscles get into the brain and may actually alter this,” he adds.

3. Go on regular walks

“What’s really interesting is that it does not need to be hugely vigorous exercise,” says Schott. “We’re not talking about running marathons, we’re talking about walking every day or walking up the stairs rather than taking a lift.

“Some of the research that we’ve done suggests that it’s actually relatively small but sustained amount of activity throughout your life, that may be the most beneficial.”

Walking with others also offers additional valuable social benefits, and Alzheimer’s Research UK is set to host a variety of Walk For A Cure events across the UK this summer – ranging from family-friendly, accessible 5km routes to more challenging 42km hikes.

4. Stay connected

Several studies also suggest that social isolation can raise the risk of dementia, so staying connected with others is a powerful way to support your brain health.

“Do things that you really enjoy doing yourself, but also with other people,” recommends Schott. “Staying connected helps you keep in touch with people, you get feedback on people and you can also compare how your brain performance is to other people’s.

“When I have someone who says to me, I’m a bit worried about my memory, my immediate thought is to say what’s your memory like compared to those people you hang out with?”

5. Get your blood pressure checked

“Keeping an eye on your blood pressure is really important,” says Schott. “We and others have found that it’s your blood pressure in your 30s and your 40s which actually may have the most impact on your brain health.”

The professor explains that monitoring blood pressure is important because dementia generally stems from two main causes: neurodegenerative diseases and cerebrovascular disease, with the latter involving damage to the brain’s blood vessels.

“By reducing the blood pressure, we think we’re probably putting less strain on the blood vessels in the brain, which makes them more robust and less likely to get clogged or less likely to burst,” he explains.

6. Complete Alzheimer's UK’s Think Brain Health Check-in

“I would suggest that everybody does our Think Brain Health Check-in,” recommends Schott. “It’s been used by over half a million people in the UK, and you can go in and you can put in your own personal circumstances, and it’ll ask you questions about things like exercise, smoking, diet and alcohol, and will come up with some easy-to-follow advice.”

The unidentified man who is in his 70s went to the hospital after he saw blood in his stool - believing it was due to the colonoscopy he had the day before.

But while examining him, doctors also noticed large, dark bruises on both of his arms that had developed within the span of a few days.

Tests revealed he was suffering from hemophilia A, where the body prevents blood from clotting, causing excessive bleeding from wounds for days at end.

This prolonged bleeding can cause blood to accumulate beneath the skin, forming a bruise and make the body more susceptible to injuries.

In this particular case, since the patient had sustained wounds from a colorectal procedure, they were mostly bleeding internally and the blood was only visible in their stool.

The patient had no family history of the condition and was not actively bleeding, according to a medical report about his case.

However, they traced his symptoms back a week after the elderly patient had received his Moderna Covid vaccine booster - marking it as his fifth shot.

The experts theorized that it was possible the shot triggered his immune system to produce antibodies against his body's clotting process and caused the disorder.

Doctors traced his symptoms back a week after the elderly patient had received his Moderna Covid vaccine booster - marking it as his fifth shot

Typically, mRNA vaccines work by prompting the immune system to produce SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins to attack the Covid virus in the body through a piece of genetic code.

However, in this case doctors believe that it may be possible that the vaccine also made the body stop recognizing its own cells as safe and began developing antibodies against the clotting process.

Experts have noted that adverse reactions to Covid vaccines are extremely rare and that the benefits of getting the shot outweigh potential complications

After his diagnosis, the experts reviewed 21 cases of AHA developing in patients after receiving Covid vaccines between 2020 to 2022 and discovered that they usually were in their 70s and symptoms tend to show 14 days after receiving the shot.

They also noted that the condition can be fatal in about 10.3 percent of cases which is why early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for survival.

AHA can cause bleeding in the skin, muscles, and soft tissues but more concerningly, it can also lead to internal bleeding, including in the brain and gastrointestinal tract - which if not controlled, can cause the body to start bleeding out and in certain cases, lead to death.

It remains unclear exactly how the vaccine triggered specific clotting antibody production in the patients' bodies.

Most cases OF AHA occurred after people received their first or second dose of the Covid vaccine - when the immune response is highest.

However, this particular man developed the bleeding disorder after his fifth dose - making his case distinct.

When the elderly man initially went to the doctors, his white blood cell count, platelets count, liver and kidney function all appeared normal during tests.

But much to their surprise, the bruising on his arms continued to worsen and he developed large marks on his left knee two weeks later - prompting doctors to order more intensive blood tests which included a plasma test.

Results showed that while his white cell and platelets counts were normal, they were certain antibodies present in his plasma that were not allowing the body's clotting process to function.

Further testing showed that his body's FVIII, crucial protein involved in forming blood clots to stop bleeding, levels were only at one percent in his body.

As a result, he was diagnosed with acquired hemophilia A - which is known to primarily target the FVIII protein in the body.

Typical symptoms of this condition include nosebleeds, bruising throughout the body, solid swellings of congealed blood, blood in the urine and gastrointestinal bleeding.

Consequently, patients also develop also complications associated with abnormal, uncontrolled bleeding into the muscles, skin and soft tissue that can occur spontaneously, during surgery or following trauma.

While it is usually treatable, AHA can potentially cause life-threatening bleeding complications in certain cases.

Experts estimate that the condition affects about two people per a million in the US - meaning that it is diagnosed in nearly 1,000 people in a population of 340 million people.

As for treatment, the elderly man was asked to visit a haematology clinic every week and began taking cyclophosphamide (an immunosuppressant medication used to treat autoimmune diseases).

The doctors progressively decreased his cyclophosphamide dosage as his FVIII levels improved and he showed signs of recovery.

Along with this, he was also given medications to prevent fungal infections and protect the stomach.","A Washington DC man was left excessively bleeding due to a rare side effect linked to his Covid vaccine booster.

Over time, their built-in repair mechanisms also fail. Knee cartilage grinds away. Hip joints no longer support weight. Treatments for breast cancer and other health issues require removal by surgery. Because the body can’t regenerate those tissues, reconstruction using biomaterials is often the only way.

Traditionally, this kind of restoration involves one-size-fits-all breast implants or hip joints. More recently, 3D bioprinted tissues have begun to be tailored for patients. But these artificial tissues are printed outside of the body, and they still require additional surgeries to implant, adding to the chances of scarring, inflammation, or infection, and increasing healing time.

This month, a team from the California Institute of Technology unveiled a system to 3D print tissues inside the body—no surgery needed. Dubbed deep tissue in vivo sound printing (DISP), the system uses an injectable bioink that’s liquid at body temperature but solidifies into structures when blasted with ultrasound. A monitoring molecule, also sensitive to ultrasound, tracks tissue printing in real time. Excess bioink is safely broken down by the body.

In tests, the team 3D printed tissues inside a rabbit’s stomach and mouse’s bladder. They also added conductive nanoparticles to make soft biosensors and depots of medication—anticancer drugs or antibacterial medications—that released their payloads when hit with ultrasound.

“This work has really expanded the scope of ultrasound-based printing and shown its translational capacity,” Yu Shrike Zhang at Harvard Medical School, who was not involved in the research, told IEEE Spectrum. “It’s quite exciting.”

From Light to Sound

Thanks to its versatility, 3D printing has captured the imagination of bioengineers. The technology can be used to make artificial biological tissues, organs, or medical devices.

Bioprinters usually deposit one layer at a time. Each layer is solidified using light, then the next layer is laid on top of it. This layer-by-layer process takes time. More recently, an upgraded method called volumetric printing solidifies 3D structures with a single blast of carefully tailored light. The approach is faster but also constrained by how deeply light can pierce tissues.

Infrared light, for example, can shape implants under a thin layer of skin and muscle, Xiao Kuang at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, who was not involved in the study, wrote in Science. But light dims and scatters the deeper it goes inside the body. This limits the “direct printing of implants beneath millimeter-thick tissues”—or barely below the skin.

Ultrasound, best known for its use monitoring pregnancies, has an advantage here. It can reach deep into organs—nearly eight inches—without damaging them. Scientists have been exploring focused ultrasound, which blasts a certain frequency of soundwaves towards a tissue, as a way to monitor brain and muscle activity.

Ultrasound can also trigger chemical reactions. In 2023, Zhang and colleagues engineered a molecular concoction dubbed “sono-ink” that solidifies when blasted with a specific frequency of sound waves. The team 3D printed multiple shapes inside isolated pork belly, liver, and kidneys and patched tissue damage in a goat heart.

But the ink was sensitive to stress and other disruptions in the body, resulting in slower printing and poor resolution. Sound waves also generate heat, which hardened some of the sono-ink before it had formed the intended structures. Further, other molecules in the ink and local heat spikes across tissues increased biocompatibility risk.

“Ultrasound 3D printing inside a body is more challenging than it seems,” wrote Kuang.

A New Ink

The new system relies on upgraded sono-ink.

The ink has multiple components combined into a single concoction. First up are chains of molecules that normally float about freely but grasp each other when given a molecular cue. These are accompanied by fatty bubbles filled with binder molecules—the molecular cue—that release their payloads when exposed to ultrasound. A final encapsulated component includes multiple chemicals that scatter sound waves and light up when certain soundwaves hit. These help the team visualize the ink’s location and determine if it’s formed the desired structure.

The new setup “prevented premature chemical reactions at body temperature and provided better control of the printing process,” wrote Kuang.","This month, a team from the California Institute of Technology unveiled a system to 3D print tissues inside the body—no surgery needed.

Drug addiction poses a global public health challenge, with limited therapeutic options and modest efficacy. While numerous studies have shown that social status profoundly impacts mental health and addiction susceptibility, its neural mechanisms remain unclear.

Now, however, a research team led by Prof. ZHU Yingjie from the Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology (SIAT) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has revealed the neural mechanisms by which social rank influences vulnerability to drug addiction.

To understand these mechanisms, the researchers used both pharmacological and optogenetic approaches to manipulate dopamine signaling. Credit: Neuroscience News

The study was published in Nature Neuroscience on May 12.

Using a suite of cutting-edge neuroscience tools such as fiber photometry, fast-scan cyclic voltammetry, optogenetic manipulation, and volumetric imaging, the researchers explored both functional and structural differences in the dopamine systems of male rodents occupying different social ranks.

These tools allowed them to measure real-time neuronal activity, detect rapid chemical changes (particularly dopamine), manipulate neural circuits with light, and capture high-speed 3D images of brain activity.

The findings revealed that an animal’s social rank influences its tendency to seek methamphetamine (METH) by affecting the mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways—two key dopamine pathways in the brain.

The mesolimbic pathway delivers dopamine to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and promotes reward-seeking behavior, whereas the mesocortical pathway, which projects to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and supports executive control, helping suppress compulsive drug use.

“Low-ranking mice exhibit a stronger ‘reward’ circuit and a weaker ‘control’ circuit —like a high-powered car with faulty brakes—making them more likely to seek drugs. In contrast, high-ranking mice have a more balanced system, with effective ‘brakes’ that help them resist addiction,” explained Prof. ZHU.

To understand these mechanisms, the researchers used both pharmacological and optogenetic approaches to manipulate dopamine signaling.

When dopamine-related proteins in the NAc of low-ranking male mice were reduced, their METH-seeking behavior declined. In contrast, when dopamine fibers in the mPFC of high-ranking male mice were damaged, drug-seeking behavior increased.

Most strikingly, activating the mesocortical dopamine pathway via optogenetic stimulation not only made the mice win a social competition test more often; it also made them much less likely to seek METH in subsequent trials.

Notably, the study also found that these effects were sex-specific: Female mice exhibited METH-seeking behavior regardless of social rank, suggesting different neurobiological underpinning of addiction risk in male and females.

Importantly, the researchers found that introducing winning experiences to low-ranking male mice not only elevated their social rank but also reduced later drug-seeking behavior. These behavioral changes were linked to functional and structural remodeling in both the mesocortical and mesolimbic dopamine pathways.

This study introduces a novel neurobiological framework linking social status, dopamine circuit dynamics, and addiction vulnerability.

“By boosting an individual’s sense of social achievement or simulating successful experiences, it may be possible—at the neural level—to ‘strengthen the brakes and ease off the accelerator,’ thereby reducing addiction risk,” said Prof. ZHU.

He noted that the study also supports the development of non-invasive stimulation therapies aimed at reducing addiction vulnerability.

“Social rank modulates methamphetamine-seeking in dominant and subordinate male rodents via distinct dopaminergic pathways” by ZHU Yingjie et al. Nature Neuroscience

Abstract

Social rank modulates methamphetamine-seeking in dominant and subordinate male rodents via distinct dopaminergic pathways

Social status has a profound impact on mental health and propensity towards drug addiction. However, the neural mechanisms underlying the effects of social rank on drug-seeking behavior remain unclear.

Here we found that dominant male rodents (based on the tube test) had denser mesocortical dopaminergic projections and were more resistant to methamphetamine (METH)-seeking, whereas subordinates had heightened dopaminergic function in the mesolimbic pathway and were more vulnerable to METH seeking.

Optogenetic activation of the mesocortical dopaminergic pathway promoted winning and suppressed METH seeking in subordinates, whereas lesions of the mesocortical pathway increased METH seeking in dominants.

Elevation of social rank with forced win training in subordinates led to remodeling of the dopaminergic system and prevented METH-seeking behavior.

In females, however, both ranks were susceptible to METH seeking, with mesocorticolimbic pathways comparable to those in subordinate males.

These results provide a framework for understanding the neural basis of the impact of social status on drug-seeking.","Summary: A new study reveals how social rank influences addiction vulnerability by altering dopamine pathways in the brain.

2025-05-12 17:57:11,2025-05-13 01:57:11 +08,https://www.earth.com/news/hospital-superbugs-devour-medical-plastics-boosting-infection-risks/,"Hospital 'superbugs' devour medical plastics, boosting infection risks","Scientists have discovered that a notorious hospital bacterium can digest the very plastics used in sutures, stents, and surgical mesh. By turning the polymer into food, the microbe may cling more stubbornly to devices and linger longer on ward surfaces.

Researchers from Brunel University London, working with a patient-derived strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, found that the pathogen dismantles polycaprolactone (PCL), a biodegradable plastic common in modern medicine.

The insight challenges the assumption that clinical polymers are immune to microbial attack.

Turning hospital plastics into food

The team traced the plastic-eating trick to a single enzyme, which they named Pap1. In laboratory tests, Pap1 reduced a thin PCL film by seventy-eight percent within seven days. The bacterium then used the liberated fragments as its sole carbon source.

“It means we need to reconsider how pathogens exist in the hospital environment,” said professor Ronan McCarthy, who led the study.

“Plastics, including plastic surfaces, could potentially be food for these bacteria. Pathogens with this ability could survive for longer in the hospital environment. It also means that any medical device or treatment that contains plastic could be susceptible to degradation by bacteria.”

PCL is prized because it bends without snapping, melts at low temperatures, and gradually dissolves in the body. Those traits make it ideal for resorbable sutures, drug-delivery patches, and soft tissue scaffolds.

Until now, surgeons assumed the material would vanish only through hydrolysis and harmless metabolic clearance. Pap1 shows that microbes can accelerate the process – and exploit it.

Plastic boosts bacterial defenses

When P. aeruginosa chews up plastic, it gains more than nourishment. The broken polymer pieces help the cells weave tougher biofilms, those gluey communal layers that resist disinfectants, immune cells, and multiple classes of antibiotics.

Catheter-related urinary tract infections and ventilator-associated pneumonia already rank among the hardest hospital infections to treat. PCL degradation could fortify the culprit’s defenses, complicating therapy even further.

The World Health Organization lists P. aeruginosa among the top “critical” pathogens in need of new drugs. Its uncanny ability to evolve resistance and to thrive in damp, nutrient-poor niches makes it a frequent cause of persistent outbreaks.

The study showed that plastic may be an unexpected reservoir of calories, tipping survival odds further in the germ’s favor.

More bacteria may digest plastic

The researchers looked at genetic databases and spotted related enzyme blueprints in other bacteria known to haunt intensive-care units.

Though only PCL digestion was proven, the sequence hints suggest that plastics such as polyurethane or polyethylene terephthalate – used in everything from vascular grafts to wound dressings – might also be vulnerable.

“The bug’s plastic-eating ability is likely helping it survive on surfaces in hospitals, potentially driving hospital outbreaks. We should start to consider focusing on plastics that are harder for microbes to digest and potentially screening pathogens for these enzymes, especially in unexplained prolonged outbreaks,” McCarthy said.

That prospect affects far more than one operating theatre. Cardiac stents, breast implants, dental membranes and bone fillers all rely on polymers for flexibility and strength. If any of those materials can be metabolized, latent infections might smolder undetected until biofilms reach critical mass.

Designing safer plastics

One response is to redesign polymers so their chemical bonds resist enzymatic cleavage. Another is to coat device surfaces with inert barriers or embedded antimicrobials that deny bacteria a foothold.

Any such solution must preserve the mechanical virtues that made PCL popular in the first place while preventing degradation inside the body.

Research chemists may also mine Pap1 itself for clues. By mapping its active site, they could predict which molecular motifs invite attack and which repel it. That information could steer the next generation of hospital plastics toward safer territory.

Rethinking hospital surveillance

Hospitals already culture swabs from taps, beds, and keyboard covers. The new data suggest laboratories should add targeted searches for plastic-digesting enzymes.

Environmental isolates that test positive might explain outbreaks whose source has eluded standard surveillance. Cleaning protocols could likewise shift focus: scrubbing away visible grime is not enough if bacteria can tuck inside the polymer and nibble at its chains.

McCarthy emphasizes that the present work is an early step. It examined one strain, one enzyme, and one polymer under controlled conditions. Real-world environments mix many microbes, variable temperatures, and diverse materials.

“Plastic is everywhere in modern medicine, and it turns out some pathogens have adapted to degrade it, and we need to understand the impact this has on patient safety,” McCarthy said.

Next experiments on the horizon

Future studies will test explanted devices for microscopic bite marks, track enzyme genes across hospital genomes and expose other medical plastics to potential degraders.

Animal models may reveal whether in-body digestion changes implant strength or releases inflammatory by-products. Parallel work on coatings and polymer chemistry will explore defenses.

For now, the image is sobering: a superbug perched on a catheter, slowly digesting the tube meant to heal, using the fragments to thicken its fortress and bide its time. The finding upends old assumptions and signals that in the quiet corners of a ward, plastic may not be inert at all – but a secret feast for the enemy within.

The study is published in the journal Cell Reports.

A mouse study revealed that CAR-T-induced immune responses activate brain microglia, triggering inflammation that damages myelin-producing cells, reducing signal efficiency in the brain.

These effects mirror brain fog seen after chemotherapy and mild respiratory infections like COVID-19. Importantly, researchers identified two treatment strategies that reversed the impairment in mice, paving the way for potential therapies in humans.

Key Facts:

Independent Cause: CAR-T therapy alone can cause cognitive impairment, regardless of tumor location.

After treatment with CAR-T cells — immune cells engineered to attack cancer — patients sometimes tell their doctors they feel like they have “brain fog,” or forgetfulness and difficulty concentrating.

A new Stanford Medicine-led study shows that CAR-T cell therapy causes mild cognitive impairments, independent of other cancer treatments, and that this happens via the same cellular mechanism as cognitive impairment from two other causes: chemotherapy and respiratory infections such as flu and COVID-19.

The study, conducted mostly in mice, which will publish online May 12 in Cell, also identifies strategies for reversing the problem.

Medications that ameliorate brain fog will enable better recovery from cancer immunotherapies, the researchers said.

“CAR-T cell therapy is enormously promising: We are seeing long-term survivors after CAR-T cell therapy for aggressive cancers, saving patients who would otherwise have died,” said the study’s senior author, Michelle Monje, MD, PhD, the Milan Gambhir Professor in Pediatric Neuro-Oncology.

“We need to understand all its possible long-term effects, including this newly recognized syndrome of immunotherapy-related cognitive impairment, so we can develop therapeutic approaches to fix it.”

The study’s lead authors are Anna Geraghty, PhD, senior staff scientist in the Monje lab, and MD/PhD student Lehi Acosta-Alvarez.

Cognitive impairment after CAR-T cell therapy is typically mild; patients are not developing dementia, for instance. But it is frustrating and may not resolve on its own, Monje said.

In mice, her team reversed the impairment using compounds similar to existing medications or medications in clinical development — meaning a treatment could be available relatively quickly, she said.

“We’re deeply interested in how cancer therapies affect cognition because it affects patients’ quality of life,” Monje said.

“And this is especially important for kids because their brains are still developing.”

Investigating brain fog

CAR-T cell therapy was approved for acute lymphoblastic leukemia in 2017. The treatment involves removing some of the patient’s own immune cells, known as T cells, and engineering them to attack targets on cancer cells. The modified T cells are returned to the patient’s body, where they recognize and destroy cancer.

In addition to leukemia, CAR-T cells are now used to treat other blood cancers, including multiple myeloma and some kinds of lymphoma, and they are being tested in clinical trials for various solid tumors.

Monje and her colleagues have an ongoing trial of CAR-T cells for deadly brain stem and spinal cord tumors in children, which is beginning to show success.

Although patients report brain fog after CAR-T cell therapy, studies to measure how much cognitive impairment the therapy causes are only just emerging.

The research team wanted to get a comprehensive understanding of the situations in which CAR-T cell therapy might cause cognitive impairment. They studied mice that had tumors induced in the brain, blood, skin and bone.

The researchers wanted to understand the influence on cognition of CAR-T cell treatment in combination with the tumors’ location (originating in, spreading to or staying outside the brain), as well as the degree to which the engineered cells evoked additional, accompanying immune responses.

Before and after CAR-T cell treatment, the researchers used standard cognitive tests on the mice, measuring how mice responded to a novel object and navigated a simple maze.

CAR-T therapy caused mild cognitive impairment in mice with cancers originating in, metastasizing to and located completely outside the brain.

The only mice tested that did not develop cognitive impairment after CAR-T treatment were those that had bone cancer that causes minimal additional inflammation beyond the cancer-fighting activity of the CAR-T cells.

“This is the first study to demonstrate that immunotherapy on its own is sufficient to cause lasting cognitive symptoms,” Monje said.

“It’s also the first paper to uncover the mechanisms. We found the exact same pathophysiology we’ve seen in brain fog syndromes that occur after chemotherapy, radiation, and mild respiratory COVID-19 or influenza.”

The researchers demonstrated that the brain’s immune cells, called microglia, are key players in the problem. First, the microglia become activated by the body’s immune response.

The activated, “annoyed” microglia produce inflammatory immune molecules known as cytokines and chemokines, which in turn have widespread effects throughout the brain.

They are particularly harmful for oligodendrocytes, the brain cells responsible for making myelin, the fatty substance that insulates nerve fibers and helps nerves transmit signals more efficiently.

Reduction in the nerves’ insulation translates into cognitive impairment.

The scientists also analyzed samples of brain tissue from human subjects who participated in the team’s ongoing clinical trial of CAR-T cells for spinal cord and brain stem tumors.

Using postmortem tissue samples, the researchers confirmed that microglia and oligodendrocytes appear dysregulated in the same way the team had observed in mice after CAR-T therapy.

In mice, the research team tested strategies to resolve the cognitive problems. They gave a compound that depleted microglia in the brains of the mice for a two-week period. After that transient depletion, the microglia returned in the brain in a normal, non-reactive state. The mice were no longer cognitively impaired.

The researchers also gave the mice a medication that enters the brain and interferes with signals from damaging chemokines, blocking a specific receptor for these molecules.

“That alone rescued cognition,” Monje said, adding that the researchers are now exploring how to safely translate the two strategies — transiently depleting microglia or interrupting chemokine signals — in people who have had CAR-T cell therapy.

“This research further illustrates that there is a unifying principle underpinning brain fog syndromes,” Monje said. “And this particular study is so exciting because not only have we identified the cells central to this pathophysiology, we’ve found a molecular target we can investigate to treat it.”

Researchers from New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine and from Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, also contributed to the research.

“Immunotherapy-related cognitive impairment after CAR T cell therapy in mice” by Michelle Monje et al. Cell

Abstract

Immunotherapy-related cognitive impairment after CAR T cell therapy in mice

Immunotherapies have revolutionized cancer care for many tumor types, but their potential long-term cognitive impacts are incompletely understood.

Here, we demonstrated in mouse models that chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy for both central nervous system (CNS) and non-CNS cancers impaired cognitive function and induced a persistent CNS immune response characterized by white matter microglial reactivity, microglial chemokine expression, and elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytokines and chemokines.

Consequently, oligodendroglial homeostasis and hippocampal neurogenesis were disrupted.

Single-nucleus sequencing studies of human frontal lobe from patients with or without previous CAR T cell therapy for brainstem tumors confirmed reactive states of microglia and oligodendrocytes following treatment.

In mice, transient microglial depletion or CCR3 chemokine receptor blockade rescued oligodendroglial deficits and cognitive performance in a behavioral test of attention and short-term memory function following CAR T cell therapy.

Taken together, these findings illustrate targetable neural-immune mechanisms underlying immunotherapy-related cognitive impairment.","“CAR-T cell therapy is enormously promising: We are seeing long-term survivors after CAR-T cell therapy for aggressive cancers, saving patients who would otherwise have died,” said the study’s senior author, Michelle Monje, MD, PhD, the Milan Gambhir Professor in Pediatric Neuro-Oncology.

The emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (H5N1) in the US has put poultry and dairy farms on high alert, resulting in culls that are devastating the industries, and fears it could transform into a human pandemic.

We've seen reports of infections in cats, but new research from the University of Maryland in the US suggests feline cases – and the risk of transmission from cats to humans – is not being taken seriously enough.

""Bird flu is very deadly to cats, and we urgently need to figure out how widespread the virus is in cat populations to better assess spillover risk to humans,"" University of Maryland airborne infectious disease researcher Kristen Coleman says.

This is particularly crucial as birds in the United States make their springtime migrations, potentially spreading the virus further afield.

""As summer approaches, we are anticipating cases on farms and in the wild to rise again,"" Coleman adds.

Coleman and her co-author, animal scientist Ian Bemis, analyzed peer-reviewed research published between 2004 and 2024, finding 607 reported cases of bird flu infection in cats globally. Across 18 countries and 12 species (ranging from house cats to zoo tigers), 302 deaths were associated with the virus.

The researchers believe that a lack of monitoring means these numbers are a serious underestimation.

They noticed that in 2023, reports of pet cat infections increased drastically. In 2023 and 2024, there was a spike in the number of pet cats infected with, and killed by, bird flu.

Most cases can be attributed to the deadliest strain of bird flu, H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b, which had a 90 percent case fatality rate within the data. However, this rate may not reflect the actual risk of death to cats if infected, since testing has been very limited.

The authors urge authorities, veterinarians, and pet owners to increase surveillance of cats.

""We want to help protect both people and pets,"" Coleman says.

There are no confirmed cases of cat-to-human transmission for this particular strain of bird flu, although in 2016, the outbreak of a different strain among cats in New York City animal shelters did result in cat-to-human transmission.

Human-to-human transmission is yet to be recorded, but researchers are concerned this ability may only be a few genetic mutations away.

Nonetheless, Coleman and Bemis note that owners of farm cats, free-roaming cats, veterinarians, zookeepers, and animal shelter volunteers may have a higher risk of exposure to bird flu through interspecies transmissions.

Hunting is in a cat's nature. A free-range cat can kill around 186 animals each year. Besides protecting wildlife and saving on vet bills, this might be another good reason to transition your beloved companion to an indoor lifestyle.

Cats become infected by hunting and eating infected wild birds and mammals, or by consuming infected raw pet food or raw cow's milk – including products sold commercially. They can also catch the virus from other mammals they live alongside, including cats in the neighborhood and, potentially, their owners.

""Our future research will involve studies to determine the prevalence of high pathogenicity avian influenza and other influenza viruses in high-risk cat populations such as dairy barn cats,"" Bemis says.

The research is published in Open Forum Infectious Diseases.","Cats infected with bird flu are falling under the radar when it comes to tracking and managing the virus, and this must change rapidly, scientists warn in a new paper.
